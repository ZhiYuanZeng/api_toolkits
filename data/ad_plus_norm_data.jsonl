Because in the house there is a lot of furniture. Therefore it is necessary to dismantle and pack, which makes transportation more convenient and safe. A way not too picky and straightforward, with just 5 minutes you can remove and install a bed by yourself. Just follow these steps, you can entirely complete them in the fastest way to move into a new home.\nRemoving and installing beds can be considered heavy work, making many people “most afraid” when moving. Besides having a large volume, the bed is very easy to be damaged if it is not removed carefully. It is the reason why many homeowners do not dare to let the employees of the transportation company support them. So they must remove it by themselves.\nWhy should you know the steps for removing and installing wooden beds?\nFor many homeowners, the bed is the most critical thing in their house. The style of decoration and color in the bedroom space must take the bed as the central element.\nFirstly, the bed must be of a size suitable for users and suitable for the area of the room. The height of a bed is also important to note: beds have a moderate height (especially for young children and the elderly). Selecting coaches with adequate height will help room space more spacious\nSecondly, beds should use good wood material with the best level for the user’s health, for example, natural wood. Avoid using metal beds because this material causes cold air and affects sleep quality.\nThirdly, the bed must have a high aesthetic and creating attraction. The style of the couch must be in harmony with the interior architecture in the bedroom.\nWith these factors, the bed is a high-value object in the house; thus it needs care and conserves cautiously. Understanding the steps to remove and install wooden beds, it will help homeowners avoid damage during use or when moving home. Moreover, with this knowledge, the homeowner can observe and monitor the transportation company employees that Did they properly remove and install the bed? Which avoids the broken bed condition. Not only that, the homeowner can remove and assemble the bed by themselves so that homeowners can be more assured about this issue.\nBefore proceeding to remove the bed, you need to identify the components of the bed. The structure of the bed usually has the main parts: bed frame, bed legs, support panels, and cut slats\nClassify beds:\nThere are many types of wooden beds. The two most common types of beds are beds has joints and screw-catching beds. Each kind of bed, there will also be different ways to remove and mount.\nBeds with joints:\nArticulated beds are removable and straightforward bed types, and the edges are joined together by bones that are chiseled tightly and without screws. For this type of bed, use the hammer to tap until it is loose gradually.\nBeds have screws:\nFor those types of the couch with screws, the dismantling stages need more complicated techniques and must have specialized tools to remove: drill, hex wrenches, screwdriver\nFirst, use the drill (you should use the best drill presses and best wood drill bit ), push the screws out, then use the hex wrenches to remove the screw, remove the screws in each connection between the bed edge and the bed body\nSteps when removing wooden beds\nStep 1: Carry out dismantling pillows, mattresses and bed sheets\nAfter removing the cushion, the pad, you need to cover it carefully to prevent it from getting dirty when moving. For beds, you use PE to wrap; this will help prevent scratches or tearing when transporting, which affect the value of the product. The pillow should not be placed in a covered bag because it is easy to generate moisture, cause bad smell and is a place of bacteria.\nStep 2: Remove support panels and cut slats of the bed.\nAfter removing support panels of the bed, continue to remove the cut slats of the bed. Then use tape to attach all the cut slats\nStep 3: Remove the bed frame.\nAfter removing the bed frame, use PE to cover it thoroughly, should cover two front (outside) of the bed and cover them (this helps to prevent scratches during transport)\nAssembling wooden frame bed\nThe reassembly of the wooden frame bed is very simple, and you need to reverse the steps of dismantling the bed.\nWhen removing the wooden frame bed to ensure the quality and value of the bed, you should use carton or foam boxes to surround the outside; it will avoid the bedsides from scratches and chips. Beds should also be limited to moving, removing and installing to ensure firmly and stability, safe to use. So you need to assemble the joints and screw carefully.\nIf the removal of wooden beds makes it difficult for you, there are now many transportation services, they remove, install and pack wooden frame beds. You can hire a service to ensure efficiency when moving. But you should choose reputable places to make sure your belongings are transferred to your new home is intact.\n", "final_result_str": "no", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "a1509608-8bcd-46f7-bab7-420457b30825", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 介绍如何更快的搬家拆家具，语义通顺"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "da4d2f10-2b77-4e3b-86e6-ac54b813666c", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "搬家广告，错误较少"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "d9ee4d81-4ab4-4439-8ee2-f2feed127109", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "步骤清晰，有逻辑"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "5ed2c251-7715-4a70-b01c-e805638571e4", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "介绍怎么安装床"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

See if this is familiar:\n- You have a bright child, who is interested in many things, but not reading. Your child loves listening to you reading books though!\n- Your child has made some progress, but repeatedly guesses short, common words, sometimes after reading them on the very last page. You see your child read some long words fluently though, like magic.\n- Your child’s progress seems to be slowing rather than accelerating. You are worried about a collapse of confidence. You may even feel that you are losing the bright, happy child you knew for the first 6 years.\n- Your child’s spelling in free writing is totally atrocious, despite weeks and weeks of spelling lists! It’s like pushing water up a hill.\n- You have been told to “…just do more reading practice“. But that is getting harder and harder, not easier. It might sometimes even turn into a battle.\n- You love reading yourself and you may easily have another child who has been learning to read fine. So you really feel it is not about how you have been helping or how much reading your child has done. Something else is going on which remains unexplained.\nYes… you really are in a tough, worrying and puzzling situation. I was there too as a parent, by the way, many years ago. But I have good news for you.\nWe set out in 2008 to crush this problem, finally. We have succeeded.\nMy team has now worked with thousands and thousands of children showing exactly those patterns and in recent years every child has progressed well on the new systems we use. Then their spelling generally starts to take shape too, as a sort-of free bonus!\nAfter years of R&D here in Oxford we can now guarantee (see below) that you can drop the worry and stress over the next few weeks. I can promise you that it will be fine, if you follow our simple instructions.\nLearn why you are seeing these patterns\nI think you are going to like this. An answer at last!\nThe reason your bright child is showing these frustrating patterns is because of the natural inclination your child has to memorise whole words visually, instead of leaning towards trying to decode them (from letters to sounds). That has allowed some progress, but has made all those short, interchangeable words very hard to get right. They all look the same! And the context often does not give it away. With long words the context often makes them obvious and so the guess works.\nOften this pattern is triggered by a very strong visual memory (a situation we call optilexia). It can also come from a bit of glue ear when the child is very small, which delays the development of their auditory processing a bit.\nMany of the children we help are actually some of the brightest in their class! It is a tragedy for them to be feeling inadequate. It is their super-bright visual learning style that has led them down the wrong path. They were not to know it was a dead end.\nAll we have to do is change that whole word technique and things will drop into place fairly quickly. Conventional phonics often does not achieve that, but our new trainertext visual phonics approach (TVP) does, every time.\nIn just 15 minutes per day of fun, easy online reading practice with our trainertext, you will see a new child, even from Day 1. We normally see a clear breakthrough in 60-90 days and full reading confidence developing soon after.\nNew century, new technology\nWhen an approach has not worked after months or years, it’s time to try something new:\n- The old, 20th century methods have always failed lots of bright children.\n- Our system uses the child’s neural strengths to make it easy.\n- We have been testing and refining this system since 2008.\nComplete support for you\nWhile our lessons are online, our support is very human:\n- We will support and guide you all the way in our messaging system and over the phone.\n- You can talk to us at any time. Give us a call today for a chat!\n- Our mission is 100% success and we will do whatever is necessary to achieve that success for your child.\nFree Assessment, Free Analysis & 10 Lesson Free Trial\nWe want to make this easy for you to test:\n- Free assessment of your child’s reading and spelling patterns.\n- Free analysis of what the cause of difficulty has been.\n- Free use of the system (with support & prizes) for ten lessons.\nMotivation and fun for your child\nIf you have ever tried to drag a horse to water, you will know it is hard! And they don’t have to drink when they get there. So we aim to get your child wanting to do our lessons:\n- Most children enjoy the games and ask to do them.\n- They feel themselves succeeding for the first time with reading.\n- We have some good prizes, to reinforce that sense of success.\nGuaranteed Success\nWe don’t want anyone to feel that they have wasted money on our systems and our mission is 100% success:\n- Check the details of our guarantee.\n- Last year we were asked for just 4 refunds per 1000 children.\n- We ramp our support until we get the right outcome for every child.\nEvidence of Success\nIt is normal to be skeptical of the new and doubtful of the sort of bold claims we are making here. But here is some evidence to help you understand that it is real:\n- User testimonials on our Facebook Page and posts\n- Scientific trial data\n- Free trial and guarantee. We would not be here if it didn’t work!\nThe Easyread System details\nThere is a lot of information on this site, but here are a few key elements:\n- Our new approach is called trainertext visual phonics (TVP). It is new and unique.\n- It helps a child decode words without confusing “phonic rules” (which often don’t work!).\n- Each lesson is just 15 minutes per day.\n- The lessons are online, so you can access them from anywhere.\n- We base a lot of the process around games and play.\n- Our support team will check everything is on track, throughout the process. This is a big part of the cost, but we have found it to be essential for 100% success.\nPricing\n- The baseline assessment and first ten lessons are free.\n- The cost of Easyread after that is £132 per month, including all lessons, unlimited support, assessments and regular prizes for your child. This price includes a discount for the times you are away and go on holiday.\n- Siblings get a 20% discount (although we recommend waiting until you have reached lesson 30 before starting a second child.\nStart Your Free Trial Today\nJust click the link below to get started with your trial.

He said he is going to create RD of about 4K for creating Emergency Fund.\nRest 6K in Equity MF for various goals. After Emergency Fund is in place he will include that 4K also into investing for future goals.\nHe said 3 months of expense as EF . His monthly expense include Home EMI about 25k + Household Expense 8K + other misc 5K\n25+8+5=38K*3= 1.14L as EF\nI advised him to keep aside at least 6 months as EF ie 38*6=2.28L+buffer and round off =2.5L\nNow the question is with 4k in RD it takes approximately 5 years (60 months) to create this EF\nInstead if he put in all of 10K surplus in RD it will only take 2 year to create same amount .\nI suggested him to put in 10K and make sure EF is in place first. But he doesnt want to miss out on opportunity available in market due to uncertainty to purchase more units with low NAV in his MF Funds\nSo What is best Keep 4K RD and create EF within 5 year (put in yearly bonuses will bring this to 3 years)\nOr\nRD for all 10K and create EF under 2 years (may be in 1.5 year)?\nHi\nEmergency fund need to be highly liquid… please dont go for RD.\nI guess the investor is so conservative.so i suggest him the below one\nHe can go for a sweep account . i shared u a link\nhttp://www.moneysavingshelp.com/2011/bank-2/how-to-get-higher-interest-on-your-savings-account/\nShort explanation:\nU are allowed to specify a particular amount above which it will be swept from your savings acc on a particular date of the month and kept in fixed deposits for every 1000 units. Their lies the advantage. say 10000 swept from my account i am withdrawing 1000 remaining 9000 will be getting the fd interest. Till the date when u with draw 10000 will be given fd interest.Many banks are offering this different names.\nEg. sbi saving plus account —Multi deposit option\nThis is a must one for every induvidual.\nAs the interest incurred on fixed deposits and RD are taxable.If he chooses this fixed deposit (Sweep account) he will get more interest and no penal interest will be deducted if you withdraw it intermediately.\nThis solves the purpose of emergency fund and also earns highest interest rate.\nShortcomings with the RD:\nU cant take out immediately (u are allowed with some interest deduction).\nless interest than fd.\nIn both the cases we need to pay tax on the interest. then why should he go for low interest scheme?\nif he wants some other option\n1. liquid funds and debt funds….\nIn this uncertain world we need to keep the emergency fund and that too liquidity is also important.\nHappy Investing!!!!!!!!\n", "final_result_str": "no", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "1850d929-612e-49f0-8035-3d5fed8552d1", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "网页：好像是针对印度的英文投资理财网页\n语法：错误48个，低水平写作\n营销型内容：关于投资理财的建议\n思路：讨论合适的投资理财方案"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "08b82bb4-754e-4f71-a8f3-e2bfa2c0f403", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "逻辑混乱，语法错误多"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "089e5600-1a83-4161-80e3-f7548e076dde", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "- grammarly：语法错误较多\n- 句子间的关联性较差"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "4e1f1d35-97ff-42fc-99be-45361080098c", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "投资理财相关\n语法错误53个"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

This “external use” has now developed into a real trend. Many of the perfumes for women are quite intrusive. Men’s perfumes, on the other hand, convince with subtle low notes.

You seem so much more serious and also more dynamic. You can also go for Initio perfume in this regard.\nSo, feel free to experiment with the scents of your loved one, because with male scent nuances you can support your own femininity with an interesting accent.

Someone was clearly playing some kind of twisted game with us. Garbed as our captor’s favorite horror movie characters, we were locked away and left to our own devices to find our way out. This horror escape room had us on edge as each of us were challenged to overcome obstacles with merely a trace of help from our trusted comrades.\nCrossroads, also the creator of The Fun House, has really outdone themselves with this escape room experience. It is refreshing to experience a room that delivers awe-inspiring moments around each corner.\nThe start of our experience with Crossroads was pretty average- a nice waiting room and signing waivers. However, upon entering the game, you will notice the quality of the set and structure of this room is visually remarkable! With each member of the team in their own uniquely-themed chamber, each of us was granted a totally different experience. Is it actually scary? In my opinion, no. There are no startles or gore related décor. However, if you are sensitive to even slightly creepy themes, you may disagree with me.\nThe Hex Room is a prime example for how space can be used to make your players feel more fully immersed. Playing The Detective, I got to see each of the players in their own environment (through barred windows or tiny slots). It was my duty to help others in their own path and make connections between them, which of course brought an entire new level of involvement to this scenario.\nThe puzzles were well integrated, many of them overlapping between the multiple themes within the room. Though the types of puzzles were not entirely unique, they were extremely well executed. There are a lot of them, and we did find them rather difficult. However, this game is designed to where you can absolutely come back to play another character with an entirely new set of puzzles to face. There is even a BONUS game (best left for after the end so you don’t run out of time).\nI think that everyone should visit The Hex Room to see what a quality game really looks like. Even if you are like us and don’t get very far, the experience is really worth it. This room will absolutely spoil experienced players who are tired of the usual escape room experience, and will blow the minds of new players! Play this room.

The event was the culmination of three months of incubation through the first Lost Labs program. Run by Charles Adler, co-founder of Kickstarter and founder of Lost Arts, Lost Labs is an opportunity to \"[apply] ambition, to explore the potential of curiosity,\" for \"anyone with a tenacious creative spirit.\"\nAs part of the first cohort, there was a loose framework for us to structure our goals and a timeline to achieve it. I found myself motivated to challenge myself and reach higher than I had initially outlined. The result for Starkweather was a full-on new business plan and pitch that has been updated to reflect all the lessons learned, all the new resources that are available, and the forecast of where the industry and consumer behavior is going in the future.\nThe capstone event gave me a platform to share those organized thoughts to a group of intelligent, curious professionals who then had an opportunity to come speak with the founder (myself), see the products, try them on, and share their feedback. I walked away inspired with new ideas, and excited to get the product into waiting customers' hands. That excitement will serve me well, as motivation and foundation to overcome the challenges to come. Truth: the hard work begins now.\nWriting this on a 30º day in mid-April, I know even as I wait for the warm weather to come, that getting cold-weather product to market for fall 2018 will keep me occupied until the weather turns cold again.\nOver the next several months, I will be getting the word out, taking lots of meetings and copious notes, and building out the resources to make the Fall's launch a catalyst for Starkweather's future success.\nThank you to Charles and Elizabeth @LostArts, and to the rest of the cohort founders.\n2018/1 Cohort Companies:\nCoLab\nFounded by Louis Vowell, CoLab is an online collaboration platform that connects artists and alumni from different art universities across the country. CoLab was created to alleviate post-graduation isolation, with the aim of facilitating cross-campus communication and producing collaborative artworks.\nFertile Design\nFertile Design is a biodegradable plastic, partially made of food waste, that is chemically balanced to feed the soil when it is discarded in the ground.

And, the superhero to head up that new profit center should be Brandon Foster.\nYesterday, when I started on the purchasing journey to get into a SMART car, I was the typical angst-ridden older shopper. You bet, I had had my share of lousy experiences with car dealers.\nBut I needed a car. For 26 months I had been conducting an interesting experiment: Could I really go carless? In my career coaching, I encourage financially strapped clients to ditch the car and do public transportation. Yet, despite my noble intentions, the combination of public transportation, Uber and bicycling just wasn't cutting it.\nOn the internet, I had spotted the perfect fit of SMART car. It was at a price I could do w/o a car note. Here is my story about 6-figure debt back in 2003. No longer do I buy anything on credit.\nThe problem was this: The SMART car was in MI. I am in Ohio, 44 miles away. No public transportation links. My social network is too stressed out to put the muscle on for a ride.\nNo problem for Foster.\nHe picked me up at my door in Toledo.\nThen, he was emotionally there in the passenger seat. I struggled to regain confidence in my driving skills, after not being on 4-wheels for more than 2 years.\nHe answered my sustained barrage of questions. In detail.\nHe even helped with the insurance company. He explained that I could search for perhaps a better fit of provider, once I had time to absorb being back in the driver's seat - pun intended.\nAt a bit before 3 P.M. I confidently pulled out the Fischer Honda parking lot in my powder-blue SMART car. Busy I-94? Got right on it. And, since I now had a car I was able to swing by a pet store far from my house and pick up treats for my four-legged son LOV. This Saturday, LOV and I will make the trip to Geneva on the Lake to watch the waves rolling on Lake Erie.

This type of mobile communication and collaboration improves patient outcomes while minimising disruptions for primary care physicians and hospital staff.\nMaximum efficiency and productivity translates to maximum profitability\nWhen radiologists are allowed to complete and pass along the many imaging reports they encounter each day with minimal interruption, distraction or delay, workflow is enhanced and profitability increase, always to the satisfaction of radiology managers, CFOs and CEOs.\nWhen imaging reports are sent to referring physcians without delay, everyone wins. Perhaps more important, minimising interruptions logically minimises physician errors, resulting in superior patient care and improved outcomes. Unfortunately, distractions remain very much a part of everyday life for many radiologists.\nHistorically, a major workflow impediment has been where the radiology reporting rooms receive calls, which interrupt the work of radiologists 90 percent of the time and may decrease reporting accuracy significantly, according to researchers. Each week, radiologists field scores of calls in reporting rooms everywhere.\nDr. Christopher Watura and his colleagues wrote in Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology that fewer than one in 10 inbound calls are deemed appropriate interruptions to the workflow of radiologists who must field them, often while in the midst of important and even potentially lifesaving clinical work.\nThere's another important interruption, however, one that is often overlooked: radiologists often must call referrers to notify them that a report has been completed. With each call comes a departure from work and the possibility that a radiologist will remain on hols until the referrer comes to the phone- and only if the clinician is reached and available. If they are not able to connect, it will mean yet another inbound return call to the radiologist.\nThe app's unique features include secure login with TouchID, a dynamic patient list that enables quick searches, extensive filtering (including modality and time filters), a convenient basic report view as well as an in-depth full report view, display of all key images in the study, and enhanced data security through deep linking. No PHI is stored on their mobile viewing device.\nThe app is first protected by the mobile phone user's passwords and fingerprints, and then protected further with a quick secuirty question just prior to opening your first study. After that, the server recognises that device as safe and the referring physcian can access studies with a simple swipe and a fingerprint scan.\nGetting started with AlertView\nRequired Software: Enterprise Nova RIS or reports Distribution Manager 8.6.7 (or higher) so that works with NovaPro and other sites.

Users log into the AlertView app, search for the patient, and view the report.\n", "final_result_str": "no", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "fbbec64d-617f-4e58-a155-fa8c868e60d9", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "正常的营销"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "fc0ad71b-f3c8-4a3d-b0cf-5a14d59e2be5", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "医疗报警软件推广"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "c1652d26-2c7b-461e-b04a-eb38df401755", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "产品介绍，有分隔"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "2c00c09b-0ceb-4de0-9580-59099719dc2a", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "将无关内容删减", "repair": "need_repair"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

The response was immense and provided the Council with insight not only on that subject.\nSome people questioned the Council’s place to ask such a question; others wondered why we would choose Facebook as a channel to engage with the profession. Some even wanted the Council to shut the conversation down. We want to respond to those comments and concerns and clarify some things.\nIn 2015 the Education Council came into being when the Teachers Council was disestablished under the Education Amendment Act. The Teachers Council had mainly regulatory and disciplinary functions, whereas the Education Council has a much broader statutory mandate with greatly increased professional functions, and, as a result, the scope has been substantially widened. Our mandate clearly states that our purpose includes leading public debate on education issues. We are the only professional organisation that represents the whole profession across the sector, which includes Māori-medium and ECE.\nThe broader mandate includes commissioning research, sharing best practice and developing programmes to strengthen leadership across the whole sector. To do that well we must have our ‘finger on the pulse’ and not only understand the issues and debates going on in the sector but lead the discussions with the profession so that there is an opportunity to share expertise and build the profession’s collective practice.\nThe decision made to ask such a question on Facebook, in hindsight, lacked judgement. And while the number of people who responded was greater than any other poll we have created – nearly 2k – it’s clear we got the method wrong. The question was never intended as a ‘survey’ to gain a deeper understanding, polls don’t have that ability; the way we consult with the profession is carried out with far more rigour than suggested by the poll. But without doubt, this is a subject that is clearly important to the profession, and we would be doing a disservice to end it here.\nSometimes getting a sense of the areas where more support or research would be useful can quickly be assessed by snap polls. The tools we are moving towards to better initiate research are coming to the Council with the move to an online platform that will create a safe, robust and professional environment, and even with those tools in place, we will, from time-to-time, continue to use polls when we think it is right.\nWe want to know what’s important to the teaching profession, even the controversial subjects because if we don’t ask the questions, we can’t provide the right resources to teachers and leaders.\nFacebook is an effective platform to engage in a somewhat non-formal way, and the question of privacy was raised. Concern for teachers’ privacy and data collection is considered by us, and in no way are we collecting the information gained via social media as a form of storing evidence to use against individuals. All future polls will include a disclaimer to make that obvious.\nShying away from controversial subjects will not be our space. Our recent Teaching Today podcast episode brought together a panel of experts to discuss the issue of physical restraint in an education setting, which resulted in lots of feedback from teachers and parents with differing views. Modern Learning Environments is also a critical subject that requires more input from the sector, and to keep that going our next podcast episode of Teaching Today will focus on this topic.\nBy all means, email us your comments and questions that you would like discussed on the podcast to letstalk@educationcouncil.org.nz and, if you think you would like to contribute in person, volunteer to take part on the podcast panel.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "6306318d-deb5-4372-8922-3a1a7d2db2ab", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 宣传文章，逻辑合理"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "0c23bb55-0f84-4397-861d-3523380f0438", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "逻辑清晰"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "7eae2b1e-bb05-4c99-8c44-c3bda131356e", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "公共教育社交媒体讨论"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "6d2e4e09-e736-4e27-a2ad-16d6c7ebff48", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "民意调查"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

I imply c'mon peeps. Older houses have particular items you just can not destroy and also, not just did the previous proprietors cover it up, the demo guys just sledge hammered a section.\nI wish to take a minute and also pay tribute to the flooring. I asked the individuals to take off the rest 1990's tiles with love as well as care so I could picture the initial tiles and also pay respect to the artisans who developed this home over 85 years back.

So I have this mini Aboriginal dress, and it looks pretty nice, and I wear this dress on Bondi Beach where anything goes and I can not tell you the energy of the people and the way people respond. Unbelievable. Bondi Beach, you know, anything goes there. I thought I was going to get beaten up! Twice I wore this dress. It was incredible. That was my own little experiment.\nI've been interested [in Indigenous issues] for probably about six years. [When] I went to school it was Captain Cook who discovered Australia. I read the Fatal Shore and then I remember [my daughter] did a school project and I rang up Aboriginal Affairs and they sent me out this information which I read and then became appalled and shocked. Horrified, mortified. And then I saw the exhibition and had the same response to the photographs, the people in chains. I must say I was aware of that but it really coalesced those images in the Fatal Shore - just to see those photographs. I really couldn't walk past, I read the information, but those photographs, those people in chains. And I remember trying to get the family to go through it to show them these things.\nI thought differently. I've met Aboriginal people ... the ones I have met ... didn't click with the way that, as a child, when you grew up and everything you heard [was negative] and then you see an exhibition like this, well then you see a lot more of the story...\nI think it gives you an added confidence.

Fuchsia is best planted straight into a boundary and being solid it will continue to blossom quite a long time after year. Most solid Fuchsia plants will develop into a fine shrub, a Fuchsia shrub is dealt with a lot of like some other shrub pruned approx mid to pre-summer, the more you leave the dead wood on top of the strong Fuchsia plant the better, pruning to right off the bat in the season might free the plant up to infections, in addition to in case there is a freezing snap the ice may very well enter the crown of the plant and kill the Fuchsia by and large, if the old wood is left on the plant it will assist with redirecting a portion of the ice away from the focal point of the crown.\nThe blossom size on these assortments is not huge however they will blossom for a long time of the year and are covered from head to foot with sprout, additionally these plants are so vivacious after just three years they will make an enormous Fuchsia fence in hotter pieces of the country.

Sorry for the delay – I think life just gets too busy sometimes! I am guessing that if you have crocheted (or have starting crocheting) your squares from Part 1 then there are loads of online tutorials that would show you so clearly how to join them – better than I ever could anyway!\nHowever, I am going to put my written instructions here for you because, if you are like me, it’s good to just read things sometimes, and you can also print them if you wish!\nYou may already know that I never intended to publish this design, it was in fact borne from just moving across the world with my family and I just needed a little comfort-crochet! I also had this beauty of a box from Scheepjes that I was yet to use – so the Mini Therapy Blanket started! I guess I ended up sharing this super simple design because A. you might be fairly new to crochet – and this is a great beginners pattern, B. you may have a Scheepjes box and are unsure what to do with it, or C. you also need a little calm crochet time…..\nSo, once you have decided on the layout of your squares you get begin to join them! Now, how I am doing this – I have re-arranged in my box the order that I would like my colors to go, then I crochet one or two squares, and join as i crochet the squares. BUT, you could could just as easily crochet all the colors and then lay them out and then join-as-you-go. The only thing with doing it this way is that it might be a bit fiddly to layout and then keep them in order – unless you have a spare bed to lay them on or similar.\n(just as a little note, I have kept the tail of leftover yarn from each square – once you break off the yarn just wrap it around the ball band as you can keep these for making yarn pegs or a little colour library)!\nMethod:\n1st Square; With MC join to any 1-ch space and continue with 3 tr, 1 ch in each 1 ch-sp, and working [3 tr, 2ch, 3 tr] into each 2-ch corner.

For example… 3 tr, 1 sl st into 1 ch-sp of adjoining square, 3 tr….\nWhen you reach the corner it can be a little trickier but the same principal applies…when you are joining to 1 square you will slip stitch into the corner 2 ch-sp of the meeting corner, then 1 ch, 3 tr to complete the corner…when you are joining to 2 or 3 squares, you need to slip stitch twice into the corner(s) instead of 2 chains, then continue with 3 tr to complete the corner.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "48806d56-d155-4f4c-8f65-e5397e974bca", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "- 逻辑：不明白", "repair": "no_repair"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "c73be945-864c-4fa8-8342-1e6b02742471", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "逻辑清晰"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "ef92bb3e-1283-436c-8ad4-4a7efbf32391", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "不知所云", "repair": "no_repair"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "8a40627a-1dfd-4629-8271-35bb39e854be", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "编制教程"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Yet here we are, I on my mountain top--one that is broad enough, however, that our cows are in no danger of being part of a landslide--and he, rebuilding a run down farm. Not his own, but he's planning buildings, studying fertilizers, going cautiously, challenging both brawn and wits, that these New England hills give back their best to us.\nIt seems like something I've always been waiting for, this country. From the moment I wound up the mountain to my home, the far awayness of everything, the sleepiness, made me wonder if this might not have been the original habitat of Old Rip, instead of the Catskills. If these New Englanders could go to Iowa, they might return and see their land with new eyes. Not that Iowa is not beautiful, with her broad black acres criss-crossed with baby corn as pie crust used to stripe my mother's cranberry pies; with young oats covering the earth like a velvet green carpet.\nYet the broad stern acres seem to challenge one. Here the land--not the people, for no people could be kindlier than Iowans--seem friendlier. Beauty is so riotous. It lures one away from work. It seems to say, \"Relax, we will take care of you--\"\nStill, how a living can be wrung from these rocks I have yet to learn. As I coast down the mountain these homes that crowd close to the pavement mystify me. I want to go inside, know the people. In Iowa I did not feel so about the homes I passed.

Here’s a different perspective on the matter.\nAs part of my second year in the technical theater class during seventh period, I help build sets and work on the less physically tasking aspects involved in a show, such as lights and sound.\nSome high school theater students across Orange County participate in a program called Cappies, which recruits youths from one Orange County campus to attend dramatic performances at another one and to write an evaluation of those shows, also known as critical reviews.\nSo as our tech crew read through Cappies reviews for last year’s musical, “Chicago,” we realized that the critics ignored most of the technical aspects in favor of appreciating the actors and dancers more.\nSince the reviews were read while discussions about the set for Sunny Hills’ theater production of the spring play, “Play On!” (May 15-18 in the PAC) were made, it was a perfect time for a bit of discussion.\nAnd so the ranting began.\n“They think it’s impressive for the show to be this great?” one of my theater tech classmate asks. “They should see all the hard work I put into making the show sound great.”\nAnother of my peers responds: “I don’t think they realize all the hours that we sacrificed after school to actually make the stage not look like an empty black spot.”\n“Those lights were a pain to hang up and adjust,” says another student from the technical theater class..\nAnd then my turn.\n“I wish there was a way to tell them that I sacrificed my sleep to make this set seem like an actual house,” I say. “Painting the cubes that the ensemble danced in took way too much time than I would’ve liked.\nYes, you read it right.\nFrom building the actual set to hanging up lights and to recording many sound cues, techs do almost everything that one can imagine.\nBuilding the set is always the first thing we do, and it involves using drills to screw pieces of wood together, cutting wood using a miter saw and painting.\nOne big obstacle in our path for “Play On!” was painting and glossing french doors that are average in size and pretty wide, which are very fragile and have lots of little nooks and crannies.\nAttaching them to the actual flat took a few days, such as making sure the doors were level with the ground and having to be careful so the wood didn’t split. Such a prop is a major component in making humorous scenes, such as an actor peeking through the slots and making sure the others don’t slack off.\nThen we spread out to our own respective jobs.\nAs opening night crawls closer and closer, we started to have tech Saturdays starting from May 5, which meant that we have to come to school and go to the PAC at 9 a.m. on Saturday and end close to 7 p.m. This last tech Saturday on May 12 went on until 9 p.m to make sure that both casts of the play went through the entire show without stopping.\nWe put finishing touches on the set and made changes to accomodate the actors, which usually just means moving set pieces back and forth many times to make them satisfied.\nIt’s pretty annoying because the original spot that the set piece was in is usually the final place that the directors decide on.\nTo allow more techs to have experience in different areas, I was next in line to learn all about sound.\nIt was a new experience for me, such as looking up the actual sound cues online and editing them in a software program called Audacity, which made me appreciate all the work my predecessor did even more.\nThen the week before the show came knocking on our door.\nAffectionately dubbed “hell week” by the techs, it is one of the most stressful times of the year with last-minute rehearsals and costume changes.\nStaying until 8 or 9 p.m. after school from May 7-11 really took a toll on me, especially when I had to finish homework and take a shower.\nYet I believe it pays off in the end to see a full house and the audience clap after the end of each song although techs don’t get to go on stage and take a bow until the last show because of a long-standing tradition.\nBut please. Remember how hard techs work their butts off backstage. Some words of praise and thanks are greatly appreciated. Even applauding when we come out and bow on the last night is great.\nSo don’t forget about us when you’re watching “Play On!” this week.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "9f841a8d-83da-4c39-822b-093a249a6444", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "：时间逻辑清晰"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "f4c43cc6-3a35-461a-8dd5-8764ed8b76c4", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 语句通顺"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "14e220c5-c625-492f-a3c4-192f0b5b9795", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "剧院和舞台技术主题"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "15f6ab94-bd4a-4067-b0f8-7d2035297fbe", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "演员排练布景相关"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

To resolve this situation, you slim the acrylic paint by including more than 30% water to it. Acrylic slowed down are made up of glycol additives, so acrylic paint ends up being workable until it is totally run out. When the acrylic paint dries up, it ends up being permanent as well as addition of water will not re-soluble.

Nonetheless, with respect to timber surface areas, due to the fact that it is permeable, it has to be keyed initially.\nIt works at advantage on a transparent surface. As opposed to using the standard paintbrush, explore past the bounds of painting by scattering or pouring the paint on one location and slope and pointer it on various instructions. Combine as lots of colors as feasible, however if you favor basic shades, do it in a couple of colors. It is possible to produce a reasonable photo making use of acrylic paints. The very best point to do to arrive at this reflection is to clean light paint into the surface. Because it is light, it develops a supple as well as elastic function. It will also expose the lower layers. For a watery texture, what has to be added is an adequate amount of water. The much less amount of water included, the thicker it will appear.\nWhile acrylic painting tends to avoid and also deject shade mixing, it nevertheless is the most irreversible paint. It cannot be subjected to any kind of staining up until after 50 years, contrary to various other kinds of painting. Being the latest paint selection, it is not restricted to the conventional mediums of painting. It invites other foreign things such as chalk or charcoal above as well as past the acrylic paint brush, in addition to sand, sequins, or pasta. However challenging is the application of paint, numerous artists favor its use due to its versatility. It could be used thickly for a solid exterior or in glazes to mimic an original sight. Other painting media can be utilized to add appearance, or adaptability of the acrylic paint. Instances of another tool made use of are varnishes as well as topcoats making the painting shiny and shiny. These paints could likewise be made use of in matte after coats.

We have ben running close to normal production since Sunday!\n-\n9 points\n*CURRENT Tracking Rules*\nBigDutyDiesel and 8 others reacted to cyberdman for a post in a topicI've done some house cleaning and consolidation and added in a few new items to take notice of. Please review the items below for changes / updates. 1.) I request that you subscribe to this thread if you haven't already. Click the little button at the top that says \"Watch topic\". That way I'll get no frantic responses from any of you that don't keep up with this and ask me a million requests when I am gone or on vacation that I have already said I won't be available. You will be automatically notified as long as you have your forum / board settings set up properly. 2.) There are a number of you that have come to this forum for only the purpose of tracking and have in a sense spammed the forums with silly banter in order to fluff up your post count to get in here and demand some tracking action. I would think that if tracking was that important, many of those of you would have read my rules and responded accordingly. I know how you feel ... it is just like Terms of Service agreements or software piracy acknowledgments - you know, those agreements in software programs that scroll on forever that those people ask you to read, but you don't and you just click \"agree\" anyway to get to quickly click on the next prompt. Humor me and read each and every rule. I ask for a reason and there are so many rule breakers I'm close to my wits end with a lot of you. The rules are here to assist me in helping you - that is it. 3.) If you break a rule, I am no longer going to give you a kind reminder. I am simply just going to ignore your request. If you find you are being ignored, then you did something wrong. Figure it out. Re-read the rules you were supposed to have read in the first place. Then, once you are ready to comply properly, you can re-bump your thread properly. I am not going to respond until you do. 4.) I am sorry, but some of you are taking extreme advantage of my generosity and this free service I offer on my own time. Those that do are ruining it for everyone else. From now on: Absolutely no more than ONE (1) update per tracking thread, per week. I don't care if you are in the process of shipping, or have started production. You plan it out when you want to hear from me, but no more than once per week. I don't care if your lease is expiring and you need to know tracking info so you aren't left without a vehicle. Get a clue - If you are to the point where you need to know where your vehicle is in production because you may/will be left without a vehicle to drive - you have definitely already screwed up and have extremely poor planning that even I can't help you with. 5.) All PMs asking about tracking, information or updates will be deleted no questions asked. I thought this was clear, but apparently it is not. I don't care if you can't figure out how to post in this forum. No PM's about tracking or updates, period! 6.) I am not ignoring you, but at the same time I am not baby sitting your vehicle tracking either. If you want an update, bump your thread. If I haven't gotten to it in a few days, please re-bump - it may have fallen off my list of new updated topics. 7.) If you start to become annoying by wanting timely minute-by-minute updates of any minor thing that happened during your production run or shipment - please stop posting and see your dealer. I am not a service, I do this in what little free time I have because I want to. Please don't make me not want to do this anymore. If you respect my free time, I'll respect your request - it is pretty simple. You don't own me and I don't have to respond. 8.) I have to be at work to do this and I'll typically handle most requests in the morning. Don't ask me for a weekend update because you won't get it. 9.) If I have previously given you an update and in that update there was a specific date listed of something to happen next in the production run, please don't ask me for any more updates until that date has passed. I waste a ton of time with folks wanting updates to production dates I have given you when that date hasn't even happened yet - there won't be any changes. Please be smart about it. 10.) I am not the plant, delivery system, production scheduler or your dealership. Don't ask me to estimate any type of dates or time frame for you, or why things are such and such or taking so long. I can't and won't. There are a million and one variables in what happens with your order - things take as long as they take. 11.) I provide vehicle locator updates - status updates that can be found in your vehicle visibility report. That is it. Don't ask me to provide you with anything other than that, i.e.: no build sheets, no window stickers, no production schedules, no rail car information, no rail car numbers, etc. 12.) Do not make multiple threads for updates. Stick to one thread per VIN / Dealer Code-Order Number for updates. You want to follow a second car you have ordered, make a new thread for that vehicle. Repeat, do not make multiple threads for the same vehicle - even if you've provided incorrect information the first time. Just correct your mis-information in an update to your thread. I will get sick of figuring out which one I need to respond to and just not respond to any of your threads. 13.) I am a human, not an internet robot. I appreciate civility and I enjoy pleases and thank yous. However, please keep the extra chitchat outside of tracking info to a minimum because it helps me sort through threads I haven't upated yet and ones I have. 14.) I do not want anything in return for this. However, after all this work for you, my only payoffs are, 1 - knowing you are happy, and 2 - seeing that final picture of the vehicle I helped you follow for weeks on end. Please don't forget the photo. I love that. 15.) I need a valid VIN, or dealer code and order number to track your order. Please quadruple check the numbers you provide me. I know they are a long string of numbers and letters, but reporting those numbers right the first time will makes us both happier. 16.) When you bump your threads looking for more info, please repost your VIN (or Dealer Codes and Order Number) within your bump. 17.) Do not come here looking for information if you don't have either a VIN or proper, correct Dealer Code AND Order Number. Don't try to give me a Dealer Code with your vehicle description and expect me to find your vehicle. In most cases it is a needle in a haystack. Without both - forget it. If you have your DORA, the Dealer Code and Order Number are both on there, do me a favor and give me both or forget it. Also know this, most dealerships order multiple vehicles -even different types, under the same Order Number, so I will need a description of your vehicle along with your Dealer Code AND Order Number - such as: type, engine, trans, body style, that is it. Don't give me packages or trim levels, those things don't mean squat to me and are not listed in the Visibility Report as trim levels, just a laundry list of options. 18.) I am only a minor admin on this sub-forum, I have no control over how it works and how you get here. I can organize threads and close topics, but I am mostly just a user like the rest of you. Forget all the conspiracy theories of what I am doing to you in why you can't post here or your threads disappearing or whatever related to how the forum works, it is just all B.S.. 19.) If I give you a status and it is Unscheduled-Clean, that means you have a successful order in the system and it isn't currently scheduled for production. When you are in Unscheduled-Clean status I will provide updates no sooner than every two weeks, providing you bump your thread properly. There are a multitude of reasons why something doesn't progress quickly from that status to the line. It has to do with production schedules, plant availability, ordering priority numbers, where you live and that region / dealerships specific allowed allocation segments for that vehicle. I have seen Unscheduled-Clean status stay that way for weeks and weeks on end - even as long as 6 months depending on the availability of what you are ordering and speed of the plant, etc. etc. If you are upset about your vehicle being Unscheduled-Clean for an extended period, you need to work with your salesperson to try to adjust your order priority or find out what period your allocation unit is limited to. 20.) Enjoy yourself. If these updates start making you angry or hostile, or your attitude is making me angry or hostile, please go elsewhere and blow off some steam. Thanks as always. Any comments will be deleted.\n-\n8 points\nEV Transition-Can Dealers handle it?\nChrisgb and 7 others reacted to ice-capades for a post in a topicFord has been setting rules for the newer vehicles (Mustang Mach-E, Bronco, etc.) regarding advertising, sales prices, retail order compliance, etc. and enforcing them via an audit program for compliance. Dealers have to report scheduled retail orders that are cancelled by the customer or be in violation of the program rules. Dealers can lose allocation, lose incremental allocation and even be charged back for incremental allocation granted previously depending on the severity of the Dealer's violations.

Minor quality issues dealership is fixing today and I’ll pick it up tonight. This truck was a big deal for me since my previous F350 was stolen while I was away from home working, right before Christmas, and I’ve been without my heavy work truck over a year now. The wait for it was difficult because I had to turn away work opportunities. I wanted the options I selected and would not compromise since it’s replacement for what I had. The big hold up was adaptive steering, 5th wheel prep and any number of other issues, but it’s over now and I can focus on setting this beauty up to get new work done.

It felt practically necessary – the only way context could be sufficiently established, that you could follow along with new developments. In the days before RSS – that is, only 5 years ago – you’d click through your list of links daily, just to discover if they’d posted something new.\nIt was all the better for the site to be one of the hand-crafted ones, where you knew that someone had to spend time creating the latest “entry” page by hand, updating the archives page. Those based on a dynamic updating platform had a curiously flat appearance to them, all “posts” the same in some respect or another… and yet there was an undeniable appeal, the simplicity of not having to upload, the ease of automatic archiving – and the brilliance of RSS, all for (practically) free.\nAll you had to do was learn the template.\nAnd then people (ok, at least I) got lazy. There were better designers out there, and they were giving away templates as they played with new layouts – CSS had arrived, and there was experimentation to be had. And then it got accessible – anyone could do it, technical skills or no.\nFor a time, it was good. People were experimenting, the format was evolving, and there was a whole net out there to be explored.\nAfter that time, it got staid. Everyone had a blog, a flickr account, a myspace page, and a facebook profile. And along came tumblr, tempting with its short-form updates. Youtube provided a diversion into video blogging, and the multifarious podcasting tools for those who preferred audio. And then came the prodigal son, twitter, life in bite-size chunks of 140 characters.\nNow, they’re all hungry, as the newly social internet runs on the back of that ubiquitous term, user-generated content. They ask you to Add a New Post, or What Are You Doing? or the latest prompt, What is On Your Mind?, as though the answers were being sought for anything other than page-views and the corresponding ad dollars.\nWhatever happened to us?\nSo it is thus that I’m prompted for a redesign, one I’m flagging ahead of time in order for it to sink in to myself. A re-organisation away from the blog format, one where we return to the idea of a “home page”.\nI no longer blog in the longer form about day-to-day things – I never had much to say, not being a diarist, and with the advent of twitter it entirely does away with the reason to post here for shorter items. The main thing I post here are the longer opinion/rant pieces, selected links I deem more interesting and noteworthy than simply appearing on del.icio.us, and finally reviews of movies, music, books etc.\nNone of these really make sense in a blog form – there’s no narrative continuity, no requirement for a timeline. The default archiving method has in effect fallen to being last-come first-served – and there’s no reason for it.\nMy most popular posts are the one where I detail the rules of the card game Sweep, and where I share a basic Indian recipe – neither of which is immediately obvious from the page you’re greeted with when you land on this site. It’s not that I want to particularly drive visitors towards these posts, but these are the ones that have become most useful to people, and there’s no reason Google should be the only “portal” in to my site.\nThus it falls to a redesign – as I mentioned, a re-ordering of how things work. Rather than allowing time to dictate the ordering and visibility of items, I’m going for a home page that returns more to the original use of the term. I’ll still utilise the tools available to me in the background, so RSS feeds, comments and the like should remain, but at first glance, things should feel a little more… hand-crafted.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "ae0894f0-aa3b-42ad-9da7-1b96f4fc54aa", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "：个人随笔记录"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "697e5dab-7dc1-4dfc-93b1-e3042cdf52ad", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 博客文章，语义通顺"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "b99eaf60-094d-41a0-b9ca-301f2ddd3b1c", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "主题为关于互联网发表内容的博客"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "a72b4769-7a75-492d-8842-6d891de383cd", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "怎么写帖子介绍"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

It sounds happy as well as makes you happy, but have you ever considered how humans have become so fond of music throughout history and in every culture around the world? No, because we don’t really need to. All we want to do is to enjoy and groove to it. Well, quite relatable fact though, but sometimes we need to exchange thoughts on something good for the sake of knowledge enrichment. Knowledge of anything only helps.\nSo, music does create a big impact over life, health and happiness. Practically thinking, it helps you forget a hard day at work, relationship disputes, financial loss, and ill-health to name a few. But, there are a few more interesting benefits of music what we have never tried to know about before. Here they are:\nMusic helps in verbal and visual learning\nStudies show that interactive music training helps children of ages 5 to 12 to understand things faster and better than those who are not taking part in the experiment. They tend to understand the meaning of any new word much clearly and explain it in a smarter way than others. The students also got to work on their IQ level and it developed at a quicker than usual pace. Music seemingly helped children boost their brain-power and improve their verbal and visual skills.\nThis happens because they have to go through a variety of intellectual lyrics, understand the function of rhythm, diverse usage of pitch and voice. It’s been shown that continuous musical training makes a child sharp and rational.\nMusic heals an ageing brain\nAs a person grows older and finally reaches his golden years of life, means becomes a sexagenarian or septuagenarian, the rate of his brain’s reflexes then starts dropping. He feels unable to focus on everything he wants and work on that. Here, music helps them retain their brain reflexes and feel like young once again. When a person puts himself to music, he then has to concentrate on so many things simultaneously. Right from lyrics to instrumental incorporation and even the context of the whole song. You must be aware of the fact that each song tells you a story and the listener feels obliged to understand it to feel the real essence of the song. In an attempt to what this song has to tell about, an ageing brain too starts retaining its reflexes.\nThe door to happiness passes is through music\nNeedless to say, music heals your dead nerves and gets them functioning once again. The instrumental beats and the lyrical substance take the listener to another level and help him think of only happy things. May be, this is why, today, everywhere the “installation of music” has become sort of essential. For example, DJs for corporate events and parties, wedding DJs, DJs for birthday parties and so on. Music helps a party get energized and be memorable. Regardless you are happy or sad, music only helps you cheer up for a little longer. You love its instrumental collaboration and do not want to pull out anymore.\nMusic has a good effect on your heart, blood pressure and pulse rate\nWe listen to music with our muscles. – Friedrich Nietzsche\nTrue 101%. We feel it and then we can feel the positive change in us. Music does impact our emotions, psychological as well as brain effects. It also saves you from becoming the prey of depression!\nHave you ever noticed that every person has different taste in music? Did you ever try to understand why this happens? Why do not you like the song your best friend goes mad over? You do not like all the songs available in market, you choose a few and then tend to gravitate towards a few niche genres. This happens because not all types of music can feed your brain with endorphins, which is known to add to vascular health, but a few can. Also, some studies, which have been conducted lately said that patients, who had survived cardiac attacks, did not seem anxious or feel the pain after listening to a moderate number of tracks after the attack. It appaers that music also impacts your blood pressure and pulse rate.\nSleep without music does not sound good\nGenerally, when you go to bed and light goes out, all you get to see is how hard the day was and subsequently become anxious about tomorrow as well. This kills your sleep bugs. Here music helps you keep any sort of anxiety away. Just put the ear buds into your ears and play the most favorite song you have always loved listening to and see how fast you fall asleep.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "38966fcb-cdda-48ec-9e38-8725f186cbe0", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "主题鲜明"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "48fd45ac-0391-46c5-98ec-178af41f4402", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 描述音乐的内容，语义通顺"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "f998cf00-29b5-4919-8834-675fe7876ce2", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "音乐相关内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "2e902990-c495-4ff3-a1c1-ab5bdd1e6d06", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "音乐相关"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

He wipes out everyone wo tries to get the story out — I mean, they’re all narcs so other than him being a murderous scientist with a steampunk looking visor I’m on his side — but then he decides to kill our heroine and her boyfriend by letting a snake loose in her flat.\nTo escape, the two must use a bunch of paper cups and a string — shout out to Pepsi Max getting some free publicity, I’ve been drinking that stuff so much for so long most of my body is made from it to communicate like kids in a treehouse. It was at this point that I just gave in and watched this, amazed that it was ever made, that it made it to Tubi and that it was now be watched an ocean and years away in my basement.\nWe’ve made an incredible world and it’s so trivial.\n*He has a modeling page and she has an Instagram though!\nYou can watch this on Tubi.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "dc0f147b-88c6-4bf8-aee7-49602d5b4026", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "影评"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "07091dde-cf59-4f22-8ada-60e083512f92", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 电影介绍，通顺"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "44f58656-e7f0-460b-b283-cf2297fb1940", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "介绍一个电影"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "889e3223-c664-4ae8-9170-2b745ad27383", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "影评"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

He tried the TV but nothing good was on. He made his bed and was sure not to eat too much of their food or leave a mess. He walked on egg shells to ensure that he was a decent house guest. His uncle was gone to work all week and his aunt had many social events with the local ladies that she went out to. Most of the time he was there, it was just him an 50 acres. The animals were a little scary so he stayed away from them. The geese would nip at you, the dog would nip at you, the cows could crush you and the chickens would peck you, Nolan didn’t like any of the animals.\nHe would also dream strange dreams at night. They were different here from most places. The colors and the lighting looked different, the stories were all scrambled nonsense. It was just about the most boring place he had ever been. He loved that! No one was anywhere. When the animals would leave him alone he could finally have some time to be truly alone. Being alone was his favorite thing. He didn’t watch anything or read anything all week. He was so happy that everyone was gone all day. It was just him and 50 acres, listening to the wind and letting the sun shine on him. It made him feel free and alive!\nAt night his aunt would make home cooked meals. A little piece of fresh farm chicken, a couple of home canned vegetables, and a couple of from scratch rolls were on each plate every night. It was so simple, healthy and delicious. Then they would watch the news together and his aunt and uncle would ask Nolan questions about it. They were so impressed with his ability to talk about current events and to understand them. It was the only thing about him that impressed them so he tried not to mess it up by saying anything too crazy.\nNolan had to downplay what he knew for most people, even smart people. They couldn’t handle seeing life through his eyes, it could break them. He always noticed when he said something that was over the heads of an intelligent adult, they had so many questions but couldn’t ask them. They couldn’t organize the thoughts to get to the thing they didn’t know. Most would just shut down right there before their brain broke. Sometimes they would get mad or attempt to intimidate Nolan down from his position. But he wasn’t wrong, they just didn’t know all that stuff.\nHis conversations his dad and Mr. DJ taught him a lot of things that other people didn’t know. Maybe this was the thing his dad taught him. He couldn’t tie a knot and he had to learn to through a ball from another kid, just like most of the things he had learned in life; but Nolan knew business, news, politics, and current events. He understood things that most people never would. Nolan didn’t give much thought to this being a skill or a talent but he could weave a 360 degree understanding of current events into his head until it became predictive. It all seemed simple to him, to know the direction things were moving and what was coming next. He wasn’t that smart so he assumed that everyone could do that. The most fun he had that week other than being alone, was talking about the news.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "aa11f918-65de-48e7-84f2-220b8784bf48", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "网页：小说片段"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "32ea8699-2094-44cf-afeb-2640ed16b0fd", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 生活记录，有逻辑性"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "23701521-207f-4405-90fa-204aa79b321a", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "有逻辑文本"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "18e7c4d3-46c8-4541-902e-590ca8ed7bf9", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "日记"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

For example, if ice accumulates on an engine inlet of an aircraft gas turbine engine, such as on a leading edge or lip of the engine inlet, such ice accumulation may disturb airflow and affect aerodynamic performance. Moreover, ice pieces may break off and enter the engine, resulting in possible damage to the engine.\nKnown aircraft engine anti-icing (EAI) assemblies, systems and methods exist. Such known EAI devices, systems and methods may involve transporting hot air or hot gases from the engine's compressor, e.g., engine compressor bleed air, to the engine inlet to provide thermal anti-icing to the engine inlet to prevent ice accumulation. In addition, such known aircraft EAI devices, systems and methods may involve the use and installation of a complex assembly of structures, for example, link structures to support the supply ducts and/or seals to prevent leakage of the supply ducts.\nHowever, the use and installation of such known link structures to support the supply ducts may involve increased labor, time, and complexity to assemble and install. This may, in turn, result in increased manufacturing costs. In addition, such link structures may require the use of numerous installation and assembly attachments, such as fasteners, brackets or other attachment elements, which may add weight to the aircraft. Such increased weight may, in turn, impose a performance penalty with respect to the aircraft, i.e., increased aircraft fuel consumption.\nMoreover, known seals used to prevent leakage of the supply ducts may include the use of silicone based seals, silicone/metallic seals, and elastomeric seals, as well as carbon seals. However, such known silicone based seals, silicone/metallic seals, and elastomeric seals may not be able to tolerate the very high temperatures, i.e., about 800 degrees Fahrenheit, or greater, that may be required for the supply duct, the engine inlet, and surrounding parts. In addition, such known silicone based seals, silicone/metallic seals, and elastomeric seals may have limited wear resistance, may require time consuming maintenance and inspection procedures to be performed after installation and use, and may be difficult to install if only blind installation, i.e., by feel alone, is available. Further, known carbon seals may be expensive, which, in turn, may result in increased manufacturing costs.\nAccordingly, there is a need in the art for improved aircraft engine anti-icing (EAI) barrier assemblies, systems and methods for air vehicles such as aircraft.\n\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "4e2fee8e-10ac-4d4f-a531-9a892b62c332", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "发明专利内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "2f242a44-e84a-4f4b-b417-ffa21f4dc4ee", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "专利"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "7eaa39b6-55b2-48d5-aec0-59f6f3c337e0", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "1. 语句通顺\n2. 语法错误13"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "73353f0a-0010-4b51-8b83-7e9cb25e68f7", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 技术知识内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Technical Field\nThe present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a thin film device using an inter-substrate transfer technology for the thin film device.\n2. Related Art\nIn semiconductor application devices such as liquid crystal display devices (LCD) or electroluminescence (EL) display devices, plastic substrates are sometimes used preferably as base substrates for the reason of preventing breakdown caused by deformation or dropping impacts, flexibility, or demands for weight saving. However, since the plastic substrates do not have enough heat resistance for a high temperature process required for manufacturing semiconductor devices, it is impossible to form semiconductor devices on the plastic substrates by an ordinary manufacturing process.\nAs a technology for forming a semiconductor device on a plastic substrate, a transfer technology has been proposed, in which a semiconductor application device is manufactured by attaching an element-forming layer (a layer to be transferred, hereinafter referred to as a transfer layer), which has a thin film semiconductor device formed therein and is detached from a heat resistive transfer-source substrate, to a plastic substrate, the transfer-target substrate after forming the thin film semiconductor device on the transfer-source substrate. Such a transfer technology is described as “a peeling method” or the like in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications No. 10-125929, No. 10-125930, and No. 10-125931 in detail.\nHowever, electro-optic instruments or electronic instruments in recent years are required to be packaged in high-density and low profiled, and accordingly, the thin film devices manufactured using the transfer technology described above are also required to be packaged in high-density without increasing thickness.\n\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "4e68abd9-3af9-4133-b09f-adb5faeab09c", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "1. 膜设备制造方法的内容\n2 语句通顺，5个语法错误"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "2c640b64-d91f-480b-8796-027ed249c9af", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "专利内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "435e6518-0a29-4895-854d-93d756286532", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "通顺的专利介绍"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "e3aaddd5-697d-4af4-a905-4f1ec379fa43", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 知识性内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Honesty and truth don’t really mean as much to everyone as it does to each individual person, yet all the bullshit in life can fertilize. Insignificant or insatiable, words can piggyback on feelings, and a second glance is just as significant for another chance, or even an eye roll. We grow and change into different people we expect to be, and there’s hardly a person aside from who we use to be that can say, “you aren’t who I expected to be.” Whether we met expectations or bet expectations, the biggest disappointment is the appointment kept when time’s are harry, and no bigger bow to where you came from. Ask yourself, “are you ready?” as a joke and see if you give a laugh or take a deep breath first.

I spent 2 months sleeping. I went to bed at 7pm. I’d wake up close to noon, maybe later. I had migranes, never had migranes before. I got them from sleeping. Everybody loves talking about sleep.\nWhen I was out of bed i rode a bicycle. I rebuilt it, speedy red color. I cycled because I needed a reason to get out of bed because of migraines from sleep. I didn’t cycle far, my muscles were getting used to it. I’d be at the pond writing, just so i could spend time somewhere other than in my bed. I tried to get home by bedtime. Aside from suicide this was the best I could disappear from the world.\nbut eggs. white, brown, organic or not don’t matter. Skillet, Spatula, eggs, skillet, and some milk.\nWhisk eggs with milk\npour the eggs into the HOT skillet slowly scrambling simultaneously. It cooks the eggs faster.\nGive the eggs a little brownness from the oil\nand the milk will have made the eggs really fluffy\nTry green onions next time if you liked it. Taking the time to cook a couple of eggs in the morning is my advice to anyone that wanted to try rebuilding their life again. middle-aged, down on cash and don’t have any friends you can think of calling… get the eggs, asshole! We gotta fix you, fast!\nTake the time and care to cook some really good looking eggs and then cleaning up before you eat. And that’s how you’re going to rebuild your ship, sailor. Remembering to tidy up the loose things on and around your world, you’d look like you were dancing and fixing your life.\nBecause I know that world you’re left in, sitting on a plastic lawn chair after turning down suicide. My first thought with the hammer in my hand was, “well, i just spared my own life.” I didn’t know what I was going to do with the hammer anyway. But how do you use a second chance like that. Probably retrieve all the notes. And cook a couple of eggs. I call ’em Pardon Eggs.\nSkip Everyday\nWhen I passed away the first time, I cashed in my chips of chaos for structure. No room for messes I couldn’t manage, straight lines only. However, one can never shed the roots from which they’ve come to fruition, so the chaos lingers. So I kept my chaos at bay with perpendicular angles and tectonic shifts, mentally and actually.\nThey say you can read a person by how they keep their room, and it’s true. From a room of acute and oblique, and laundry as carpet, I went to a Swiffered linoleum, and cubic IKEA shelves. Within those shelves, were where my micromanaged chaos lived. Juxtaposed eccentricity and ethereality, I thought it would maintain the structure in my life. But one can never anticipate the unpredictability of others.\nThe man who took me in and gave me a chance with a job I’ve only dreamed of, allowing me to pursue and collect the wonders of life that waited in single file, took his own life. He did so with taste, a Smith and Wesson Model 29, .44 Magnum. Dirty Harry’s gun. His head, cleanly taken off, and off with him, the stability he gave me. I haven’t had too much experience, with death, or maybe I have and repressed it’s memory. Wait, yeah I did, a close friend had died of hypothermia and blood-loss in New York City two years earlier, but I don’t think that counts. Okay, I’m bad with death.\nThis man helped mentor me into writing, and gave me a job under him, as his head editor. Now that he selfishly took his own life because of a divorce that robbed him of his children, I’m selfishly wondering about what job I can find next. Only a week has passed since the incident, yet, it is only a matter of time before the skyscraper of stability I’ve gained in my life, comes toppling over, leaving a rubble’d gravesite I can call my own.\nIt still wasn’t as bad as the first time I died, when my heart was wrung dry and kept in an oblivious girl’s dresser, but now I’ve no body, no heart, and what’s left of my soul isn’t strong enough to power to the flashlight I need to light my way.\nI can’t talk to anyone about it either, because I’m too stubborn to listen to their words. I’ve always found my therapy to be writing, especially in the state of despair. Though, lately, I’ve been finding myself writing things that sound like suicide notes. Not because I’ll soon run out of funds, some of the richest people are often the saddest people, but because nothing in this earth feels like it grips me to it anymore. We sometimes forget to show love to the things we love, and thus, are never prepared to show them to the exit.\nThe things in life we love, help us live; being without those things, help us leave.\nFiled under non-fiction rambling, stories\nJack Kurtilick Holds Rare Maltese Anfibidorian Hostage\n“…and some things in life hint to the fact everyone was meant to unequivocally suffer in due time. We all feel liberated by the sight of the ocean, though we can not live in it. We die, then return to whence we came. I may drink like a bastard now, but I’d like to call it training! How old are you? 18, 19? Breathing underwater seemed a bit more advantageous in opposition of knowing how to swim,” then Jack looked at me, sharpening his once roundish eyes,”are you sure you don’t want a drink, Daniel?”\n“I’m alright, thanks.”\n“There’s no shame in it, provided your laxed provisionally minimal, adherent regards towards Christian propaganda.” said Jack, pouring himself another scotch, straight. I paused for a moment because I had absolutely no idea what this drunk fucker was talking about. After gathering what was left of my mind, I understood his power; he spoke in jargon, like a doctor. No person has any fucking idea what the doctor is talking about, but the way they spoke allowed you to nod your head, accept, and receive a terminal death sentence. That’s how Jack spoke, though it could also be the half empty bottle of scotch on his end-table.\n“I’m really just here for, Eleanor. The Maltese Anfibidoria or whatever the thing is called… the, ‘FISH,'” I gestured quotations with my fingers, “means a great deal to her.” I couldn’t look Jack in his eyes. I mean, I’d want to kill me too, if my ex-girlfriend sent a younger, adept replacement to retrieve a prized, rare fish at our old apartment. I, then, glanced up as a fluke due to the absence of a response and locked onto his eyes, and to my surprise, only saw the eyes of an man misplaced from another world. Donning the eyes of, what seemed like, a passionate player who’d lost a chess match. Defeated by a kid with beginner’s luck. Hand on his glass, he peered closer. Then withdrew. Then spoke.\n“The ‘FISH,’ is in the back, Danny boy.” Jack said a he pointed towards another end of the apartment.\nAfter a moment, I spoke. “Thanks, Jack.” I started what must have seemed like the most awkward exit. As I was about to round the corner, Jack spoke.\n“Daniel,” I turned and faced him, “little Danny Smolensk knows where to go, if he were to change his mind about that drink right?”\n“Yeah… Danny S. knows.” I nodded and gave a half-assed non-military salute, about faced. I hadn’t known at the time that I would never see Jack again. He was to vanish on a fishing excursion. Jack really wasn’t a bad guy. I liked him.\nFiled under stories\nquickstopshopptopcyclops\nDaniel, then, questioned the possible outcomes his situation had harnessed. He thought about all his school chums of the past. Kenny was a successful drug dealer with no aims or aspirations to conquer anything besides making rent on time. Alan was simultaneously the premiere floral and compost adviser in the garden section of a Hall-mart, and Kenny’s number one customer. Marcus had a career as a high school nurse. He received a prestigious education, a prestigious degree, from a prestigious school, and now, at most, with vigor, applies band-aids and prescribes sleep in the nurses’ examination bed for an entire class period. He does so with undefinably prestigious passion. Even Daniel’s first high school girlfriend Kimberly, (which took place during Senior Prom, only) became a police officer and an internet wholesaler of unnecessary (ninja) equipment, and homemade jewelry. During high school, Kim tried out for both the cheerleading squad and the football team and stole a spot in one of those. She still, and has never never held a pom-pom. Daniel thought, all the things you could been could be found in the town you never had the intention of naturally dying in. The yearn for a meaning or a greater purpose in the world, only meant and amounted to how persuasive your excuses were.\nDaniel stood brooding in the pick a cart, any cart section of the market lobby, brooding over the accomplishments people he knew had made, and decided he could get over his silly inclination to drink, and accomplish the goal. Daniel changed the ringtone on his cellphone to one that would encourage him, as he placed the Alcoholics Anonymous pamphlet into an unused shopping cart. “Baby steps, baby. That’s how accomplishments happen,” Daniel thought, “how pathetic would I look if I couldn’t fulfill the only goal I’ve ever wanted to accomplish?” Bells were not rung, not a single toast was made, and not a facetious soul cheered or tackled.\nThe cart he unknowingly claimed with a pamphlet had a wheel that steered slightly to the left, but angled the cart sideways to compensate the piece of crap. “It’s no trouble,” he thought, “There! Now I’ve conquered this bitch.” And that’s when his cellphone went off. Confused at first, Daniel then realized the improbability of anyone else with “Paranoid Android,” (by Radiohead) as a ringtone was strong, despite his intention of having “No Suprises” instead. He reached for his phone in his back right pocket, brought it up to his face, and saw digits to a phone number calling. The number wasn’t saved among his contacts so it only showed up at a number with a vaguely familiar area code. “Hello?” Daniel asked, with one hand holding the cart at course-compensating angle.\n“I knew it was you, I saw you in the parking lot,” pause. “I can’t believe you still have the same number! It’s been like, ten years!” said the male voice in a dizzyingly enthusiastic manner.\n“Yeah, my lucky set of numbers. They’ve always reached to me, in a way.” Daniel said dryly as he looked at the different sauces that were meant to change the way the fish tasted. Daniel believed everyone he ever knew were like fish with many kinds of sauces lathered on them which was meant to suppress much of the distaste they initially came with. He placed the sauce jar back on the rack. Daniel was always a black coffee, salt and pepper, on-the-rocks, kind of guy. He thought, “if some fucker took seven measly minutes to ponder then invent these things, how rude would I be to suggest they should’ve done this or that, instead? That’s like telling the bartender you liked his idea for a drink, respected the faith he had in it’s glory, and then telling him not to quit his “day job,” as you slowly finished his drink.\n“Haha, you’re funny! I was afraid what they said was true about you Hollywood types; you say what the writers say, and laugh when a casting director has something you want,” said the voice, “and plus the drugs and booze therapy that EVERYONE ELSE has to pay for.”\n“I haven’t gotten to the drugs yet, but, the year doesn’t end for another six months.” said Daniel, after realizing he, and the world lurked in the birth-month of the first and only love he’d ever had.\n“Yeah sure, what are you getting in there? Better be some fuckin’ sour cream and onion potato chips. I’m coming in to make sure.” After realizing the caller’s identity,\n“Son of a bitch, I don’t believe it. Kenny? Is that you?”\n“Yeah, baby! If you’re not in the Chips section, I’m gonna fuck your mom. How’s she doing?”\n“Good question.”\n“Sorry, I forgot. Come say hi and hold hold my hand, faggot.”\n“That’s rude, even for you.”\n“I said I forgot!” Kenny pleaded. “Sorry!”\n“No, the other thing.”\n“Oh. What, you went fag in Hollywood?” Kenny used fag in his daily repertoire, despite it’s context, though he did have shining qualities. He despised animal abuse so much as to not wear leather. Like a vegan. Kenny had no problem eating them.\n“No.” Daniel couldn’t stand arguing with him over political corrections. They never ended, though each of Kenny’s points became less and less sensible. The problem with it, Daniel thought, was that Kenny believed every word he said.\n“Whoooooa there, Mr. Hollywood, I’m just kidding. It’s fine if you’re a fag.”\n“Things don’t change around here, do they?” Daniel said as he placed a bag of sour cream and onion chips on top of the twelve pack of the cheapest beer he found, which was on top of the Alcoholics Anonymous pamphlet. Drinking was like a camera lens filter, blocking or accenting the malicious and unnecessary elements of the immediate world for the photograph. Daniel drank to filter out the idiocracies and hopelessness of life.\n“What? Everything’s changed, man. Hey, I see you.” They hung up. Daniel looked around and found Kenny. He was wearing fitted jeans, dark blue running sneakers, a plain white T-shirt, and his football Letterman from high school. Outside the new lip-ring, Kenny dressed like Kenny.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "34f0e357-3de9-473e-8ea4-bf2d8c706690", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "聚合性文学创作，过于抽象"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "8c470bfa-5f4b-41ca-ad21-f57897b5561a", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "作品合集，有故事有诗歌"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "f83a36be-f591-4db3-aee3-374fd0f21f1c", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "- 逻辑：句子之间的逻辑性牵强，不好理解。"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "d949631e-dcfa-404a-a66b-ed601ec3e506", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "内容不健康"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates generally to a system to increase the communication and sensing capabilities of a surface craft. More particularly, this invention relates to sensor and communications equipments carried in a balloon tethered to a surface craft to increase line-of-sight sensing and communication.\n2. Description of the Prior Art\nLine-of-sight (LOS) communications are being used to provide secure high-speed transfers of data to-support tactical operations. Currently, only satellites are capable of supporting LOS communications and transfer of data over the considerable distances where ships, aircraft, and submarines are typically separated during anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations. However, satellite communications are expensive, limited by channel availability, require large antennas for two-way communications (found only on ships having large decks), and cannot always be as flexible as required to meet the changes that frequently, rapidly develop during ASW operations.\nAircraft that drop sonobuoys to listen for submarines must then orbit high in the sky to monitor them and receive their LOS data. The high orbiting of the aircraft prevents them from flying low where they are more likely to detect a submarine visually or though the use of radar, MAD, or FLIR which work better at low altitudes. Another factor to consider is that the number of aircraft and ships for ASW is decreasing so that each ship/aircraft is forced to cover larger areas of search. Consequently, they may miss some of the LOS data, and this potential constraint places additional stress on personnel to effectively coordinate and share the gathered data to find submarines that are becoming even quieter.\nCurrently, there is a limitation of the amount of improvement that can be obtained through improving the location or size of the antenna/sensor packages to increase detection/reception ranges. In addition, many antenna/sensor packages may have their capabilities restricted to one degree or another and may not be able to perform their functions effectively by being placed on a ship where LOS may be compromised by electromagnetic interference, and other competition from other on-board systems. Size, location, and weight of some antennas may affect the ship\"\"s stability (roll), delectability, and the amount of power that may be available to a system without impacting other systems, and some active and passive countermeasures may interfere with the operation of other shipboard systems. Loading a ship with sensors and communications packages may actually create a further problem since hostile cruise missiles may home in on these packages. Since an effective defense against cruise missiles is to draw attacking cruise missiles away from a ship, it may be better to locate the packages the missiles home onto someplace else besides on the ship.\nThus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art for a system including a balloon towed behind a moving ship that supports appropriate instrumentation packages overhead to improve line-of-sight sensing and communication capabilities.\nThe first object of the invention is to provide an improvement for surface craft, or ships to improve their line-of-sight sensing and communication capabilities.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a system including a balloon tethered to and towed by a ship to support sensors and/or communications equipment to improve their LOS (line-of-sight) capabilities.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a towed airborne array system providing improved performance of sensor and communications equipments with ships, submarines, and aircraft operating in larger areas.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a towed airborne array system improving the performance of existing sensors and communications equipments.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a system for monitoring sonobuoys from a surface ship to free ASW aircraft from orbiting and monitoring duties.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a system for monitoring sonobuoys from a surface ship and/or unmanned, autonomous buoys to free ASW aircraft from orbiting and monitoring duties.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a towed airborne array system that increases flexibility to use power and transmission bands for communications.\nStill another object of the invention is to provide a towed airborne array system that permits less reliance on satellites and provides twenty-four hour improved capabilities in line-of-sight communications and data sensing.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a towed airborne array system that increases capabilities for mine detection and countermeasures performance.\nThese and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.\nAccordingly, the present invention provides a towed airborne array system including a balloon towed behind a moving surface ship that supports appropriate instrumentation packages overhead to improve line-of-sight sensing and communications.\n\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "8a8030b9-595b-4560-9c46-94797400da86", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "1. google没搜到；\n2.

I was so taken back at everyone’s selflessness, kind, and thoughtful gifts. We had so much fun opening up all of our wonderful gifts, then taking them back to Seth’s and looking at them all again, making a huge stack and shutting the door behind us, then Seth had to returned back to school. Someday soon we will be able to organize all of our neat gadgets into a home soon! I just cant wait to begin using all of our fun stuff and cooking for Seth!\nThank you to all of you that joined us on Sunday! We are so appreciative of your gifts and we can’t wait to celebrate with you on July 12th!\nSkip forward to this weekend…We spent our Friday night chilling on the couch dancing and picking out wedding music. I think we have some pretty unique, not heard yet at a wedding, music going on! I’m very excited to meet with our DJ in June, especially after winning ProShowDJ from South Bend, that was a huge blessing! Then today and tonight we pulled out all of our wedding decor and sat and organized it all. I really hope that everyone will look at every detail. I’m sure some will, and also some will never know the amount of time and effort that was put into each piece.

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of die cast thin-walled details of metal and a device in a mold adapted thereto.\n2. Description of Known Technology\nDie cast metal parts are commonly used today. These are used in many different areas where there are high demands for low weight, function and precision. Details obtained through ingot casting need to be extensively processed after casting to achieve the desired precision. Such details also need fairly thick goods to ensure complete filling of the mold cavity since no pressure can be applied. The latter increases the weight of finished work piece weight which is not desirable. Also inner volumes of articles intended to have a certain capacity is reduced. Injection molding of for example aluminum makes it possible to utilize so called rheo-casting which provides higher homogeneity and reduced risk of forming pores in the molded goods. Injection molding of aluminum is performed in the temperature range 670-720° C. High pressures are used to produce thin-walled parts in particular when utilizing rheo-casting. This implies that high demands on the sealing planes in the mold as the melt has low viscosity and easily creeps into the partition plan. Traditionally, it has therefore been considered impossible to design injection molded details with collapsing core as this would greatly reduce the life expectancy of the mold.\nOne way known in the art is to utilize separate cores for providing undercuts. These separate cores are assembled into the mold prior to molding and is after the molding pried or knocked out of the molded part. There are several problems with this known method.\nFirst of all, the molded part will shrink onto the separate core and the release angle will therefore have to be rather large, typically in excess of 5°. This will of course limit the practical use of making undercuts.\nSecondly the cycle time will increase as the mold will have to be assembled before each molding.\nThirdly the separate cores will be damaged due to all the handling especially when the separate cores are knocked out of the molded part. This will affect the sealing of the mold and consequently limit the useful life of the mold itself.\nFourth, the mold temperature is very important for the quality of the molded detail and there is no practical way to temper the separate cores prior to, as well as during the molding cycle.\nFifth, the use of separate cores will also increase the need for post molding treatment as the inevitable dents on sensitive edges of the separate cores, which are intended to form sealing planes in the mold will cause so called burrs and flash.\nSixth, the knocking and prying operation to remove the separate cores from the molded part will increase the risk for damaging not only the separate core but also the part itself. Small cracks or fissures not unlike those related to as metal fatigue can occur which leads to a need for substantial testing of molded parts with serious functions such as certain critical vehicle components.\nSeventh, the separate cores need to be fixed in their proper position during the molding which calls for one or more support pins arranged at the opposite side of the mold. These support pins will leave holes in the molded part and these holes will in most cases have to be plugged after molding.\nEight, all of the above listed problems will inevitably lead to a substantial cost increase for the molded articles due to increased handling, longer cycle times, shorter life expectancy of the molds, increased amount of rejected articles, lower average quality of molded parts, increased testing to assure quality and finally increased work effort on each molded part.\n\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "39471726-74bf-4204-bc5a-7362713f55fe", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "通顺的发明专利"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "4ab33579-83b5-4d8a-bbc5-59abcb712be6", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "专利"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "3b93286d-5e08-4e98-9516-9b11e6322a71", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "1. 语法错误23\n2 发明专利"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "10bdddd2-1496-47a0-8695-7b77afd9ac1e", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 知识性内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

INTRODUCTION My concern in this paper is the relationship between faith and rationality. I seek to develop a unified account of statements of faith concerning mundane matters and those concerning religious faith. To do so, I consider the sense in which faith requires going beyond the evidence, and argue that faith requires terminating the search for further evidence. Having established this, I turn to the question of whether it can still be rational to have faith; arguing that, contrary to common assumptions, there need be no conflict between faith and rationality. We shall see that whether faith can be practically rational depends both on whether there are extrinsic costs associated with postponing the decision to have faith and the extent to which potential counter evidence would be conclusive. II. PRELIMINARIES I begin with the idea that faith statements in religious contexts and in more mundane contexts express the same attitude and so share some typical characteristics. By 'faith statements' I simply mean statements involving the term 'faith'. The following are representative examples: I have faith in your abilities. He has faith that his spouse won't cheat on him. I have faith in you. He has faith that you won't reveal his secret. She acted on faith. She has faith that her car will start. It was an act of faith. I have faith that God exists. I have faith in God's goodness. I have faith in God. 1 Forthcoming in Philosophy of Religion: An Anthology, 7th edition, eds. Louis P. Pojman and Michael Rea, Wadsworth. Reprinted from L. Buchak (2012) 'Can it be Rational to Have Faith?', Chapter 12 of Probability in the Philosophy of Religion, Oxford University Press, 225-247. Discussion has been edited to simplify and make accessible the primary mathematical results. 2 These statements share three important features: they involve a relationship between the agent and a particular proposition, between the agent and a particular (actual or potential) action, and between the proposition and the evidence the agent currently possesses. The first thing to notice is that faith statements typically involve a proposition to which the actor involved acquiesces. This is obvious in the case of 'faith that' statements: when a person has faith that p, he acquiesces to p.2 It is also clear in the case of those statements that can be easily translated into 'faith that' statements: for example, the statement I have faith in your abilities is equivalent to I have faith that you will be able to do such-andsuch. It is less obvious in the case of those statements claiming that an individual has faith in a person; however, upon further inspection, having faith in a person does typically require acquiescing to particular propositions about that person. For example, having faith in a person might involve acquiescing to the claim that the person will do the right thing or will succeed at a task, and having faith in God might involve acquiescing to (at least) the claims that God exists and that God is good. By the same token, performing an act of faith or acting on faith seems to involve acquiescing to a proposition, and which proposition one acquiesces to will be set by the context. For example, if setting down one's own weapons is an act of faith, then this is because setting down one's own weapons involves acquiescing to the claim that the other person will then set down his. The second thing to notice about faith statements is that the truth or falsity of the proposition(s) involved is ordinarily a matter of importance to the actor. For example, it does not seem apt to state that I have faith that the Nile is the longest river in Egypt, because I do not care whether or not this is true. We do not attribute faith to a person unless the truth or falsity of the proposition involved makes a difference to that person. I might consider whether to have faith that my spouse won't cheat on me or that my car will start precisely because it makes a difference to me whether or not these things are true. Along the same lines, having faith typically involves an action: a person's having faith in something should make a difference to her behaviour. However, this needn't be an 2 I speak of acquiescing to a proposition rather than believing it because I am not sure that if I have faith in something, I thereby believe it. While it sounds infelicitous to say 'I believe that ~X but I have faith that X', there may not be anything wrong with saying 'I don't know whether X-I have no idea whether I believe that X or not-but I have faith that X'. So as not to prejudge that issue, I make a weaker claim: that having faith involves taking the proposition to be true, that is, 'going along with it', but not necessarily adopting an attitude we might describe as belief. 3 actual action. It would be enough for faith that if a person were put in a particular situation, she would then manifest the relevant behaviour (assuming that there are no forces that would stop her). Faith is thus linked to a disposition to act. This brings us to the next point about the relationship between faith and behaviour: it seems that one can have faith in a particular proposition relative to one action but not to another. For example, I might have faith that my car will start when I only need to drive to work but lack that faith when I am relied upon to carry a life-saving organ to the hospital (as evidenced by the fact that I may double-check my engine or arrange for a backup mode of transportation in the latter case but not the former). A person might have faith in God when it comes to giving weekly donations to the poor but lack faith in God when it comes to allowing himself to be martyred. There are two ways in which we might interpret the fact that one might have faith when it comes to the performance of some actions but not others: we might say that faith is context-dependent, or we might say that faith comes in degrees. There is something to be said in favour of each of these approaches. However, whether one has faith that X, expressed by a particular act A, will be determinate on either approach, and since this will be our basic unit of analysis in this paper, we needn't choose between them. The next thing to bring into the picture is the relationship between the agent who has faith that X (expressed by some act A) and the evidence he has for X. We make assertions of faith only when the outcome of the proposition involved is uncertain or when the evidence we have is inconclusive. For example, when a friend is worried about the outcome of an exam, we might reassure her by saying 'I have faith that you passed'; however, once she shows us that she got an A we would no longer say this. Clearly, this is not because we are less willing to acquiesce to the claim that she passed, but because we now know for certain that she did. For similar reasons, it seems odd to claim to have faith in logical truths. These considerations suggest that a person cannot have faith in propositions of which he is antecedently certain or for which he has conclusive evidence.3 Are there further 3 Although the following worry arises from the possibility of over-determination. I might have faith in my friend, and therefore have faith that my friend hasn't transformed me into a brain in a vat for his own merriment (this example is due to an anonymous referee), and yet I might be antecedently certain that I'm not a brain in a vat (on the basis of philosophical arguments, perhaps). Or I might have complete faith in a friend's testimony, and thus have faith in anything he says; however, it might be that he sometimes says things of which I am already certain. What should we say in these cases? One 4 restrictions on which propositions a person can have faith in? I don't believe so. Indeed, a person may have no evidence at all for the proposition he has faith in, or even may have evidence that tells against the proposition. For example, we could imagine someone saying 'Although she's spilled all the secrets I've told her so far, I have faith that this time will be different', or 'I don't think there's any evidence that God exists, but I have faith that he does'. Therefore, that a person has faith that X implies nothing about his evidence for X, aside from its inconclusiveness. Statements in which the actor has faith despite no or contrary evidence do seem correctly described as cases of faith, even though they are not cases in which we are inclined to think that the actor is wise to have faith; rather, we think his faith is misplaced. We will later see that we can do justice to the distinction between well-placed faith and misplaced faith. My final preliminary observation is that having faith seems to involve going beyond the evidence in some way. The bulk of my argument will be devoted to spelling out in what way one must go beyond the evidence in order to count as having faith. I postpone discussion of this to the next section. We can now begin to give a formal analysis of faith. As we've seen, the term 'faith' appears in many different grammatical constructions: you might have faith in a person, you might have faith in a proposition, you might perform an act of faith, or you might act on faith. We require an account that makes sense of all of these uses of the term. I've already pointed out that faith typically involves a proposition as well as an action to which the truth or falsity of the proposition makes a difference. I propose, then, to make faith that X, expressed by A the basic unit of analysis, where X is a proposition and A is an act, and define the other constructions in terms of this one. It is important that our analysis express the relationship between the proposition and the act. I have explained that a person can have faith that X only if he cares whether X is true or false, and presumably this is because the act of faith constitutes taking a risk on X. What is possible response is to say that a friend's testimony simply can't produce faith in propositions of which I am already certain. After all, we may think it sounds strange to say I am independently convinced that I can't be a brain in a vat, and I also have faith that you haven't envatted me. Another possibility is to claim that these statements, to the extent that we can imagine circumstances in which they could be uttered felicitously, are really modal in character: the actor is claiming that if she wasn't independently convinced that she wasn't a brain in a vat, she would have faith that you haven't envatted her. 5 it for an act to constitute taking a risk on a proposition? We can say that doing A constitutes an individual's taking a risk on X just in case there is some alternative available act B such that A is preferred to B on the supposition that X holds and B is preferred to A on the supposition that ~X holds. For example, telling my friend a secret constitutes taking a risk that she will keep it because on the supposition that she will keep it, I would rather tell her, but on the supposition that she won't keep it, I would rather not tell her. Whether an act constitutes a risk on X will of course be relative to the individual performing the act. So, as a first pass, we might say: A person has faith that X, expressed by A, only if that person performs act A and performing A constitutes taking a risk on X. This is not yet the whole story, but it does allow us to go a step further and identify what it is to have faith in a person, and to perform an act of faith: A person P has faith in another person Q if and only if there is some act A and some proposition(s) X that express(es) a positive judgment about Q such that P has faith that X, expressed by A. 4 So, Bob might have faith in Mary because he has faith that Mary won't reveal a secret he tells her, expressed by the act of telling her his secret. Paul might have faith in God because he has faith that God exists and that God is good, expressed by the act of praying. Again, faith only requires a disposition to choose particular acts, and these acts need not be actually available. We can now take the next step and identify what it is to perform an act of faith, or to act on faith: 4 Notice that the judgment must be positive from the point of view of the agent, in the sense that the agent has a preference for A on the supposition that X, otherwise the account would be subject to the following counterexample: we think that if a person prefers that his friend refrain from smoking, even though he thinks his friend is inclined to smoke, he can't appropriately be said to have faith that she will smoke. 6 A person performs an act of faith (or acts on faith) if and only if he performs some act A such that there is a proposition X in which he has faith, expressed by A. With these preliminaries in place, the rest of this paper will elaborate what else faith that X, expressed by A, requires and under what circumstances it is rational to have such faith. III. GOING BEYOND THE EVIDENCE: THREE VIEWS Before outlining my own view I consider three initially promising ways to make sense of the requirement that faith goes beyond the evidence. I conclude that each of these attempts fails to reveal a genuine requirement of faith. First, however, let me briefly say something about the philosophical framework in which I am working. One way to talk about belief states is as \"on\" or \"off\": you either believe something or you fail to believe it (this could be because you actively disbelieve it or because you withhold judgment from it). But notice that of the many things you believe, you are more confident of some than others; furthermore, of the many things you fail to believe, you take some to nonetheless be more likely than others. As evidence of these facts, we could ask you how much you are willing to bet on various propositions: in general, you will be willing to bet more (accept lower odds) on the ones in which you are more confident. To capture these facts, many philosophers have found it helpful to talk about belief states in a \"graded\" way: beliefs come in degrees (sometimes called 'credences' or 'subjective probabilities') between 0 and 1, and degrees of belief should behave like probabilities. For example, if you assign a degree of belief 0.7 to the claim that the Giants will win the World Series (p(GIANTS) = 0.7), then you should assign degree of belief 0.3 to the claim that the Giants won't win the World Series. As we will see later, degrees of belief underlie a formal theory of rational decision-making, but for now we can just notice that choosing an action is like taking a bet whose outcome is determined by the state of the world. For example, when one assigns p(RAIN) = 0.6 and p(NOT-RAIN) = 0.4, and one leaves the house without one's umbrella, one is taking a bet that involves a 60% chance of getting wet and a 40% chance of staying dry. With this framework in mind, let us consider some attempts to analyse the way in which faith goes beyond the evidence. The first analysis claims that faith in X requires 7 believing X to a higher degree than one thinks the evidence warrants.5 More precisely, for an agent to have faith that X, he must think that the evidence warrants believing X to some degree, say, r, but he nonetheless believes X to degree q, where q is greater than r. More particularly, one might think that faith requires believing X to degree 1 (being certain or fully confident that X), even though one thinks that the evidence warrants a definite credence less than this. On this analysis, having faith involves being entrenched in a kind of partial belief version of Moore's paradox: one thinks something like X is likely to degree r, but I believe X to degree q. Ignoring the issue of whether this could ever be rational-since we don't want to prejudge the issue by assuming there must be cases of rational faith-there are two problems with taking this to be a requirement of faith. First, it seems hard to imagine someone actually having faith in this sense and, especially, recognizing that he has faith in this sense. Yet having faith seems to be a common occurrence, one that does not involve psychological tricks or self-deception. Second, because it unclear that one can reliably or stably have faith in this sense, or even take steps to set oneself up to have faith in this sense, it does not seem to be the kind of thing that ethics would require. And yet, religious ethics and the ethics of friendship do seem to require faith in certain cases. The second analysis is more initially plausible. According to this, for the person who thinks that the evidence warrants believing X to degree r, faith requires acting as if he has degree of belief q-that is, performing the actions that he would perform if he had degree of belief q-where q is greater than r. For example, one would take the bets that would be rational to take if one had degree of belief r. Thus, one can maintain a degree of belief in r- and so avoid epistemic inconsistency-while still behaving, as regards the likelihood of X, in a way that goes beyond the evidence. Again, more particularly, we might think that faith requires acting as if you have credence 1, that is, using p(X) = 1 when making decisions. This would amount to acting as if one is certain that X: not considering or caring about states of the world in which ~X holds when making decisions. I admit that this analysis has some plausibility. However, I again think that there are problems concerning both the phenomenology and ethics of faith. 5 In some of the analyses under review here the act does not figure into the proposal. Therefore, for readability, I will say 'faith that X' or 'faith in X' when I really mean 'faith that X expressed by A, for some particular A'. 8 The phenomenological worry is that, on this analysis, faith requires simultaneously keeping track of two things: one's actual credences, and the 'faith-adjusted' credences that one employs in decision making. However, the phenomenology of faith doesn't seem to involve a lot of mental accounting. Yet perhaps this is not a serious problem, because the defender of this view could argue that since faith is relative to particular acts, one only needs to consider one's faith-adjusted credences when making the relevant decision. There are two more serious problems arising from the fact that although religious ethics and the ethics of friendship endorse faith in many situations, they wouldn't endorse certain demands that this analysis suggests. First, consider what this analysis recommends that a faithful person do when asked whether he believes that X. Since this is an action, presumably the faithful person ought, if he ought to have faith, to figure out what to do using his faith-adjusted credences, not his actual ones. So he ought to claim to believe X more strongly than he does; that is, he ought to lie. But those that endorse faith often strongly denounce lying. The second problem is brought to the fore when we consider the particular view that faith requires acting as if p(X) = 1. On this view, the faithful person ought to take any bet that is favourable on the condition that X obtains, regardless of the stakes. So, if asked to bet $1m on a gamble that pays 1 penny if X obtains, the person with faith in X ought to say yes: after all, he can disregard the possibility of ~X for the purposes of decision making. I'm extremely doubtful that religious ethics would endorse the claim that the truly faithful ought to risk $1m for a mere penny if God exists, especially since they recognize that the evidence isn't conclusive.6 So we can dismiss the first two analyses which held that in order for a person to count as having faith that X, he must treat his credence in X as higher than it in fact is, either by actually raising it or by acting as if it were higher. Perhaps these analyses have gone astray because they took for granted an inadequate account of when faith enters into one's belief formation process. They both assume that one examines all of the evidence dispassionately, forms a belief, and then decides whether to adjust this belief in light of faith. But perhaps the 6 Perhaps the defender of the second analysis could claim that his view doesn't entail an affirmative answer because betting itself, when the payoffs are so frivolous, has an inherent disutility. But it is not clear that he can respond in this way to the case in which the 'payoffs' are goods of real value, e.g., in the gamble that results in a million lives lost if God doesn't exist and one life improved mildly if God does exist. 9 relationship between faith and belief formation is more complex than this assumption recognizes. Instead, faith might require taking evidence into account in a particular way-a way that favours X or gives the truth of X the benefit of the doubt, so to speak. Following this line of thought, a third analysis of faith holds that faith requires setting one's degree of belief to p(X) = 1 prior to examining the evidence. On this view, one interprets evidence, not with an eye towards finding out whether or not X holds, but in light of the assumption that X does hold. On this view, we might say that faith goes before the evidence, not beyond it. Note that this third analysis is different from the 'special cases' of the first two analyses. On those analyses, the faithful individual sets p(X) = 1 (either in his beliefs or for his actions) even though he believes that the evidence warrants something less. On the present analysis the agent doesn't have an opinion about what the evidence warrants that is separate from the question of whether he has faith. So let's say that I have faith that my friend won't reveal a secret I told him, and I overhear a third party complaining that my friend is a gossip. On the first analysis, I consider this to be evidence against the claim that my friend will keep my secret, but I nonetheless ignore it and continue to have a high degree of belief in the claim. On the second analysis, I consider this to be evidence against the claim, and I lower my degree of belief in the claim, but I nonetheless continue to act as if I have a high degree of belief (I carry on as if no one knows my secret, and I continue to confide in this friend). On the analysis we are now considering, I don't consider this to be evidence against the claim, precisely because I have faith in the claim. Indeed, there will be no possible evidence that tells against X. This third analysis has a number of advantages. For one, it sheds light on the fact that there seems to be no good answer to the question of how a rational person ought to set his credences before encountering any evidence. On this view, the reason that there is no good answer is that epistemic rationality stops just short of this question and faith takes over: one can't avoid having faith in something, because one can't avoid setting one's initial credences.7 This vindicates William James' claim that one's non-rational or 'passional' nature must determine what to believe when reason alone doesn't dictate an answer, and that the passional nature generally comes into play in figuring out how to interpret evidence (see James 1896). It also supports an insight of Søren Kierkegaard's pseudonymous Johannes 7 Technically, one could avoid having complete faith in anything, since one could avoid setting p(X) = 1 for all X. However, if we think that degrees of faith correspond to setting lower initial credences, then one would have some degree of faith in many things. 10 Climacus that reason alone cannot produce faith; instead, faith requires an act of will (see Kierkegaard 1846). Roughly, Climacus argues that one can never get to religious faith by engaging in objective inquiry because religious faith requires total commitment to particular historical claims. Objective inquiry can never yield certainty in these matters: it always leaves room for doubt. On Robert Adam's interpretation of Kierkegaard, total commitment to a belief requires a commitment not to revise it in the future (see Adams 1976). Thus, it requires setting p(X) = 1 and interpreting any new evidence in light of this. However, despite its attractiveness, this view is incorrect because it is vulnerable to similar phenomenological and ethical objections to the ones discussed above. Adams himself raises the ethical objection: 'It has commonly been thought to be an important part of religious ethics that one ought to be humble, teachable, open to correction, new inspiration, and growth of insight, even (and perhaps especially) in important religious beliefs' (Adams 1976: 233). We might add that the ethics involved in friendship similarly do not seem to require that we remain determined not to abandon our belief in a friend's trustworthiness come what may. The phenomenological objection can be bought out by considering that anyone who is acting on faith typically feels like she is taking a risk of some sort. The act A that you are performing on faith (that X) is supposed to be better than some alternative if X holds and worse than that alternative if X does not hold. But if one is certain that X holds, then doing A is not a risk at all. On the contrary, A is simply an act that, from your point of view, will undoubtedly turn out well. It is like the act of taking a bet on which you win $100 if water is H2O and lose $100 if it is not. One might reply that from an objective standpoint, doing A is a risk-because setting one's initial credences is risky in some sense. But even if that is the case, the view still fails to explain the phenomenology of acts of faith, since they feel risky even from an internal perspective. What is distinctive about taking a leap of faith, so to speak, is that you are fully aware that it might turn out badly-even if you think that it is unlikely that it will. An additional objection to this third analysis is that it cannot distinguish between cases of well-placed faith and cases of misplaced faith. Recall the above example of the person who knows that her friend has spilled all of her secrets so far but who has faith that he will not spill future secrets. We likely regard this as a case of misplaced faith. At any rate, when we compare this person to the person whose friend has never spilled a secret and who has faith that he will not spill future secrets, we think that this second person's faith has a lot more in its favour. But we cannot make sense of this on the present view, since rationality has 11 no conclusions about which initial credences are laudable and since faith enters the picture before any evidence is interpreted. So, although this third analysis was initially promising, it does not ultimately succeed. On my view, whether someone has faith is not determinable from the credences he brings to the table before examining evidence: a person who starts out sceptical, but who then amasses evidence in favour of X, could indeed end up choosing to have faith that X (consider the conversion of St Paul). Furthermore, a person who begins by assuming that X must be true doesn't thereby count as having faith that X: credulity and faith come apart. So do credence and faith, as we will see in the next section. IV. FAITH AND EXAMINING FURTHER EVIDENCE There is something to Kierkegaard's idea that one can never arrive at faith by engaging in empirical inquiry-that faith instead requires an act of will. However, this is not because faith requires a kind of certainty that empirical inquiry cannot provide, nor because faith must precede inquiry. Instead, it is because engaging in an inquiry itself constitutes a lack of faith. That is, faith requires not engaging in an inquiry whose only purpose is to figure out the truth of the proposition one purportedly has faith in. So the sense in which faith in X requires some response to the evidence aside from that normally warranted by epistemic norms is that it requires a decision to stop searching for additional evidence and to perform the act one would perform on the supposition that X. Consider an example. If a man has faith that his spouse isn't cheating, this seems to rule out his hiring a private investigator, opening her mail, or even striking up a conversation with her boss to check that she really was working late last night-that is, it rules out conducting an inquiry to verify that his spouse isn't cheating. If he does any of these things, then she can rightfully complain that he didn't have faith in her, even if she realizes that, given his evidence, he should not assign degree of belief 1 to her constancy. Similarly, if I have faith that my friend will keep a secret, this seems to rule out asking a third party whether he thinks that friend is trustworthy. To use a religious example, when so-called 'doubting' Thomas asks to put his hand in Jesus' side to verify that he has been resurrected in the flesh, this is supposed to indicate that he lacks faith. We can say something even stronger: faith seems to require not looking for further evidence even if one knows that the evidence is readily available. For example, consider a case in which a man simply stumbles across an envelope which he knows contains evidence 12 that will either vindicate his wife's constancy or suggest that she has been cheating. He seems to display a lack of faith in her constancy if he opens it and to display faith in her constancy if he does not. And this seems true even if the evidence has been acquired in a scrupulous way: we might imagine the wife herself presents the envelope to the man, as a test of his faith.8 So we now have the following first pass at a full analysis of faith: A person has faith that X, expressed by A, if and only if that person performs act A, and performing A constitutes taking a risk on X; and the person refrains from gathering further evidence to determine the truth or falsity of X, or would refrain, if further evidence were available. This formulation has an unfortunate upshot, though: it implies that anyone who has faith that X, expressed by some act A, must decline evidence in the matter of X even if he wants the evidence for purposes other than deciding between the available acts. For example, consider the Christian apologist who has faith that Jesus was resurrected (expressed by, say, the action of going to church every week) but who combs through the historical evidence surrounding Jesus' resurrection in the hopes of finding evidence to convince someone who does not believe. Or consider the person who intends to open the private investigator's envelope publicly precisely to show that he has faith in his spouse's constancy.9 On the current analysis, neither of these acts can be acts of faith: indeed, performing them entails that the agent does not have faith in the proposition in question. The reason that we would say that the apologist has faith in the resurrection even though he continues to look for evidence is that he doesn't consider his decision to attend church dependent on the outcome of his investigation. Indeed, if he had no desire to convince other people, he would not look for evidence. Similarly, the reason we know that the husband has faith in his spouse, expressed by, say, the action of remaining constant himself, is that his constancy doesn't depend on the contents of the envelope, even though it does depend on his (current) beliefs about whether his spouse is cheating. So what these examples show is that the claim that the faithful person does not look for evidence at all is too strong. Instead, the 8 Indeed, my account can easily explain why presenting him with the envelope could be a test of faith: it is a test to see whether he will choose to acquire further evidence. 9 Thanks to Sherrilyn Roush for this example. 13 faithful person does not look for evidence for the purposes of deciding whether to do A. Thus, if he does look for evidence, he considers this search irrelevant to his decision to do A. A precise way to spell out that the act doesn't depend on the evidence is that the faithful agent is willing to commit to A before viewing any additional evidence in the matter of X; indeed, he wants to commit to A. In preference terms, he prefers to commit to A before viewing any additional evidence rather than to first view additional evidence and then decide whether to do A. This covers both the case of the person who looks for no additional evidence and the person who does look for evidence, but not in order to decide whether to do A. We can now formulate my final analysis: A person has faith that X, expressed by A, if and only if that person performs act A, and performing A constitutes taking a risk on X; and the person prefers {to commit to A before he examines additional evidence} rather than {to postpone his decision about A until he examines additional evidence}.10 As mentioned above, my analysis vindicates part of Kierkegaard's insight that faith does require total commitment, and that looking for evidence reveals that one is not totally committed. But what one must commit to is an act, not a belief: specifically, one must commit to performing an act regardless of what the evidence reveals. My analysis also vindicates the idea that faith requires an act of will-on my account one consciously chooses not to look for more evidence (even though doing so might be tempting!)-which is difficult to explain if faith requires a certain degree of belief and belief is not directly under one's volitional control. One upshot of my analysis is that it is possible for two people to have the same evidence, have the same probability function, value the possible outcomes in the same way, and perform the same act, and yet one of these acts displays faith while the other doesn't. So, for example, assume Ann and Erin have the same evidence about Dan's secret-keeping ability; that both have p(Dan will keep a secret) = 0.9; and that both have the same utility 10 I formulate this condition in terms of preference because the theory of practical rationality that forms the basis of the discussion in the rest of this paper concerns preferences rather than choices. I note, however, that if the reader finds it more natural to formulate this condition in terms of a disposition to choose to commit to A, rather than formulating it in terms of a preference to commit to A, that is acceptable. (In any case, preference is strongly linked to a disposition to choose.) 14 functions (that is, the stakes are the same for both of them). Now assume that each has a choice whether to ask a third party what he thinks about Dan's secret-keeping ability before deciding whether to tell Dan her secret. Ann decides to simply tell her secret; Erin decides to ask the third party, and then ends up telling her secret to Dan on the advice of this third party. Here, Ann displays faith that Dan will keep a secret (expressed by the act of revealing her own secret), whereas Erin does not display faith, even though she also performs this act. So the same act in the same circumstances can be done with or without faith. The argument so far has told us nothing about the circumstances, if indeed there are any, in which faith can be rational. I now turn to this question. First I briefly explain the distinction between epistemic rationality and practical rationality, beginning with the former. V. EPISTEMIC AND PRACTICAL RATIONALITY I will assume a broadly evidentialist conception of epistemic rationality: one should proportion one's beliefs to one's evidence. One should not, for example, simply believe what one likes or believe what would make one happy. More generally, one should not take nontruth-conducive reasons as reasons for belief. I will also make some fairly standard assumptions about degrees of belief: degrees of belief obey the probability calculus; one updates one's beliefs by conditionalizing on new evidence; and two people can (rationally) have different degrees of belief in a proposition if and only if they have different evidence that bears on that proposition, or they believe the same evidence bears on that proposition differently, or they have different initial degrees of belief. An important upshot of these assumptions is that a rational person can only change his degrees of belief in response to evidence-and, in fact, must update them in response to new evidence, at least in matters he cares enough about to form beliefs. Epistemic rationality concerns believing what the evidence suggests. Practical rationality, on the other hand, concerns selecting the means to achieve one's ends. An informal way to characterize practical rationality is that it consists in taking the means to one's ends. And just as philosophers use a formal theory (probability theory) to characterize epistemic rationality more precisely, so too do they use a formal theory to characterize instrumental rationality more precisely: decision theory. Recall the earlier point that an action is essentially a gamble in which the state of the world determines which outcome you get. We already know that we can represent the likelihood you assign to various states – and thus the likelihood that an act will lead to each particular outcome – by a degree 15 of belief function. According to decision theory, we can also represent how much you value particular outcomes by a 'utility' function.11 On the standard view, subjective expected utility (EU) theory, rational agents maximize expected utility: they prefer the act with the highest mathematical expectation of utility, relative to their utility and credence functions. Here 'mathematical expectation' just means a weighted average: the value of each outcome is weighted by the likelihood of getting that outcome, and the resultant values are summed. So, for example, if p(RAIN) = 0.6 and p(NOT-RAIN) = 0.4, and if u(getting wet) = -3 and u(staying dry) = 2, then EU(don't bring umbrella) = 0.6(-3) + 0.4(2) = -1. If EU(bring umbrella) = u(carrying around an umbrella) > -1, then a rational decision-maker will bring her umbrella. In my view, EU theory is too restrictive. However, since this is the widely accepted view, and since I agree that expected utility maximizers are practically rational (I merely hold that there are other ways to be rational as well), I will postpone discussion of an alternative view to section IX. Before turning to the question of whether faith can be rational, it is worth clearing up a worry: that the definitions of rationality that I've adopted might not be strong enough. On the present definition of epistemic rationality, one may adopt any degrees of belief, including any degrees of belief concerning the relationship between particular hypotheses and particular pieces of evidence, as long as one's degrees of belief cohere with each other. For example, a person may rationally believe he has been abducted by aliens, as long as he also believes that the evidence he has supports this to the degree that he believes it. A similar point holds about preferences in the case of practical rationality. Both epistemic rationality and practical rationality, as I define them here, are notions of consistency: the only restriction on degrees of belief is that they are consistent with one another, and the only restriction on preferences is that they are consistent with one another, given one's degrees of belief in each possible state of the world. However, there is another notion of rationality, which rules out believing one has been abducted by aliens and rules out certain preferences, which we might call reasonableness. I cannot fully respond to this worry in depth here. But it is important that the consistency notion of rationality and the reasonableness notion come apart quite readily. Consistency restrictions are structural: they rule out particular patterns of belief or desire, regardless of the content of these attitudes. On the other hand, reasonableness restrictions are 11 On the debate between realism and functionalism about the utility function, see J. Dreier (1996). 16 substantial: they rule out particular beliefs or desires, regardless of which other beliefs or desires one has. Therefore, we can talk about what they require separately, and this project is about the requirements of rationality in the consistency sense. Or, since this sense of rationality exhausts the subjective sense of rationality, this project addresses the question of whether it can ever be rational given the agent's own attitudes to have faith. If we want to answer the further question of whether it is reasonable to have faith-that is, of whether a person has objective reasons to have faith-we can address this separately. Indeed, nothing in my argument relies on the content of the propositions believed or desired. Hence the question of whether faith is reasonable can be answered by asking whether there are any contents for which it is reasonable to have the patterns of belief and desire presented in my examples. Finally, I want to be clear that I am not assuming here that there are any benefits to believing false propositions, or to holding certain beliefs regardless of whether they are true. In my analysis, I assume that knowing the truth in the matter of X is always beneficial to the agent who is making a decision based on X: it allows her to choose the action that in fact turns out better for her. VI. PRACTICAL RATIONALITY AND EVIDENCE-GATHERING It should be clear that on the first two analyses of faith, considered in section III, above, faith is irrational. On the first analysis, which requires the agent's credences to be higher than those the evidence suggests, faith is epistemically irrational, and on the second analysis, which requires the agent to act as if his beliefs are different than they are (that is, to take something other than his credences as 'what he believes' for the purposes of decision making), faith is practically irrational, however we spell out practical rationality. On the third analysis, faith is always rational, provided one has consistent credences and preferences (though one can't, for example, have faith in two contradictory propositions). On my analysis faith can also be epistemically rational: that one has faith in X implies nothing about one's degrees of belief or the consistency thereof.12 Therefore, one can clearly meet the requirements of epistemic rationality, as I've stated them, while having faith- 12 Technically, it implies that p(X) ≠ 1, but if p(X) = 1 then X is not an appropriate object of faith, so this is not a restriction on one's credences, but on what can count as an object of faith. 17 whether one has faith is completely separate from whether one is epistemically rational because it is separate from whether one has appropriately evaluated the evidence one has.13 But can faith also be practically rational? Faith requires two actions: choosing A rather than the alternatives and not looking for further evidence for the purposes of this choice (or committing to A before seeing further evidence rather than seeing further evidence before deciding). Therefore, faith can only be practically rational if both of these actions are practically rational. Assessing the rationality of the first action is fairly straightforward: choosing A rather than the alternatives is rational just in case A has a higher expected utility than the alternatives, given the agent's credences. So the first (fairly obvious) restriction on when faith is rational is this: one's credence in X must be sufficiently high as to make A the practically rational act. What about the second action? Can it be rational to committo A rather than seeing more evidence before deciding? To address this question, it will help to have a canonical example of the kinds of situations in which the question of faith arises. Again, these situations involve an agent performing an act A in a situation in which the status of some proposition X is in question, and in which there is an alternative B such that he prefers A to B on the supposition that X, and B to A on the supposition that ~X. Let us simplify by assuming that A and B are the only two alternatives, and that B is such that its value does not depend on X, that is, the outcome of B is not affected by whether X holds.14 To put some concrete utility values in place: u(A&X) = 10 u(B&X) = 1 u(A&~X) = 0 u(B&~X) = 1 13 Even if epistemic rationality requires that one look for further evidence, it will not conflict with faith on my definition, since having faith doesn't forbid one from looking for evidence; it only dictates that one must commit to an act before seeing more evidence to postponing the decision. 14 We can represent this by stating that the individual is indifferent between B&X and B&~X. What if X is something that the agent strongly prefers to be true, so that A&X and B&X both have a high utility? One might think, for example, that faith in God is typically like this, since the agent often prefers worlds in which God exists to worlds in which God does not exist, regardless of the agent's choices. As it turns out, the assumption that the agent is indifferent between B&X and B&~X is not crucial to the results discussed here: see Buchak (2012) for details. 18 We could generalize by assuming there is a high value, a middle value, and a low value such that u(A&X) = H, u(B&X) = u(B&~X) = M, u(A&~X) = L, and H > M > L. In other words: A performed when X holds yields the best outcome, A performed when ~X holds yields the worst outcome, and B performed either way yields an intermediate outcome. Here are some examples of decisions that might include the relevant values. Consider an individual who is deciding whether to become a monk and does not have conclusive evidence that God exists. If God exists, then becoming a monk is very good-the individual will experience all the goods of the religious life. But if God does not exist, then becoming a monk will result in the agent living a life that is ultimately wasted. On the other hand, failing to become a monk is fine, but not great, either way, if we assume that from a religious point of view becoming a monk is supererogatory and that the individual lives roughly the same life as a non-monk whether or not God exists. To take another example, consider an individual who is deciding whether to use his van to transport 10 critically injured patients to the hospital rather than using his car to transport 1 and who does not have conclusive evidence that his van works (but he has, say, near-conclusive evidence that his car works, or a backup plan in case it doesn't). Or consider an individual who is deciding whether to reveal a secret to someone else, and who does not have conclusive evidence that the friend will keep it; or an individual who is deciding whether to marry a particular person, and does not have conclusive evidence that this person will make a good spouse. In each case, performing the act could turn out very well or poorly, whereas not performing the act is the same either way.15 We could think of the act as an opportunity for something great-but a risky opportunity-that one might take or pass up. Let us assume that given the individual's current credences and utility function, A has a higher expected utility than B, and so A is practically rational given the individual's current information. Now we want to know whether practical rationality requires that the individual gather more information before she makes her decision. There is a theorem that bears directly on this question: I. J. Good (1967) showed that gathering additional evidence (in Good's 15 One might argue that the act couldn't be the same either way, since, e.g., passing up the possibility of a faithful spouse (or an opportunity to save 10 lives) is worse than passing up the possibility of an unfaithful spouse (or an opportunity not to save any lives). I think the question of how decision theory should handle these nuances is an interesting one, but for now, I will just assume that facts about what might have happened do not make a difference to the agent's utility function-or at least that they make a negligible difference. 19 terminology, making a new observation) and then using it to update one's beliefs before making a decision always has a higher expected utility than making a decision without doing so, provided the following two conditions are met: (1) It is not the case that the agent will perform the same act regardless of the evidence she receives. (2) Gathering additional evidence is cost-free. If condition (2) holds but, contrary to (1), the agent will perform the same act regardless of the evidence, then gathering the evidence will have the same expected utility as not doing so.16 In other words, if these two conditions are met, and if rational individuals must choose the act that maximizes expected utility, then it is always rationally permissible to make a new observation and use it, and it is rationally required that one do so if some piece of evidence that might result from doing so will lead one to do B instead of A. VII. COMMITMENT AND INTERPERSONAL COST We can now consider under which circumstances, if any, one is rationally permitted, or rationally required, to have faith. In this section and the next I spell out when it is rational to refrain from examining additional evidence for the purposes of the choice at hand. I assume throughout that the other conditions for the rationality of faith have been met: that the agent's credences are coherent and are such that doing A rather than B maximizes expected utility. I also assume, as Good does, that for each 'experiment' (or bit of searching) the agent is considering performing, the agent can assign credences to the experiment yielding each possible result, \n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "102e5a80-1f71-406b-bb7b-c595e1b9bee4", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "思路内容：宗教哲学讨论"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "82cbb614-a86d-4d6c-bf39-784b39cfd4e3", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "有逻辑性的文章"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "f97e55dc-f9df-4ab3-98aa-e51bb6235b6c", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 知识性内容，包含前言等"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "3acb3233-b946-44e4-ad7f-4288ab502ffd", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "文章，挺有逻辑"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Therefore, for example, their length, their diameter and also various elements of the injection valve being responsible for the way the fluid is dosed may vary in a wide range. In addition to that, injection valves may accommodate an actuator for actuating a valve needle of the injection valve, which may, for example, be an electromagnetic actuator.\nIn order to enhance the combustion process in view of the creation of unwanted emissions, the respective injection valve may be suited to dose fluids under very high pressures. The pressures may be in case of a gasoline engine, for example, in the range of up to 200 bar and in the case of diesel engines in the range of up to 2000 bar.\nAfter a desired injection during the injector closing phase a post injection can occur caused by an injector reopening. Current injector design includes very often a needle armature de-coupled feature. This design increases the impact between armature and upper armature retainer and also allows the needle to have the so called needle overshoot behavior. The needle overshoot happens during the injector standard operating mode: there is a needle overshoot during the needle opening phase. The needle overshoot during the opening phase occurs after that the armature impacts the pole piece impact face. When the armature stops and bounces against the pole piece impact face, the needle continues its motions by the effect of its inertia. By means of this phenomenon the opening phase is controlled for the armature but it is not controlled for the needle. Since the needle movement is responsible for fuel delivery, it happens that just at the end of the opening phase the needle is not in a controlled position in respect to the injector seat. This is unfavorable injector behavior and it impacts in particular way the minimum controllable deliverable flow. Due to the opening phase needle overshoot behavior, the minimum controllable flow quantity is increased. During the closing phase the armature overshoot occurs in the opposite direction, the armature detaches from the armature upper retainer and compresses the anti bounce spring eliminating the needle bounce at closing. Once that the anti bounce spring is compressed it releases the stored energy pushing again the armature against the upper armature retainer generating the unwanted and uncontrolled operating condition of the so called post injection.\n\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "761e221b-ac0e-4e09-857e-796ea1583802", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "知识性内容：喷射阀相关\n逻辑性内容：学术性论述"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "45dc23a7-0cd7-4575-bf06-4da108a1e9b5", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "1. 喷射阀的介绍\n2. 语法错误19个"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "5be3a7ca-8124-4866-8308-ea071cb4e99b", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "具有逻辑性的介绍"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "b44b580f-3f90-4c86-beb1-14239d499b63", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 知识性内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

He was widely recognized to be startlingly strong and a phenomenally accurate passer. During his college career he finished two full seasons without any interceptions and two games with 100 percent completions. Unfortunately, he wasn't drafted because the pro teams felt he was too small.\n\nKristen Taylor captained her college soccer team and was extraordinarily quick. She rarely played a game without a \"steal\" and usually had many.\n\nAllan and Kristen dated more and more seriously throughout college and married at the end of their senior year. Their friends teased them that they were only marrying so that they could start their own sports dynasty.\n\nTheir daughter Ell had Kristen's quickness, magnified by Allan's strength and accuracy. The child also had a new mutation affecting the myelin sheaths surrounding her nerves. This mutation produced nerve transmission speeds that were nearly double those of normal neurons. Nerve impulse transmissions being faster, she had much quicker reflexes. Yet the new myelin sheath was also thinner, allowing more axons, and therefore more neurons, to be packed into the same sized skull. These two factors resulted in a brain which had more neurons, though it wasn't larger and a more rapid processing speed, akin to a computer with a smaller scale CPU architecture that enables faster processor speeds.\n\nMost importantly, under the influence of adrenalin in a \"fight or flight\" situation, her nerves would transmit even more rapidly than their normally phenomenal speed.\n\nMuch more rapidly...\n\nPrologue\n\nNew York— Senator Edith Blaustein (R- NY) with the support of Francis Ementhal, renowned astrophysicist from the Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics at NYU, have submitted a bill aimed directly at Ell Donsaii. This legislation would require Dr. Donsaii to turn over all methods and equipment used in their exploration of the third planet of the star Tau Ceti.\n\nEmenthal says that the methods used to send probes to the stars represent a technological leap forward that must be made available to the entire human race. He says it also \"borders on the insane that a girl, only twenty-four years of age, is acting as de facto ambassador for the human race in our initial interactions with the other inhabitants of our Universe.\" He proposes that a new national committee would be put in charge of alien contact.\n\nInterestingly, Dr. Daniel Hage, Ementhal's own Department Chair at NYU is vehemently opposes to this proposed legislation...\n\nKant Fladwami entered the Oval Office and took the seat indicated by President Flood. Attorney General Aaron Blythe and Secretary of Defense Amundsen, a holdover from the previous administration, sat in the other chairs. Flood turned to Fladwami, \"Kant, in our conversations you've recommended that we not pressure Donsaii to release her interstellar tech to Ementhal's proposed committee of eminent scientists. So far I've agreed with you, but now that Ementhal has got Blaustein taking a bill to Congress we're going to have to do more than 'just say no.' I wanted to have you review your rationale with me again. Aaron will hopefully apprise me of the legal ramifications.\" He waved at Amundsen, \"And I'd like Mark's opinion too. He's known Donsaii a lot longer than either of us, and after all, he's the one that would be responsible for defending us if she does bring the Huns from outer space down on us.\"\n\nKant took a deep breath and glanced at Amundsen. \"Well, the issues are tremendously complex. I take Ementhal's point that encounters with possibly inimical alien races carry tremendous risk, not just for the United States, but for the human race in general. Where he and I differ is in regards to the question of who best should curate these endeavors and risks. Ementhal contends that a committee of brilliant scientists—to which, I would point out, he has had to add politicians in order to get the support of Blaustein and Congress...\" Kant shrugged, \"In any case, a committee... of hopefully brilliant people. He feels such a committee is needed to avoid the possibility of a faux pas in our interactions with an alien race.\" Fladwami looked from the President to Amundsen and sighed, \"Gentlemen, I do not trust committees. In the face of a need for urgent decision, they are often extraordinarily clumsy. I suspect that in such endeavors secrecy may sometimes be necessary, and that such a committee could not be relied upon to maintain that secrecy. Personally, I would prefer to rely on one brilliant person; a person already awarded the Medal of Honor and the Medal of Freedom for exemplary service to our country. I trust Ell Donsaii, whereas no matter how such a committee might be formed, I will never be able to fully trust it.\"\n\nAmundsen opened his mouth to speak but Fladwami put up a hand to forestall him. He said, \"One more point, Mark. I don't think that Donsaii is willing to turn the equipment or the methods over to such a committee. She won't trust them any more than I do. Trying to force her to release that tech might backfire in the worst way.\"\n\n\"Backfire?\" Amundsen said.\n\n\"Backfire,\" Fladwami said emphatically. \"Donsaii has singlehandedly advanced technology and created wealth at a faster pace than any other individual in history.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Blythe interjected, \"all I hear about is how she's destroying the economy.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Fladwami chuckled, \"she's certainly disturbed the economy. With so much change there will, of course, be people losing their jobs. Railroads took jobs from drovers, electricity took jobs from lamp salesmen, and the internet destroyed newspapers. We don't have milkmen anymore either. Now Donsaii's PGR chips are turning the telecomm industry upside down and her ports are revolutionizing transportation. But... they're letting us do things better... and cheaper... so the people who do have jobs can buy things cheaper. The 'woe is me' people aren't pointing out that industry is booming as more and more uses are found for this new technology. Actually, people are being hired in droves. Sure, some people have lost jobs, often jobs they've held for a long time and that they treasure, but unemployment is actually dropping. We should also recognize that the burgeoning exports of her technology have recently given the U.S. a positive balance of trade for the first time in a long time.\"\n\nFlood interrupted, \"This discussion of the economy is interesting, but doesn't have much bearing on the question of whether or not we should be letting one person control our 'first contact' with other intelligent races out there.\"\n\nFladwami quietly but emphatically said, \"It is relevant if we piss off the goose that's been laying the golden eggs by trying to force her do something she feels is unethical.\"\n\nBlythe raised his eyebrows, \"Unethical? Why would she feel it's unethical?\"\n\nFladwami snorted, \"Speaking to me, she's likened giving that committee control of first contact, to handing a gun to a three year old.\"\n\nBlythe stared, \"But you don't give a gun to a psycho either! How can we leave said gun in the control of a single individual!\"\n\n\"You haven't met this individual have you?\"\n\n\"Well, no but... any individual might flake out.\"\n\n\"So can an entire committee, or even an entire country under the sway of a charismatic leader. Look at Nazi Germany. There are plenty of other examples.\"\n\nPresident Flood cleared his throat, \"I propose that we invite said young lady up for a discussion of the issues. I want to hear directly from her the rationale for not wanting a committee to be in charge and discuss other options she may feel are reasonable... Besides, I need to congratulate her before the nation for what she just did in the Olympics.\"\n\n\"You can say that again...\"\n\n***\n\n\"Ms. Donsaii, Ms. Donsaii!\" the reporter in the press pool waved his hand.\n\nEll acknowledged him.\n\n\"We're all aware that none of the medical or drug testing done on you has found any banned substances, but how do you explain your ability to perform at a level so much higher than even the world's most elite athletes,\" he shrugged, \"like those who have attended and competed at these Olympics?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't know.\" Ell grinned at him, \"I can assure you that I haven't found some magic, undetectable drug that lets me run fast. My parents were both very athletic, but so were the parents of many of the athletes at these Olympics. My leading hypothesis is that somehow my nervous and musculoskeletal systems, by the luck of the draw, have every one of their gene selections fall at the extreme end of choices that give up endurance for speed.\" She laughed, \"I assure you I'm a terrible endurance athlete. I'd never be chosen for anyone's long, or even their middle distance track team.\" She pointed to another reporter.\n\n\"How does it feel to have proven Michael Fentis wrong after all those times he said you couldn't actually have run that fast?\"\n\nEll gave a wistful look, \"Kinda sad, actually. Mr. Fentis is an amazing sprinter who rightfully took great pride in his accomplishments. I'm embarrassed and ashamed that I was petty and prideful enough to set out to prove him wrong.\"\n\nStartled glances among the reporters there showed just how few had anticipated that answer...\n\n***\n\nAn enormous crush of reporters and paparazzi waited outside the exits from the Track and Field facilities. Each had their own reasons for choosing the exit they believed that Donsaii would leave through, though some were members of teams that had multiple exits covered. Aware of her propensity to wear ball caps and hoodies to cover her signature strawberry blond hair, every light skinned person wearing such was subjected to intense scrutiny.\n\nNo one noticed the slender dark-skinned girl with the spiky black hair and beaky nose that slipped from one of the smaller exits and looked curiously around at the AV-equipped crowd. She crossed the street, hopping on a bus before it made its turn to head back out toward the hotels. Taking a seat, she leaned her head against the window and was gone.\n\nSalah boarded the bus away from the Olympic venues and nearly sat next to another man before he saw the girl. She had on a snug t-shirt and jeans. With a smile he slid into the seat next to her, \"Hello,\" he said, gazing at her breasts and noticing the odd design on the front of her shirt. It had a red circle with a slash through it, over a hand. \"What's the meaning of your shirt?\" he asked, sliding a hand down between their legs so it rested against her thigh. A nice firm thigh he noticed with some delight.\n\nHer hand followed his down between their legs and onto his hand. \"It means,\" she said, \"keep your hands to yourself.\" She grasped his index finger and started bending it backward,\n\nSalah reached over with his other hand and grabbed at her wrist, \"Hey! What are you doing?!\" The girl was astonishingly strong!\n\nDespite his grip she continued to turn his finger back until it really hurt. Trying to take the stress off of it, he slid off the seat and crouched to his knees.\n\nLooking at him with icy green eyes, she said, \"If I let go, will you keep your hands to yourself from now on?\"\n\n\"Achhh!\" Humiliated and embarrassed, Salah ground out, \"Yes! Yes!\"\n\nShe let go and he shook his hand out with some relief, but also growing anger. She'd brought it on herself, after all, dressing like a sleazy tart! Tight shirt and pants, spiky hair, colored contacts! How did she have the gall to disrespect him for acting in a fashion she'd as much as asked for? The bus bumped along, stopping here and there. Salah's temper rose. Inside he fumed with a desire for revenge. Then she taunted him by cheerfully, as if nothing had happened between them, getting up and saying, \"This is my stop.\"\n\nAs her legs separated to step past his knees into the aisle, Salah couldn't resist.\n\nHe shot his hand up between them...\n\nBefore his hand reached her crotch, something struck him in the cheek. People on the bus turned to stare at the whipcrack sound.\n\nSomething had hit him, hard! Salah at first thought another passenger had knocked into his head with some large piece of rigid luggage.\n\nBut then, leaving no doubt about who had delivered the blow, the girl leaned down and growled, \"I told you to keep your hands to yourself!\" Confused and woozy, Salah groped for the glasses which had flown off his face.\n\nPeople stared at Salah while the girl got off the bus without further incident. His equilibrium recovered, but he had a difficult time explaining his massively bruised face, black eye and broken glasses to his parents when he got home.\n\nChapter One\n\nDelhi, India—As the Track and Field events of these Olympics conclude, all that anyone can talk about is the complete destruction of the world records in the sprint distances by Ell Donsaii. She is now not just the women's record holder in the three sprint distances and the long jump, but she has broken the men's records as well. She has accomplished this astonishing feat without braggadocio, instead constantly praising her competitors for their accomplishments, no matter how meager those accomplishments now seem. People have begun asking, \"Could this woman perform at an unbelievable level in other sports if she wished?\"\n\nAs Ell walked the last part of the route to her hotel Allan said, \"You have a call from Dr. Kant Fladwami.\"\n\n\"Put him on... Dr. Fladwami, what can I do for you?\"\n\n\"The President has asked me to arrange a meeting. He'd like to both congratulate you on the Olympics and speak to you about alien contact. When will you be back here in the States?\"\n\n\"Um, I'm planning a little vacation over here before I return next week. Do you need me to call that off?\"\n\n\"No, no, that'd be fine. Could you come by the week after next?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n***\n\nThe door banged open and Ell bounded into the hotel room, dressed in her \"Ellen\" get up. \"Shan!\" she shouted gleefully, leaping onto the bed and throwing her arms around him.\n\n\"What held you up?\" Shan asked hugging her back.\n\n\"Coach Black caught me. Turns out I was supposed to be 'making myself available to the press' after my last event of each day of the Olympics rather than immediately sneaking off in disguise. So I sat for a press conference and answered a lot of predictable questions with predictable answers.\" She raised an eyebrow, \"But, now we can get out of here!\"\n\n\"Tired of India already?\"\n\n\"Yup. The men here are really crude. I got groped again today.\"\n\n\"Damn!\" Shan grimaced, feeling like he should have been there to protect her, though he suspected she could protect herself better than he could. \"Did he get another dose of your pepper spray?\"\n\nEll frowned, \"No, he caught me by surprise and I slapped him before I thought to spray him... I feel pretty bad about it.\"\n\nShan snorted, \"You think a slap was worse than being pepper sprayed?\"\n\nShe winced, \"Yeah. I hit him pretty hard.\"\n\nShan shrugged, still doubtful. Changing the subject he said, \"So where are we going?\"\n\n\"Where do you want to go? We've got four more days before we have to be in Venice to catch our plane back to the US.\"\n\n\"Greece?\"\n\n\"Oooohh! The islands?\"\n\nShan shrugged, \"Sure.\"\n\n\"Allan,\" Ell said to her AI (Artificial Intelligence), \"Check us out of this hotel. Tell the pilots we're on our way to the airport and want to fly to a Greek island.\"\n\n\"Which island?\" Allan asked.\n\n\"One with an airport. We don't care much which one. Tell them to surprise us.\" She turned to Shan, \"Is that OK with you?\"\n\nShan nodded.\n\n\"Steve,\" Ell said so that Allan would connect her to her security detail. \"We're heading to the airport. You guys ready enough that we could head downstairs now?\"\n\n***\n\nShan lifted his head off the sheets and peered out the window at the gleaming white buildings of Santorini. He stretched and got up, padding to the window. The sun, rising behind him, lit the scattered, brilliantly blue domes that topped some of the buildings. Straight out the window was an infinity pool, and beyond that the cliff dropped down into the caldera of the ancient Thera volcano on which Santorini perched. The sapphire waters of the Aegean filled the entire bowl of the volcano except for the small island, Nea Kameni, out in the middle.\n\nShaking his head over the beautiful scenery, he turned to head into the next room. Ell lay relaxed on the couch, studying a bizarre graph on the large wall screen. \"Hey girl, jetlag isn't kicking my ass so bad this time. Think I'm toughening up?\"\n\nShe smiled brilliantly up at him. \"Hey, yourself. The time zone only changed two hours, plus jetlag isn't as bad going west as it is going east. I suspect you're just as weak as you've always been.\"\n\nShan frowned, \"You know, your constant belittling of my jetlag tolerance is probably gonna turn me into a eunuch.\"\n\n\"Hah!\" She leapt up from the couch and took him by the hand, pulling him back toward the bedroom. Tossing him a crooked smile over her shoulder, she said, \"Well then, honeymoon boy, we'd better exercise your manhood while it's still functional.\"\n\n***\n\nEll lay, head on Shan's shoulder, running a finger gently over his chest. Shan said, \"So what did you have graphed on the screen in the other room?\"\n\n\"Oh I'm using Mathematica to display what we know about the conditions for formation of the various carbon allotropes. It just seems to me that a good graph would help us understand it better. If we understood it, we might be able to move away from following a recipe that the sigmas told us created a particular allotrope to being able to say, 'this particular set of conditions should optimally synthesize... say diamond.'\"\n\n\"Really? Can I look at that? The pattern you had up looks like a...\" He paused at her upraised hand.\n\nEll's eyes had widened before she put up her halting hand, \"Of course! Come in and look. I've been stymied! Don't tell me what pattern you're seeing; I don't want to influence you. I'll just tell you what's being graphed and then let you play with it while I make a breakfast to restore your strength.\"\n\nEll came back in the living room of their little villa carrying a small tray loaded with sliced toasted bagels slathered in butter. A tub of cream cheese was in her other hand. \"What do you think? Does it fit the pattern you thought it did?\"\n\nShan stared at the plate she had in her hands with widened eyes. \"Was once the day when, seeing that, I would have thought you'd invited some people over for breakfast... But, I'll bet you're planning to eat all but one of those bagels by yourself aren't you?\"\n\nEll blushed faintly, \"Hey, I have been getting a lot of exercise the past few days you know?\"\n\nShan barked a laugh, \"You know you'd eat all of that even if you hadn't just been kicking ass in the Olympics!\"\n\n\"Not so! I made myself an extra bagel 'cause of all that extra exercise.\"\n\nShan shook his head and picked up half a bagel. \"I should just be glad I'm not the one having to keep you in food.\" He scooped up some cream cheese and put a dollop on one side. He took a large bite and leaned back expansively, stretching his arms on the back of the couch and chewing contentedly.\n\n\"Hey!\" Ell poked him in the side. \"I made you these fine bagels; you can't just sit there chewing your cud. You owe me your thoughts on the graph.\"\n\nShan lifted a chin towards the wall screen, \"Read 'em and weep, my little lady. Read 'em and weep. Then I think you should put more cream cheese on my bagel, I'm kinda tired from all that work.\"\n\nEll's head snapped around and she focused on the screen. A three dimensional graph that looked somewhat like an undulating landscape had some of the sigma's specified conditions near some sharp peaks and other sigma specifications near some of the deep valleys. \"My God Shan,\" she hissed, \"That's gorgeous! I've been assuming that the sigma's specifications were optimal, but you're thinking I couldn't get them to fit because they aren't actually the best conditions, right? You think if we adjusted the conditions to fall on the peaks of this plot we'd get even better formation of those particular allotropes?\"\n\n\"That's what I think,\" he waved a negligent hand. \"However, I am but a humble theoretical mathematician. Merely a simple soul, schooled in the use of this modest computational engine.\"\n\nEll snorted, \"Humble!\" Picking up the tub of cream cheese she spread some on a bagel and, taking a big bite, dropped back against the couch to stare at the display. \"As soon as I finish this meager breakfast, I'm gonna have to take you out and demonstrate my admiration.\"\n\n\"I thought you just demonstrated that in the other room?\"\n\n***\n\nWhen Gary arrived at D5R in the morning, his AI told him he had a message from Ell that had arrived the night before. He was to pick up a PGR chip from Sheila that would link him directly to Ell's AI so she could send him a confidential message.\n\nSheila handed him the chip, telling him that Ell had said he should keep that particular chip for future restricted communications.\n\n\"OK,\" he replied, pulling off his headband and socketing the chip in place as he headed for one of the little conference rooms. He had initially planned to just go out into the main research room where he usually worked and watch it on his HUD. With all the cloak and dagger over the chip though, he decided he ought to watch it in a private room, at least 'til he knew what it was.\n\nOnce connected securely, Ell's AI delivered a brief recorded message in which Ell said, \"Gary, I've been working with Shan Kinrais from the Math Department at UNC to plot out the conditions for formation of the various allotropes. He's made a real breakthrough. See the attached graphic plot. We believe the plot diagrams the conditions where you will get the best formation of each different allotrope. Of note, please look at the two neighboring peaks at the upper right. You'll see that, in this region, conditions for graphene and diamond are very close to one another except for a small difference in temperature. If this works out to be true, we believe that you should be able to stitch layers of graphene together with tetrahedral diamond bonds. What we call 'graphend.' You just apply a bit more heat with a micro laser beam at each point where you want to bond the sheets to one another. Lots of cross bonds for a material that you want to be stiff in bending, very few bonds for materials loaded mostly in tension but that you don't want flaking apart.\"\n\nGary had opened the graph. His eye had immediately tracked to a graphene synthesis point that had conditions similar to what he was using to make graphene out at the space habitat. Could the conditions at the peak provide even cleaner or more rapid synthesis? Idly he wondered when Ell and Shan had found the time to collaborate. Ell had been competing in the Olympics and last he had heard Shan was on his honeymoon. Online he guessed.\n\nThen his brain caught up to what she'd said about stitching together layers of graphene and he felt prickles in his scalp...\n\n***\n\nShan walked out of the little kitchenette in their villa with a Zeos Pilsner in one hand. Ell stood at the window overlooking the caldera with her arms stretched out high and wide. He walked over and put his arms around her.\n\nTurning, she snuggled in to his embrace, tucking her head against his shoulder.\n\nShan thought that the moment was close to perfect. All seemed to be right with their world.\n\nAfter a moment she leaned her head back and said, \"Hey, feel like going to a deserted beach?\"\n\n\"Sure, but I already checked, the nice beaches on Santorini are all crowded.\"\n\n\"I was thinking maybe we'd go to one of the little deserted islands near here.\"\n\n\"Hah! Those islands look close on the map but they're actually fifteen to twenty miles from here. If we hired a local boat it'd take a couple hours to get there and a couple more to come back. I'm not sure it's worth it?\"\n\n\"Why don't we fly?\"\n\n\"Deserted islands don't have airports!\"\n\n\"Helicopter?\"\n\n\"Hmm, I know they have a chopper that takes people on tours of the island. Are you thinking we could charter it?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" Ell raised an eyebrow. \"But we could take the little ultralight quadcopter we brought in the Gulfstream.\"\n\nShan's eyes widened, \"What kind of helicopter would fit into that little jet?\"\n\nEll winked at him. \"A little one.\"\n\nAn hour later Shan found himself beside a fairly deserted road, holding a small backpack with five gyro sandwiches and two collapsible cups. Ell and Steve were arguing about whether it was safe for her to take the little helicopter up. Nearby were a couple of SUVs Steve had rented for the security team.\n\nShan stared at the device Ell had pulled out of one of the SUVs. It had been in five pieces which she had snapped together. However, even after assembly, Ell had carried the entire thing by herself suggesting it wasn't very heavy. Almost every part of it looked like it was made out of carbon fiber. It had a couple of large ducted fans, front and back, with smaller ones on each side, mounted a little closer to the back. She set it on its side, and snapped down three spindly little legs with wheels. The legs had all been folded up against the saddle which bridged from the front fan to the back one. Once she'd clicked the legs down, she flipped it up onto the wheels.\n\nThe whole time Ell worked on the copter, Steve kept up a constant harangue about how dangerous this was, how it was probably against Greek law and that he couldn't believe she would consider taking her new husband up in it. \"You told me,\" Steve said, \"that Shan wouldn't even approve of you flying these 'copters, much less taking him with you!\"\n\nEll turned to him, hands on her hips. \"Steve,\" she grinned, \"my mother doesn't nag this much! Take it as a given that I'm going to go somewhere on this chopper. Shan's a big boy, he can decide for himself whether he wants to go or not.\" She turned to Shan, \"I'm gonna take it up for a little ride to make sure everything's working. That way you can see how it works and decide if you want to go for a ride too, OK?\"\n\nShan nodded numbly. He'd always pictured himself as the daredevil of his family. He'd be the one who would have to talk his wife into doing exciting stuff. But a little helicopter she'd designed herself and that the guys in the D5R machine shop built for her? Could his new wife be completely out of her mind?\n\nEll went over to the SUV and pulled on some coverall type pants and a jacket then turned to Barrett, \"Toss me my brain bucket.\"\n\nBarrett actually handed her the helmet and she pulled it on, right over her HUD. She pushed the little 'copter around to the other side of the SUV so the spectators would be protected from any accident. Straddling the seat she twisted the throttle a little then lifted and pulled back on the handlebars while looking at the rotors in the front duct. There were two rotors inside the duct and they began slowly counter rotating. She gradually sped them up; apparently feeling for vibration which would suggest something was out of balance. Then she pushed the handlebars forward while looking back over her shoulder at the back fan. It spun up smoothly as well. Centering the handlebars front to back she lifted and all four fans spun up. The two side ducts had single rotors in them, turning clockwise on the right and counterclockwise on the left. She twisted the throttle a little more and air began blowing out much harder. The lightweight craft lifted off the ground before it had thrown up very much dust.\n\nStaying close to the ground, Ell flew it off about a hundred yards away, then lifted into the air about twenty feet. She made some little circles and figure eights, then flew back over closer to the SUV and landed. As the rotors spun down, she lifted her visor, grinned at Shan and said, \"You ready to go out to an island?\"\n\nShan looked over at Steve, \"have you tried this out?\"\n\nSteve rolled his eyes and shook his head.\n\nShan frowned at Ell, \"Are you sure it can lift both of us?\"\n\n\"Yup,\" she patted the frame. \"High strength carbon fiber. It'll be even lighter when we can make it out of graphend, but for now this is pretty good stuff. The motors back in my barn that're driving the fans put out a total of 500 horsepower so it's actually way overpowered.\"\n\n\"What happens if the rotors come apart, do we have 'chutes?\"\n\n\"If the rotors come apart our biggest problem would be shrapnel but that should be contained in the ducts. Fragments could fly out above or below the ducts, but that's one of the reasons there are screens top and bottom over the ducts, though the top ones also keep the fans from sucking stuff in. So, the rotor shouldn't hit us, but we would go down, so we won't fly very high. We'd fall right into the Aegean out there. Water's pretty warm, about 75oF so we'll be OK for quite a while. We'll just call Steve to rent a boat and come out after us.\"\n\n\"Do we wear life vests?\"\n\nEll slapped her jacket, \"This thing is flotation Kevlar so you ain't goin' down unless you take it off.\"\n\nShan looked over at Steve who shook his head in frustration, then back at Ell who beamed unrepentantly.\n\nShe said, \"You gonna be a fuddy duddy, or you gonna climb on the bitch seat and live a little?\"\n\nShan shook his head woefully, \"I'll bet I'm gonna regret this. You got a helmet and Kevlar suit for me?\"\n\nEll pointed at the SUV, but when Shan turned Barrett was already standing behind him with a helmet and suit his size. A few minutes after that Shan was sitting on the back seat behind Ell. There were a couple of hand grips and Ell's slender waist to hold onto. \"What, no seat belt?\"\n\n\"I thought about it, but it seems like you'd want to be able to bail out. Motorcycles don't have seat belts either. So grab hold and let's go for a ride.\" She turned her head and leaned back to look at him, \"Or you could sit this one out.\" She reached out and adjusted the mounting for the handlebars so they weren't so close to her.\n\nShan sighed, \"Have you ever flown this thing before today?\"\n\n\"Flew version one, which was more like a helicopter, about twenty times. This quadcopter version is number two. I've been up in it a couple times before that little run I just made to check it out.\" Excitedly she started pointing out its features. \"The front and rear ducted fans counter rotate to eliminate gyroscopic effects and each duct has a 175 horsepower engine powering the fans through ports. The two smaller 75 horse ducts pivot.\" She pushed and pulled on the handlebars to show them pivoting front to back. When they're straight down they help lift and tilt us side to side. Pivot them back and they push us forward so we can fly faster than a typical helicopter. Pivot them forward and they become our brakes to slow us down. The 'copter has a pretty high powered AI controlling all the fans so if I pass out and let go of the handlebars it will just slowly lower itself down to the ground and land in an empty space. Driving it is pretty easy. The twist throttle supplies a general level of power. Lift the handlebars and it goes up. Lower them and it drops. Turn them left or right to go those directions, and tilt them to 'bank' it. Push the handlebars forward to go forward and pull them back to slow down or reverse. The AI controls it all by speeding and slowing the fans and pivoting the two side ducts.\n\n\"Oh hell,\" Shan sighed, \"I guess I can't drag this out any longer. Take me up and let's check out the beaches.\"\n\n\"You've got a ported snorkel in that zippered upper left front pocket... just in case we fall in the water.\" The rotors started spinning up as Shan closed his visor. When the wheels got light Ell pushed on the handlebars to tilt the 'copter slightly forward. With a little more lift on the handlebars the hoverbike lifted off the ground and began skimming forward, over the road, across the beach, and out towards the Aegean.\n\nEll lifted them a little higher and they sailed out over the tops of the waves at an altitude of about five feet.\n\nShan found it breathtaking, a lot like his first ride on a motorcycle. But better!\n\nOnce he felt comfortable, Ell lifted to about ten feet and made some exhilarating \"S\" turns, then turned up the speed as they headed northeast from Santorini. Despite the wind noise outside, with his HUD inside the helmet and noise cancellation from his AI he could still talk to Ell fairly easily. \"How do we find an island out here?\"\n\n\"Well, Allan's leading me to Anydros by GPS but...\" she lifted the handlebars and they rose to about thirty feet where they could easily see a little island that had actually just been coming up over the horizon. \"There it is.\" Then she dropped back down to just above the water.\n\nSkimming along just above the water made it seem like they were going a lot faster. \"How fast are we going?\" Shan asked.\n\n\"Only about eighty. We could go faster, but even if we crash at this speed, those soft looking waves are gonna hit us pretty hard. It isn't that far, so we should be there in about ten more minutes at this speed.\"\n\nAs they arrived at Anydros, Ell curved around the south end and swept up the eastern coast of the mile long island. She turned in at a small cove with a beach on the far side and coasted in for a landing just beyond the sand. Flipping up her visor, she turned to Shan, eyes dancing. \"Was that great or what?\" She leapt off the seat and pulled off her helmet and her \"Raquel\" wig.\n\nShan dismounted and pulled off his helmet too, unable to keep the delight out of his eyes. \"Yeah! That was great! When do I get to fly it?\"\n\nPeeling off her Kevlar suit Ell said, \"Hmm, the first time, I think you should fly it from the back seat with your arms around me. That way I can help if you start getting out of control.\" She lifted an eyebrow, \"I like having your arms around me.\" She started unbuttoning her shirt.\n\nThinking that she'd have a bikini under her clothes, Shan's eyes widened when he saw she didn't. \"No swim suit?\"\n\nEll raised her eyebrows, \"Who needs a suit? This island is deserted! She plucked her snorkel and some goggles out of the pocket on her Kevlar suit, then loped gracefully across the sand into the waves.\n\nShan stared admiringly after her for a moment, then started digging for his own snorkel.\n\nAfter playing in the waves a while and snorkeling under them to look at the sea life, they walked back out of the sea. Ell spun joyously around, swinging her arms and laughing. \"This is beautiful!\"\n\nShan nodded, \"You are indeed.\"\n\n\"No, you doofus,\" Ell beamed at him, \"I meant the island and the sea and the beach and being alone on it with you.\"\n\n\"Well, that too.\" Shan grinned at her. \"I'm feeling hungry; how 'bout we get around those gyros you put in my backpack?\"\n\n\"Great idea!\" Ell said, patting her flat stomach and turning to trot that way.\n\nShan dug out the sandwiches and the two collapsible cups, then felt around in the empty backpack. \"Hey, did you put in any drinks? All that's in this backpack are the gyros and a couple of empty cups.\"\n\nShe patted his stomach, \"Maybe we need to drink some of this here six-pack?'\n\nShan snorted, \"We could get pretty thirsty out here with nothin' but saltwater for 20 miles.\"\n\nShe held out her hand, \"Well, let me see one of those cups.\"\n\nShan handed her one of the collapsible cups and she popped it open and turned her back to him. He stared, wondering what she thought she was doing, but then he heard the distinctive sound of beer pouring. She's naked! Where is beer coming from? Shan peered over her shoulder to see beer pouring into the cup from a spot in space about two inches in front of her belly button. It stopped for a moment, then resumed pouring from a spot just closer to her than it had been coming from, then paused again and began pouring from a little farther away. He snorted, \"You're using that single-ended port you put behind your belly button—for beer?\"\n\nEll grinned at him, \"Don't you go acting all hoity-toity on me. I might just pour this beer of yours out in the sand.\"\n\n\"Who's pouring that beer in there for you? It must be what, six in the morning back in North Carolina?\"\n\n\"Yep, you're gonna need to thank Amy for gettin' up so early, just to satisfy your thirst for alcoholic beverages.\"\n\n\"Hah! You're not going to have her pour you a drink?\"\n\n\"Well, of course. As long as she's already had to get up to pour one for you, pouring one for me too doesn't seem like too much additional trouble does it?\"\n\nShan laughed.\n\nShe held his beer out to him and plucked the other cup out of his hand. A moment later Coke started pouring into her cup.\n\nThey sat peacefully on a large smooth boulder at the water's edge. Waves lapped at their feet while they ate their gyros. Shan sipped at his beer, looking out over the sea, glancing at the beautiful woman at his side. He thought about how, if someone had told him a few years earlier he might be doing this today, he would never have believed.\n\nEll turned to him and said, \"You ready to try flying our little hoverbike yourself?\"\n\n\"Yeah!\"\n\nEll used her port to fill their cups with fresh water several times so they could splash the salt water off. Once the sun had dried them off, they put their clothes on and packed their trash back in the backpack. Shan straddled the hoverbike and Ell got on in front of him. Ell said, \"I suggest you spool up the fans, staying short of where they'd lift us off. Then try moving the handlebars around to get the feel of what they do. In flight the AI should keep you from flipping the bike over or doing anything really dumb, but if you want to feel like you're flying it, it's good to have an idea what's going to happen when you do things with the controller.\"\n\nShan twisted the throttle grip a little and checked to make sure all the fans were turning. Tilting the handlebars side to side made the bike strain to tilt against its wheels. He pulled back and pushed forward and then leveled it. He lifted the handle bars to hear the fans all spin up, straining to lift off but unable to rise at the low throttle setting.\n\n\"All right, give it a little more throttle. \"\n\nShan did and it lifted smoothly off the ground. \"I didn't think it would be so steady.\"\n\n\"Trust me,\" Ell laughed, \"without the AI, it wouldn't be. Give it more throttle, but lower the handlebars. It'll be even steadier with lots of power available, but the AI reducing the power because the handlebars indicate you aren't trying to lift very high.\"\n\nShan gradually gave it more throttle while lowering the bars to keep the hoverbike about three to five feet off the ground.\n\n\"All right, take it down into the cove and let's have you practice some circles and figure eights.\"\n\n\"Why not right here?\" Shan asked, though he did start skimming the hoverbike down across the beach to the water.\n\n\"If you wreck it here, you'll land on something hard. I'd rather we bashed our delicate heads on the water.\"\n\nOut over the water, Ell had Shan practice banking to match the tightness of his turns so bike didn't skid around the curves. For amusement, he did make a couple of turns without banking at all which—as long as he didn't push forward on the handlebars and activate the pusher fans on the sides—had the effect of simply spinning the hoverbike while it continued coasting mostly in the same direction.\n\n\"That was fun!\" Shan laughed after a while. \"Shall we head back to Santorini?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\nShan curved out and around the south end of the island, turning toward Santorini. \"What the hell is that?\"\n\nA cloud of dirty yellow brown smoke hung over the island.\n\n\"Allan,\" Ell said, \"What's happened at Santorini?\"\n\n\"There has been a small eruption of the Thera volcano at Santorini with new lava flows emanating from the Nea Kameni island in the middle of the caldera. At present it does not appear to threaten the surrounding caldera islands. The only danger at present appears to be to a group of tourists who were hiking the small crater on Nea Kameni. They have been trapped between a pair of lava flows. Tour helicopters are attempting to pick them up at present, but there is not sufficient space for the helicopters to land.\"\n\n\"Oh my God!\" Ell exclaimed, taking the controls. \"Let's see if we can help!\" She cranked the throttle grip wide open and smoothly pushed the handlebars forward and slightly up. As they leaned forward to decrease wind resistance, the hoverbike rose to about twenty feet and rocketed forward, quickly reaching two hundred miles per hour. At that speed they reached Santorini in about six minutes, Ell lifting the handlebars so that they rose over the northeastern rim of the caldera. Once they crossed the rim she dropped down toward the little island out in the middle of the huge caldera. Clouds of sulfurous smoke were billowing out of the crater in its center. Saying to Shan, \"Use your snorkel!\" Ell fumbled hers out of her pocket and up into the helmet.\n\nThey slid in over the island. East of the little crater at the center of Nea Kameni they could see about twenty people isolated between a couple of lava flows. A helicopter hovered over them, but because of the slope it couldn't get close enough for any of the people to actually board it. Finally, while Ell and Shan watched, a man leapt up and grabbed one of the landing skids. The small helicopter sank for a moment under his added weight but then lifted back up and carried him to safety about a hundred yards away. They'd saved one, but it was very obvious that only individuals with a high level of physical fitness could be rescued in that manner.\n\nOnce the helicopter set the man down, it pulled away and flew toward the main island, presumably to get a rescue sling.\n\nEll swung off to one side and brought the hoverbike down on a fairly flat area. She hopped off and turned away from the trapped people. Suddenly an eight foot length of 1\" nylon rope shot out from just in front of her abdomen. She grabbed the front end, but let the trailing end fall. Then another and another shot out, until she had five ropes. Then a small bundle of black thread popped out. She tied loops into the five pieces of rope, then wrapped one end of the thread around the knots so that all five loops formed a bundle at the knots. The other end of the black thread she tied around the saddle of the hoverbike. Shan had been watching the people trapped in the lava flow, trying to think of a solution for rescuing them. He looked down at what she was doing. Opening his mouth to speak clumsily around the snorkel he asked, \"What's that for?\"\n\n\"It's one of Gary's graphene cables. The only way I could get a hundred yards of cable through the port during the three seconds a one way port will stay open. You're going to fly the hoverbike straight up and lift me over to get some of those people. I'll give you directions.\"\n\nStaring wide eyed at the heavy thread she'd tied to the hoverbike, Shan said, \"I know graphene's strong, but that stuff isn't even a millimeter in diameter!\"\n\n\"Ten thousand pound test. It won't be our failure point... I'm going to run out to the side to pull the graphene cable out straight. If a loop of it were to get sucked into the intake of the hoverbike's fans, that would be a disaster.\" She picked up the five loops of rope and trotted away.\n\nShan's eyebrows rose while he imagined what would happen to the fans if ten thousand pound test thread got wound into them. He glanced back over at the trapped people. One of them was throwing up, whether from anxiety or from the sulfurous fumes Shan didn't know. Shan looked back at Ell, \"Shouldn't you be flying this while I give you guidance in dangling the ropes to them? You've got the flying experience.\"\n\n\"You'll do fine. The AI'll help. I'm going to ride over to them on the cable, then help them get into the ropes. My gymnastics might come in handy...OK,\" Ell said, tugging on the cable, \"take the bike up slow.\"\n\nShan gently twisted the throttle and lifted the bars. The bike lifted slowly and Ell started walking back toward him as the cable started reeling her in.\n\n\"You can go up a little faster... OK, slow now.\" Ell pulled one of the one inch rope loops over her head and put her arms out over it so it went behind her back and came out under her armpits in front. She bent her knees and a moment later the cable lifted her and the other loops off the ground. Shan wasn't going perfectly straight up so she dragged her feet to keep from swinging like a pendulum. \"OK, I'm off the ground. Lift a little more and move south toward the people... OK, slow, slower, reverse a little. Drop down five feet now.\"\n\nShrinking away from the heat of the lava, Aki Nishikawa blinked his watering eyes and coughed as he watched the bizarre craft land. It looked a little like a big motorcycle with huge front and back wheels turned on their sides. Or like a saddle suspended between two Frisbees. One of the riders hopped off and began fooling around with some ropes. Aki looked back toward the caldera islands, hoping to see a real helicopter coming back. When he turned back to look at the Frisbee craft again, it had lifted into the air and the man who'd gotten off was quite a ways away from it, still holding his ropes. A moment later he began trotting back toward where the Frisbee craft had been sitting. Aki wondered why the man had gotten off, but then the guy just lifted off the ground.\n\nAki blinked vigorously but couldn't see how the guy could be flying up into the air like that. Glancing up, he saw the Frisbee craft straight up above him, as if it were pulling the guy up, but there wasn't anything connecting the craft to the man. The guy had on a motorcycle helmet and suit and one of the ropes looped under one arm behind his back and back up under the other armpit. The rope was tight and appeared to be lifting him, but whatever was lifting the rope wasn't in evidence. It did seem to point up toward the hovering Frisbee craft though. The guy was swinging toward Aki's group! Could this be a rescue attempt? It looked like the guy might swing right by and Aki reached out to catch him.\n\nThen he started to drop.\n\n_Chikushō_! He's going to land in the lava!\n\nInstead the guy reached up overhead, grasped the ropes as high as he could reach and kipped up in an amazing gymnastic display, turning upside down to lift his feet up and over the lava. He righted himself and dropped nimbly back to the ground right next to Aki.\n\nAki grabbed at the guy to steady him, but he didn't seem to need it.\n\nA girl's muffled voice issued from the helmet! \"OK, drop a couple of feet to loosen the cable then hold steady there. Allan's going to have the hoverbike's AI help you maintain that position using GPS.\" The young woman in the motorcycle garb flipped up her visor, reached in the opening to take a mouthpiece out of her mouth, and then shouted out at the tour group, \"OK! We can fly you to safety four at a time. Step up and loop your arms in the ropes like I have mine. We'll come back for more.\"\n\nNo one answered because few understood. Aki translated the woman's English into Japanese for the group and several stepped forward. A mother held out her crying child to the woman. The kid only looked to be about three to four years old. The young woman appeared to be startled, but did take the little girl from her mother. She asked Aki to have the four people who'd taken ropes stand back to back with her.\n\nCoughing some more, Aki desperately wanted to take a rope for himself but decided that the women should go first. Besides, I should stay to translate. He swallowed as the ropes came tight on the group. He could hear the whine of fans above where the Frisbee craft hung above them and even though it was fifty meters up he could see the sulfurous fumes blowing away from its downdraft. The girl and the four people lifted slowly into the air, still without Aki being able to see what was attaching them to the hoverbike or otherwise could be lifting them. They swung across the lava flow and over to what looked like a safe area about a hundred and fifty meters away. The people dropped out of their ropes and one of them took the child from the young woman.\n\nMoments later the young woman rose back off the ground and swung back over to Aki's group. Landing again she flipped up her visor and shouted, \"Ready for four more!\"\n\nAs Aki looked on, the woman made three more trips back and forth, ferrying four people each trip. Finally Aki and two others were all that was left. As the young woman landed to pick them up, the fumes overcame the old man standing next to Aki. As the fellow began to collapse he staggered toward the lava flow. Aki reached out, knowing he would be too late. The old man is going to be horribly burned!\n\nInstead, the girl in the motorcycle helmet leapt after the old man. Moving with what seemed to be impossible quickness she caught him and dragged him back. She looped a rope twice around the old man's chest and turned back to Aki.\n\n\"Get your rope on! We've got to go! Now!\"\n\nAki saw that the third man had his rope on so Aki quickly stepped into a loop and put his arms over the rope.\n\nThe girl put her arms around the old man and said, \"Up!\"\n\nThe rope snugged up and cut into Aki's armpits, but with th\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "89a395ba-b771-4548-a095-0d827a68364f", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "书籍的序言"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "e01e3ce0-42ae-48cf-a67b-e404a05f5dbb", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "思路内容：故事书籍"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "6aa976ec-e3c5-4aa4-b95c-5f183c8b5a45", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "正常的小说文本"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "c52316e9-952a-4d1e-b384-82bb01bbeccd", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 逻辑：段落间有关联"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

O seu árduo trabalho possibilitou o acordo com o Conselho em primeira leitura, facto com que a Comissão se congratula. Uma vez mais, estamos a tratar a questão das substâncias químicas e da protecção das pessoas e do ambiente face aos seus efeitos potencialmente perigosos.\nAs substâncias químicas não constituem um problema exclusivamente europeu, nem tão-pouco um monopólio europeu. Estas substâncias são produzidas, comercializadas e utilizadas em todo o mundo, e os riscos associados à sua utilização são os mesmos, seja qual for o local. Portanto, é lógico que nos tenhamos esforçado por obter um sistema mundial para descrever e rotular estes produtos perigos. A legislação que hoje vamos aprovar cria as bases para uma informação uniforme a nível mundial em matéria de ambiente, saúde e segurança relativamente aos produtos químicos potencialmente perigosos.\nA protecção da saúde e do ambiente apenas passará a ser transparente e comparável a nível mundial quando forem utilizadas normas harmonizadas de medição para determinar e rotular os perigos que os produtos químicos envolvem. Também não devemos subestimar as vantagens económicas. As empresas europeias economizarão dinheiro, pois não precisão de avaliar os procedimentos químicos perigosos aplicados nos diferentes países, de acordo com critérios diferentes e sistemas diferentes. Os utilizadores profissionais de produtos químicos e os consumidores de todo o mundo beneficiarão igualmente desta harmonização. As pessoas que utilizam produtos químicos já não terão de se familiarizar com os vários sistemas diferentes para saberem qual o nível de ameaça que um determinado produto pode representar.\nO compromisso apresentado pela relatora é equilibrado e tem em devida conta aspectos como a praticabilidade e a clareza das disposições. Embora as alterações propostas pelos co-legisladores sejam numerosas, não alteram de modo significativo os princípios subjacentes ou a estrutura básica da proposta original da Comissão. A Comissão pode, por conseguinte, aceitar estas propostas. Mesmo quando estava a preparar a proposta, a Comissão teve a preocupação de manter o actual nível de protecção da saúde humana e do meio ambiente, que já é muito elevado. Estou muito satisfeito por ver que o Parlamento e o Conselho partilham o nosso ponto de vista fundamental a este respeito. A estreita e construtiva cooperação entre o Parlamento, o Conselho e a Comissão beneficiou em grande medida o processo de negociação e, como já referi, isto significa que podemos aceitar todas as propostas de compromisso sugeridas pela senhora deputada Sartori.\nAmalia Sartori\nSenhor Presidente, Senhoras e Senhores Deputados, como já lembrei o Senhor Comissário, nos últimos meses abordámos uma e outra vez a questão da classificação, rotulagem e embalagem de substâncias e misturas químicas, um sistema mais conhecido pelo acrónimo \"GHS”, para o qual sou relatora.\nPor esta razão, em vez de discutir os pormenores técnicos do dossiê novamente, gostaria de começar por agradecer aos meus colegas e relatores-sombra com quem trabalhei numa base de grande colaboração e transparência, entabulando um diálogo construtivo e extremamente satisfatório. Gostaria em especial de agradecer o apoio e a confiança que depositaram em mim, o que me permitiu dispor de uma boa base para levar a bom termo as negociações com o Conselho e a Comissão.\nGostaria também de agradecer aos relatores de parecer das comissões competentes - a senhora deputada Laperrouze, pela Comissão da Indústria, da Investigação e da Energia, e o senhor deputado Schwab, pela Comissão do Mercado Interno e da Protecção do Consumidor - que participaram com base no processo de cooperação reforçada. Os pareceres adoptados por estas duas comissões complementaram e reforçaram de facto a proposta, tornando-a mais eficaz e simples para os consumidores finais: refiro-me aos consumidores, às empresas, associações de comércio, autoridades de supervisão e Estados-Membros. Gostaria de mencionar o excelente trabalho desenvolvido pelos funcionários do Parlamento e dos grupos que nos deram assistência nesta tarefa, bem como pelos representantes da Comissão e do Conselho.\nAo longo dos últimos meses, todos nós trabalhámos no mesmo sentido, tentando reduzir ao máximo o número de alterações e chegar a um consenso relativamente a determinados compromissos. Após dois meses de discussões técnicas tripartidas com as outras instituições, chegámos a um pacote de compromisso satisfatório com o Conselho, aprovado pelo COREPER em 27 de Junho último e que, se a votação de hoje for positiva, nos permitirá concluir o dossiê em primeira leitura.\nCom esta nova legislação, precisamos, por um lado, de manter os compromissos que assumimos a nível internacional - e dessa forma garantir uma coerência em termos de conteúdos entre o GHS das Nações Unidas e a nossa própria legislação - e, por outro, respeitar imperiosamente os actuais prazos previstos pela nossa própria legislação no âmbito do REACH.\nEsta nova regulamentação dar-nos-á a possibilidade de, em simultâneo, oferecer uma melhor protecção aos utilizadores destas substâncias e tornar as nossas empresas mais competitivas e eficientes. Com estas novas regras, idênticas em toda a parte do mundo, o mesmo produto não poderá ser considerado mais, ou menos, nocivo de país para país. Até agora não tem sido assim. Não só é ilógico, dado que a mesma substância apresenta os mesmos riscos onde quer que seja, como é extremamente perigoso quando estes produtos são exportados de um país para outro e acabam sendo consumidos por pessoas que não têm noção da perigosidade do produto que consomem.\nCreio, por conseguinte, não só para os utilizadores como para os trabalhadores deste sector, em especial num número extremamente elevado de pequenas e médias empresas, que a nossa proposta poderá ser uma resposta útil para todos os nossos cidadãos e para todos os europeus, assim como para os cidadãos de todo o mundo.\nAnne Laperrouze\nSenhora Presidente, Senhor Comissário, Senhoras e Senhores Deputados, antes de mais, gostaria de agradecer à senhora deputada Sartori, a nossa relatora, e aos relatores-sombra dos outros grupos. Penso que o trabalho que realizámos, que não foi fácil, com um texto de 2 000 páginas, introduziu verdadeiros progressos.\nFalarei primeiro em nome da Comissão da Indústria, da Investigação e da Energia, da qual fui relatora de parecer, e depois em nome do meu grupo político.\nA Comissão da Indústria adoptou diversas alterações, de entre as quais passo a destacar a mais importantes.\nA situação das PME deve de ser tida em linha de conta: elas manifestaram o seu interesse por este assunto durante a consulta preliminar realizada pela Comissão. De um universo de 360 empresas, 45% - que empregam menos de 250 trabalhadores - responderam a esta consulta através da Internet realizada pela Comissão entre os dias 21 de Agosto e 21 de Outubro de 2006.\nA nossa comissão fez questão de salientar que, para além da prestação da informação necessária, o GHS visa também proteger os consumidores e o ambiente. A nossa comissão apelou ao Estados-Membros para que introduzam um procedimento que ajude os fornecedores, em particular as PME, em determinados sectores de produção, a estabelecer a classificação adequada e a rotulagem e embalagem destas substâncias e misturas.\nA nossa comissão pugnou igualmente pela coerência com o REACH, tendo por isso apresentado alterações relacionadas com a tonelagem.\nFinalmente, para além do desejo de evitar a duplicação com disposições legislativas em matéria de embalagem, a nossa comissão achou conveniente prever a eventualidade de litígios quanto à interpretação dos requisitos do regulamento, neste caso entre o fornecedor e um Estado-Membro, e a necessidade de um procedimento para garantir uma classificação harmonizada.\nFalando agora na qualidade de relatora-sombra do Grupo ALDE, passo a indicar alguns dos princípios que nortearam a nossa abordagem.\nÉ evidente que saudamos esta iniciativa. Uma abordagem mundial é totalmente coerente com o objectivo de garantir uma protecção acrescida da saúde e do ambiente, bem como a comercialização dos produtos.\nUma vez que se trata de um sistema mundial, é importante que o futuro regulamento não imponha às empresas europeias restrições às quais as suas concorrentes internacionais não estejam sujeitas. É desejável que a proposta seja coerente com o REACH, tanto no que se refere aos prazos e à abordagem baseada na tonelagem como no que respeita aos anexos, em particular o anexo 6.\nNo que diz respeito às informações afixadas no produto acabado, uma vez que a Comissão optou por incluir o segmento pós produção, a regra que deve prevalecer é a da qualidade e pertinência da informação e não a da quantidade de informação. O nosso grupo considerou importante reconhecer a existência e o valor de outras fontes de informação, sobretudo as PME e a indústria, mas também a importância de instrumentos de comunicação como a Internet. A confidencialidade de algumas informações deve também ser protegida. Por último, esta legislação não pode conduzir a um aumento dos ensaios em animais.\nTendo em conta o calendário apertado e a complexidade dos anexos, relembro que os deputados decidiram não os alterar, com o objectivo, também, de facilitar as negociações. Esta foi uma concessão importante por parte do Parlamento. No entanto, apercebemo-nos, neste caso, de que um destes anexos apresenta um grave problema de conformidade imediata e de aplicação para as indústrias em causa.\nO anexo VI é uma lista de substâncias com classificações harmonizadas a nível europeu. No entanto, já existe uma lista semelhante, lista essa que a indústria utiliza para classificar e rotular as misturas. Porém, quando a transferência teve lugar foram introduzidas modificações nessa lista e ela tem ser aplicada imediatamente após a entrada vigor do GHS, enquanto no caso das adaptações técnicas o prazo é de pelo menos 18 meses.\nMuitas PME estão preocupadas com esta mudança. É essencial que cheguemos a acordo com o Conselho em primeira leitura e que se ponha termo à publicação de disposições com a maior brevidade possível, para que a indústria e os utilizadores tenham tempo para se adaptarem ao novo sistema e para o tornarem operacional até ao final de 2008.\nPor conseguinte, peço à Comissão que apresente uma solução que confira à indústria tempo suficiente para se pôr em conformidade com os requisitos do regulamento, sem sofrer um impacto desproporcionado.\nApós o trílogo, e salvo o problema com o anexo, o texto submetido à votação parece-me ser um bom texto. Gostaria apenas de realçar alguns pontos relevantes. Falámos muito das PBT. Estas substâncias não são cobertas pelo GHS das Nações Unidas. O Parlamento conseguiu que a Comissão Europeia se comprometesse a insistir na sua classificação a nível das Nações Unidas. O Parlamento conseguiu igualmente eliminar a divisão da categoria \"irritação ocular\" em subcategorias, o que teria sem dúvida conduzido a um aumento do número de ensaios em animais, sem oferecer qualquer verdadeira mais-valia. Convém assinalar também que os ensaios em seres humanos para efeitos deste regulamento são proibidos, e que o GHS das Nações Unidas é um processo dinâmico; foi encontrado um mecanismo que permite que as futuras evoluções do GHS das Nações Unidas sejam tidas pelo GHS europeu. A confidencialidade é protegida de uma forma equilibrada.\nA coerência com o REACH é garantida, e o Parlamento aceitou um limiar zero para o inventário e a notificação, embora inicialmente quisesse um limiar de uma tonelada para certas categorias de produtos. Este limiar zero foi aceite porque as substâncias e misturas exclusivamente destinadas a actividades de I&D foram excluídas do âmbito de aplicação do regulamento.\nPenso que realizámos um bom trabalho, e tenho esperança numa boa votação e numa adequada aplicação do GHS.\nAndreas Schwab\nrelator de parecer da Comissão do Mercado Interno e da Protecção dos Consumidores. - (DE) Senhora Presidente, Senhor Comissário, Senhoras e Senhores Deputados, em primeiro lugar, gostaria de dizer que foi com grande satisfação que a Comissão do Mercado Interno e da Protecção dos Consumidores tomou conhecimento do compromisso apresentado pela senhora deputada Sartori em nome da Comissão do Ambiente, da Saúde Pública e da Segurança Alimentar. Cremos que, com esta solução, encontrámos um excelente compromisso e uma excelente solução, tanto para as empresas do sector químico no mercado interno europeu - a maioria das quais opera a nível mundial - como para os consumidores, e acreditamos ter obtido também um muito bom compromisso para os consumidores com especial sensibilidade a estas substâncias.\nIsto só foi possível graças à amistosa e persistente cooperação entre os relatores. Gostaria em especial de agradecer à senhora deputada Sartori a forma como conduziu as negociações - inclusive no trílogo -, pois, em última análise, não restam dúvidas de que a sua postura foi decisiva para encontrar uma solução que respondeu a todas as expectativas.\nEstou satisfeito com o resultado, pois creio que, do ponto de vista do mercado interno e das empresas - em especial as empresas do sector químico, cuja experiência no âmbito do REACH no plano europeu nem sempre foi completamente positiva -, o Sistema Mundial Harmonizado de Classificação e Rotulagem de Produtos Químicos (GHS), enquanto guia universal criado pelas Nações Unidas, pode ser implementado no mercado interno europeu de uma forma muito pouco burocrática e com uma orientação prática. Isto proporcionará vantagens competitivas directas no mercado interno europeu para as empresas que operam neste mercado, pois a rotulagem harmonizada é um avanço significativo comparativamente à regulamentação em vigor, que ainda varia nalgumas zonas periféricas.\nSenhor Comissário, nos debates no âmbito do trílogo, também abordámos brevemente o facto de a legislação sobre o transporte destes bens de consumo ainda não ter sido harmonizada, pelo que valeria a pena ponderar se, nos próximos meses, não deveríamos focar a nossa atenção na legislação sobre o transporte de produtos químicos.\nEm segundo lugar, não abrir os anexos foi a decisão certa - e, neste ponto, queria apoiar a senhora deputada Laperrouze, do Grupo da Aliança dos Democratas e Liberais pela Europa, com quem também mantivemos uma excelente cooperação -, já que essa atitude nos permitiu evitar que a discussão se convertesse numa discussão semelhante à que tivemos relativamente ao REACH. Embora isso tenha significado que alguns pontos específicos, que gostaríamos de ter melhorado, tivessem de ficar de fora, a verdade é que, com a sabedoria de quem só tem de olhar para trás, esse foi, de facto, o caminho certo a seguir.\nGostaria, no entanto, de manifestar o meu total apoio ao desejo expresso pela senhora deputada Laperrouze de criar um prazo transitório no Anexo 6 para as substâncias que foram alteradas nesse anexo, pois, quando iniciámos as consultas, não podíamos prever que as mesmas não seriam abrangidas pela solução que havíamos acordado. Senhor Comissário, ficaria muito grato se pudesse comentar brevemente esta questão na sua resposta.\nOs utilizadores de bens de consumo químicos não estão, regra geral, familiarizados com a composição dos mesmos. Por isso, nas discussões sobre o GHS, atribuímos especial importância à sua implementação, de modo a que fosse prático para os consumidores. Embora não tenha sido possível considerar cada caso individual em pormenor, encontrámos uma solução - pelo menos para os bens de consumo mais comuns, como o detergente em pó e os detergentes em geral - que permite aos consumidores conhecerem as quantidades de substâncias químicas contidas nesses produtos e, ao mesmo tempo, continuar utilizá-los no futuro como o faziam no passado.\nTalvez possa dar-vos um exemplo: anteriormente, apenas era possível utilizar detergentes líquidos fornecidos em grandes frascos que continham vários litros. A existência de tecnologias cada vez mais respeitadoras do ambiente no fabrico e na utilização destes produtos permitiu que a quantidade de detergente líquido necessária fosse sendo mais e mais reduzida, de modo que, agora, os maiores recipientes encontrados nas cozinhas são de apenas 300 ml ou 500 ml.\nSem dúvida que a concentração das substâncias químicas presentes nestes produtos aumentou, mas, para os consumidores, isto é compatível com a actual solução GHS, pois sabemos que as pessoas utilizam estes produtos todos os dias, pelo que não precisámos de os submeter a uma classificação excessiva.\nCom isto, abordei todos os pontos relevantes para o mercado interno. Obrigado pela vossa atenção.\nGuido Sacconi\nSenhora Presidente, Senhoras e Senhores Deputados, numa situação como esta, em que estamos todos de acordo, o nosso debate corre o risco de se tornar repetitivo. Pela minha parte, gostaria de referir três breves questões de natureza política, uma vez que subscrevo inteiramente as palavras dos meus colegas.\nA primeira questão prende-se, naturalmente, com o reconhecimento pela perseverança que a relatora demonstrou desde o início. Desde as primeiras reuniões que demonstrou uma firme determinação política em concluir este dossiê em primeira leitura e a verdade é que quase nos pegou pelos cabelos e forçou-nos a fazê-lo. Contudo, todos nós ficamos convencidos da necessidade de o fazer se de facto queremos introduzir rapidamente legislação que nos permita obter uma classificação imediata de todas as substâncias e dar realmente um passo em frente rumo a normas mais estritas capazes de proteger a saúde do consumidor e - concordo com este ponto - a saúde dos trabalhadores que, em vários sectores, utilizam essas substâncias, sobretudo na realidade mais difícil da pequena empresa.\nEm segundo lugar, evitámos o perigo iminente de reabrir antigas discussões que haviam sido arquivadas com a adopção de REACH, o que considerava, devo dizer, extremamente importante. No plano internacional, creio que até o facto de REACH ser cada mais utilizado como um critério de referência a nível internacional por outros países, que o usam como modelo para adaptar a sua própria legislação, é extremamente satisfatório.\nDe qualquer das formas, as disposições relacionadas com a classificação de substâncias que estamos prestes a votar têm de ser adaptadas e integradas de modo a corresponderem à regulamentação principal em matéria de classificação, rotulagem e embalagem de substâncias e misturas, sem acrescentar quaisquer elementos novos.\nQuer isto dizer, em última análise, como todos os meus colegas saberão, que o GHS não é a última palavra sobre o assunto da classificação e rotulagem de substâncias. Discutiu-se muito sobre a PDT. Não podemos esquecer que se trata de um processo em curso. Por agora o que está em questão é implementar o que já temos e classificar as substâncias que já foram objecto de uma análise de risco por parte das Nações Unidas. Mal tenhamos novas categorias de risco e resultados de novos estudos, a GHS será actualizada em conformidade, logo este é um processo que continua.\nLiam Aylward\nSenhora Presidente, o ambiente e a saúde pública têm repercussões na vida de todos os cidadãos e esta legislação está directamente relacionada com ambos. O Parlamento votou a favor do sistema REACH agora em vigor, que protege a saúde humana e o ambiente dos perigos derivados das substâncias químicas. O REACH visa garantir que fabricantes e importadores procedem ao registo, avaliação e classificação das substâncias químicas. Parte essencial do sistema consiste em informar devidamente o público através da rotulagem dessas substâncias.\nNão posso senão louvar esta legislação e o senhor Comissário por colocarem o sistema europeu ao nível do GHS (Sistema Harmonizado a Nível Mundial para a Classificação e Rotulagem de produtos químicos) das Nações Unidas. Os cidadãos serão informados dos perigos das substâncias químicas por pictogramas que indicarão o risco de explosão, fogo, cancro ou veneno. Também a indústria sairá beneficiada, já que os países de todo o mundo aceitam o sistema GHS. E o público terá mais confiança nas substâncias químicas que estejam marcadas com sinais e rotuladas de forma clara e concisa.\nCarl Schlyter\nem nome do Grupo Verts/ALE. - (SV) Nós falamos imenso de tomar a iniciativa em matéria de alterações climáticas, mas, se tivéssemos de facto uma abordagem holística no domínio das questões ambientais, teríamos copiado directamente a legislação da ONU também neste ponto. Agora vamos eliminar a toxicidade aguda da categoria 5. Por que motivo fazemos isso? Bom, pela bizarra razão de que haveria um aumento do número de substâncias a classificar e rotular, caso o não fizéssemos. Assim, a razão nada tem que ver com qualquer tipo de lógica ambiental ou de saúde. Não, nós não queremos copiar a categoria 5 porque isso significaria aumentar o número de substâncias, não obstante o propósito de tudo isto ser dispormos de uma norma comum global que facilite o comércio, e que, no caso vertente, seria igualmente benéfica nos planos ambiental e da informação aos consumidores. Lutei pela reintrodução da toxicidade aguda da categoria 5, mas infelizmente não tive sucesso.\nOutra questão em que estávamos atrasados e em que lográmos avançar com o Conselho, na realidade, era no embargar a proposta de redução do limiar de classificação de 10 kg. Gostaria de agradecer ao Conselho por se ter mantido firme na sua posição. A Comissão também deu um contributo positivo. Se a proposta tem vingado, o REACH ficaria posto em causa. O REACH destinava-se a avaliar químicos, averiguar se eles são perigosos e registá-los. Porém, o REACH avalia e regista apenas os 30 000 químicos mais utilizados, os de maior volume de consumo. Os restantes 70 000 químicos que usamos ficarão sob a alçada desta peça legislativa. Por esse motivo, é muito bom termo-la aprovado e sem fixar qualquer limite inferior para efeitos de classificação dos químicos. Se a proposta tivesse passado, o GHS deixaria de funcionar como complemento do REACH. Estou muito satisfeito por isso não ter acontecido e, como tal, estou em condições de apoiar o presente relatório.\nFolgo também com o facto de termos sido capazes de evitar uma divisão desnecessária em categorias para efeitos de realização de ensaios em animais, por exemplo em matéria de testes referentes a irritação ocular.\nCom estas duas vitórias asseguradas, posso votar a favor deste relatório. No entanto, faço questão de salientar que, não obstante não termos conseguido aqui e agora incluir os químicos muito perigosos PBT nem uma lista para avaliação prioritária, pelo menos conseguimos um texto que diz que promoveremos essas medidas no âmbito da ONU e que elas serão introduzidas no sistema da ONU. Agora, gostaria de ver a Comissão aplicar-se a fundo na prossecução desse objectivo, porque ele é muito importante. Senão, a nossa política em matéria de substâncias químicas constituirá um fracasso em toda a linha. É muito importante que as substâncias em causa sejam rapidamente incorporadas no sistema da ONU, na medida em que nós não fomos capazes de dar o primeiro passo aqui.\nQual é o resultado, então, para os consumidores? Não serão tão bem informados como poderiam ser a respeito dos perigos inerentes aos químicos, o que é decepcionante. Mas, ao menos, passam a ter uma norma decente e protecção básica contra os químicos perigosos. Portanto, o compromisso alcançado acaba por não satisfazer ninguém, o que no fundo é capaz de ser o desfecho habitual.\nAvril Doyle\nem nome do Grupo PPE-DE. - (EN) Senhora Presidente, as substâncias são uma parte importante e natural do nosso ambiente. Ainda que muitas vezes não pensemos no assunto, utilizamos substâncias químicas todos os dias. O mundo moderno não poderia funcionar sem elas. Mantêm os nossos produtos alimentares frescos, os nossos corpos limpos, ajudam as nossas plantas a crescer, alimentam os nossos carros. Quando usadas e geridas adequadamente, as substâncias químicas permitem-nos não só viver mais tempo como ter vidas mais saudáveis.\nA regulamentação proposta, que completa o REACH e alinha o sistema da UE de classificação, rotulagem e embalagem de substâncias e misturas com o GHS (sistema global harmonizado) das Nações Unidas, constitui uma proposta razoável e equilibrada.\nSe queremos fazer uso dos benefícios das substâncias químicas a um custo razoável, haverá então que aceitar a existência de riscos. Impõe-se portanto encontrar um equilíbrio entre riscos e benefícios e controlar os riscos das substâncias químicas por meio de rotulagem cuidada, de uma regulamentação baseada na ciência e de tecnologias inovadoras. Importa também encontrar um equilíbrio entre uma correcta implementação das obrigações internacionais da União Europeia subscritas no Conselho Económico e Social das Nações Unidas na Cimeira Mundial sobre Desenvolvimento Sustentável, realizada em Joanesburgo, em Setembro de 2002, e os encargos desnecessários que pendem sobre as empresas, e que temos de evitar, de uma rotulagem excessivamente exigente e infuncional.\nNesse sentido, apresentei várias alterações à proposta. Considero que é especialmente importante garantir que a classificação de produtos não induz em confusão os consumidores ou os prestadores de cuidados de saúde. Demasiada informação é igual a não informação. Razão por que apresentei uma alteração sobre a embalagem de produtos com formas irregulares, por exemplo, ou de pequenas dimensões, que tornam tecnicamente impossível a aposição de um rótulo. Nestes casos, a informação sobre os perigos contida no rótulo deve ser fornecida com rigor mas de outra maneira, recorrendo, por exemplo, a uma etiqueta solta apensa à embalagem.\nGostaria de agradecer muito especialmente à relatora, a senhora deputada Sartori, por apoiar as minhas alterações e pelo excelente trabalho que desenvolveu neste relatório.\nMuito embora a regulamentação existente em matéria de identificação e informação sobre as propriedades perigosas de substâncias químicas sejam semelhantes em muitos aspectos, existem diferenças suficientemente significativas que dão origem a uma classificação diferente, uma rotulagem e fichas de segurança (SDS) diferentes. O sistema global harmonizado (GHS) combinará, assim o esperamos, estas classificações diferentes de uma forma eficaz. Os benefícios da utilização de substâncias químicas excedem largamente os riscos, o que sucede sobretudo depois da introdução da legislação relativa ao registo, avaliação e autorização de substâncias químicas, conhecida por REACH.\nTemos de estar cientes de que os produtos químicos, ao longo das várias fases, que vão desde a sua produção ao seu manuseamento, transporte e utilização, podem representar potenciais riscos para a saúde humana e para o ambiente. Neste contexto, esperemos que o acordo ONU-UE sobre o GHS represente uma melhoria em matéria de protecção da saúde humana e ambiental e proporcione também maior clareza às empresas, em especial às envolvidas no comércio internacional.\nOs potenciais riscos, embora geríveis, que as substâncias químicas envolvem sublinham a necessidade de legislação que verse sobre uma abordagem globalmente harmonizada às questões da embalagem e rotulagem das substâncias químicas; regozijo-me pois com o facto de o Conselho e Parlamento terem acordado um texto, em 27 Junho, e gostaria de felicitar novamente a nossa relatora pelo trabalho que desenvolveu neste complexo mas importante dossiê.\nJens Holm\nem nome do Grupo GUE/NGL. - (SV) Aqueles que trabalham na produção de químicos vão ser afectados de forma particularmente severa. De acordo com um estudo realizado na Finlândia, na UE há 32 milhões de cidadãos que são diariamente sujeitos a exposição a químicos carcinogénicos no seu local de trabalho.\nTemos o dever de proibir os químicos mais perigosos e de controlar todos os químicos, em geral. Era esse, precisamente, o objectivo da legislação REACH, que aprovámos o ano passado. O resultado final do processo REACH é discutível. Eu próprio considerei que o texto acabou por ser enfraquecido e esfrangalhado por acção dos representantes dos interesses da indústria, mas ao menos passámos a ter uma peça legislativa, que é o regime em matéria de químicos de âmbito mais alargado do mundo.\nO GHS (Sistema Global Harmonizado de Classificação e Rotulagem de Substâncias Químicas) prolonga e complementa o sistema REACH. O GHS visa passar informação acerca dos químicos aos trabalhadores e consumidores. O propósito é classificar e rotular os milhares de substâncias e misturas que nos rodeiam. O GHS é, na realidade, uma Convenção da ONU que agora temos de aplicar a nível da UE. Depois de aprovado o GHS - infelizmente não antes de 2010 para as substâncias e apenas em 2015 para as misturas -, todos os químicos passarão a ser facilmente identificáveis. O que está em causa é proporcionar melhor informação aos milhões de trabalhadores que estão diariamente em contacto com químicos, aos consumidores que têm de ter como saber aquilo que compram. A rotulagem contribuirá igualmente para melhorar a situação em matéria de saúde pública em geral e de ambiente.\nA indústria poderá retirar benefícios da maior coerência da legislação, que facilitará o comércio internacional. Trata-se de um grande passo em frente e é por isso que nós, no Grupo Confederal da Esquerda Unitária Europeia/Esquerda Nórdica Verde, apoiamos este compromisso.\nContudo, é uma pena que tenhamos ficado aquém daquilo que estava ao nosso alcance. As substâncias químicas persistentes, bioacumuláveis e tóxicas (PBT) não ficarão sujeitas a rotulagem. Por força deste compromisso, a questão das PBT será tratada no quadro da ONU. Trata-se de uma pecha grave do acordo. Porque não hão-de submeter-se as substâncias PBT ao mesmo regime de todas as outras e, como elas, ser rotuladas? Agora resta-nos esperar que outros países façam pressão na questão das PBT. Acredito que isso se venha verificar a longo prazo.\nNão obstante isso, estamos perante um bom compromisso, que permitirá que milhões de europeus, trabalhadores e consumidores, recebam mais informação acerca das dezenas de milhares de químicos que nos rodeiam. Esta é uma decisão da maior relevância para todos aqueles que padecem de cancro, alergias ou doenças cutâneas imputáveis à acção de substâncias químicas.\nGraham Booth\nem nome do Grupo IND/DEM. - (EN) Senhora Presidente, com o Regulamento REACH a começar agora a minar a indústria de produção, especialmente, em relação às pequenas e médias empresas, para além do número de ensaios em animais a aumentar vertiginosamente, aqui temos, sob a forma de um, mais algumas instruções dos zelotes da governação mundial da UNESCO sobre como classificar, rotular e embalar os resultados da sua ideia anterior.\nSendo igualmente sedentos do domínio global anti-democrático, a elite comercial e política que constitui a União Europeia apressa-se a implementar estas instruções, tal como o fizeram para implementar o regulamento REACH. Fizeram uma bateria de garantias sobre as suas boas intenções que poderão, por agora, proteger ou iludir as chamadas partes interessadas, mas que não satisfarão o grande número de desempregados que estas medidas já começam a produzir.\nUmas migalhas de reconhecimento pela opinião pública caem da mesa do Mestre, sob a forma de alterações 10, 12, 39 e 42, destinadas a colocar, em certas circunstâncias, a redução dos ensaios em animais à frente do cumprimento da letra da lei. Sei que isto se deve à pressão de grupos de influência ecológicos, de cujo apoio a UE tanto depende, e de facto, colocar o bem-estar dos primatas não humanos acima do dos humanos, como manifestado na alteração 40, vai seguramente pacificá-los; porém, encontrar alguma coisa que mereça um voto positivo no processo opressivo e obsessivo da legislação da UE é uma raridade digna de nota.\nQuanto ao resto, não há razão para que normas sensatas de segurança não devam ser adoptadas voluntariamente por Estados-nação democráticos com poderes judiciais independentes e acesso livre do público aos sistemas judiciários. Decretos supranacionais poderão parecer uma opção fácil, mas o poder centralizado arbitrário para que contribuem, com directiva atrás de directiva não solicitada, não só é o seu próprio mal como também o seu principal efeito tenebroso.\nA afirmação feita no considerando 7 de que esta legislação proporcionará vantagens competitivas à indústria e, como a alteração 1 acrescenta, sobretudo às pequenas e médias empresas, é simplesmente absurda. Como sempre, os grandes senhores de negócios da UE beneficiarão do fracasso dos seus pequenos concorrentes. Tornar-se-ão ainda um peixe maior num tanque mais pequeno ou então fogem para o estrangeiro e, em vez de fazer vénias à UE e às suas ridículas restrições, os comerciantes internacionais estabelecerão relações comerciais muito mais lucrativas uns com os outros do que connosco. A expansão está no fim. A recessão começou e sob a carga da regulamentação da UE, como por exemplo o relatório, as nossas economias afundar-se-ão como pedras.\nTodos os que têm este \"tacho” podem dizer ao seu eleitorado o que entenderem na sua própria língua sem receio de as pessoas virem a escutar o que os colegas dizem aos seus eleitores noutros Estados. Não há um eleitorado geral da UE e não poderá haver a não ser daqui a um século ou dois, quando toda a gente falar a mesma língua, e até que esse tempo chegue, a democracia da UE será uma anedota, e uma anedota pura e simplesmente obscura e perigosa. Mas os vossos privilégios são enormes. Por que razão haveriam de se preocupar com isto ou com a legislação contraproducente que os Senhores continuamente aprovam sem pensar? E por que motivo devo preocupar-me, se vou passar à reforma no final deste mês? Quando li a alteração 28, compreendi por que razão já estou cansado de todo este disparate. Diz o seguinte: \"Preparação\", a mistura ou solução composta por duas ou mais substâncias; mistura e preparação são sinónimos”. Bem, como é que sobreviveríamos sem este Estado super protector que nos explica este tipo de coisas, e como é que foi possível eu ter sobrevivido até à bem madura idade de 68 anos, quando passei os meus primeiros tempos de vida a \"roer” a pintura com chumbo das grades de madeira da minha cama de bebé? Creio que deu alguma coisa que fazer aos meus anticorpos nos tempos em que ainda tínhamos anticorpos.\nCada decreto opressor faz com que o colapso da UE esteja mais perto. Regozijo-me por isso, mas lamento os danos que os Senhores infligem em 27 antigas democracias, ano atrás de ano desastroso.\nJim Allister\n(EN) Senhora Presidente, faz-me todo o sentido que, a partir do momento em que as substâncias químicas são fabricadas e comercializadas a nível global, a descrição dos perigos relativos à sua embalagem não deva ser diferente de país para país, na medida em que não só é prejudicial para os consumidores como representa uma desvantagem para àqueles que descrevem com rigor os perigos existentes.\nContudo, constato que, de momento, o sistema \"globalmente harmonizado” não é tão global quanto isso. É mais esporádico do que global. Pergunto-me se outros países seguirão, ou não, o exemplo da UE de abraçar este sistema das Nações Unidas, e qual poderá ser o impacto para as empresas na Europa se não o fizerem.\nAo implementar estas medidas, precisamos de encontrar um equilíbrio. Em primeiro lugar, é fundamental que não haja uma sobre-classificação de produtos, o que confundiria os consumidores e os prestadores de cuidados de saúde.\nEm segundo lugar, precisamos de implementar estas obrigações internacionais sem impor encargos desnecessários às nossas empresas. Houve uma série de empresas que manifestou preocupação sobre o custo da implementação. Haverá elevadas despesas ligadas à TI e à formação, bem como custos de reembalagem, que não podemos subestimar, especialmente no caso das pequenas empresas. Faço minhas as preocupações manifestas sobre a possibilidade de as PME poderem tornar-se vítimas deste sistema, sobretudo se tiverem relações comerciais a nível externo, sendo que estes custos poderão muito bem ser superiores ao que poderão suportar.\nEija-Riitta Korhola\n(FI) Senhora Presidente, o debate sobre o recente Regulamento do Conselho sobre produtos químicos, REACH, ainda está presente na nossa memória. Foi um dos pacotes legislativos mais difíceis desta legislatura. O regulamento relativo à classificação, rotulagem e embalagem de substâncias e misturas que temos agora em mãos assenta, em parte, no Regulamento REACH que acaba de entrar em vigor e complementa-o. Razão por que levantou previamente algumas questões.\nO desejo da Comissão de consecução de um acordo em primeira leitura parecia inicialmente demasiado ambicioso, tendo em conta que o Parlamento tinha indicado previamente o seu interesse na legislação sobre produtos químicos. Por isso, resta-me admirar o trabalho credível e a liderança da minha colega, a senhora deputada Sartori, relativamente a este relatório de carácter técnico, e a forma como conseguiu evitar a tentação de revisitar demasiadamente o regulamento e, por exemplo, incorporar novos números e classificações de substâncias nos anexos, que teriam atrasado e mesmo evitado a entrada em vigor do regulamento.\nO relatório que analisámos nas comissões conseguirá provavelmente atingir as metas fixadas pelo regulamento, especialmente no que se refere à harmonização e simplificação da legislação. O Sistema Mundial Harmonizado de Classificação e Rotulagem de Produtos Químicos (GHS) e o sistema REACH complementam-se mutuamente, e não servem apenas para facilitar o trabalho dos produtores e distribuidores de produtos químicos. Ao invés, uma rotulagem clara e segura significará um regresso à confiança dos consumidores nesses produtos.\nQuando o trabalho da comissão começou, as pessoas manifestaram preocupação com o facto de o Regulamento GHS significar também que um grande número de detergentes, por exemplo, teriam de ser classificados como corrosivos. Desta forma, por exemplo, agentes para desentupimento de canos e produtos de limpeza líquidos teriam a mesma classificação e rótulo de embalagem e, como resultado disso, os consumidores não conseguiriam distinguir entre produtos perigosos e detergentes mais suaves. Agora, porém, as classificações das substâncias reflectem, tão bem quanto se pode esperar, o seu real potencial de perigosidade.\nO objectivo deste sistema, assentando como assenta num acordo da ONU, é que sejam aplicados os mesmos critérios à classificação e rotulagem de químicos e à regulamentação relativa ao transporte, venda e utilização de produtos químicos em todo o mundo. Nos termos do acordo, o sistema ficaria totalmente operacional até 2008. Ainda temos alguns meses pela frente.\nGyula Hegyi\n(EN) Senhora Presidente, a harmonização global da classificação, rotulagem e embalagem de substâncias e misturas é bem-vinda, e considero que a Europa deve ter um papel de liderança na protecção dos nossos cidadãos contra substâncias químicas perigosas. Toda a iniciativa tem origem nas Nações Unidas, sendo pois um projecto global. O sistema global harmonizado constitui um sinal promissor de cooperação global em questões ambientais. Esse o motivo por que apoio a adopção do compromisso relativo ao relatório Sartori.\nApresentei mais de 20 alterações a fim de assegurar a rotulagem adequada e a utilização segura de substâncias químicas. Dezassete dessas alterações foram aprovadas pela Comissão do Ambiente, da Saúde Pública e da Segurança Alimentar. Contudo, a mesma comissão para o ambiente também adoptou várias alterações apresentadas pela relatora que enfraqueceriam os direitos dos consumidores no que se refere à informação sobre os perigos das substâncias químicas nos produtos.\nO Grupo Socialista e eu votámos contra essas propostas porque os interesses dos consumidores são fundamentais para nós. Apraz-me que o novo compromisso não inclua estas alterações anti-consumidor, pelo que proponho a aceitação do mesmo. Não que esteja absolutamente satisfeito com o compromisso alcançado, mas não podemos atrasar a integração do GHS na nossa legislação.\nAceitemos, como um princípio de base, que as empresas não deverão invocar a confidencialidade comercial quando colocam substâncias químicas perigosas no mercado. No que se refere aos perigos, os consumidores têm direito a dispor de toda a informação necessária.\nObviamente que o problema está nos pormenores, portanto veremos como é que o GHS funcionará na prática, como é que indústria indicará nos produtos os sinais de perigo e se os consumidores compreendem, ou não, os sinais e avisos. A informação deverá ser clara e de fácil compreensão. Em suma, espero que o GHS venha a ser um bom instrumento para apresentar o resultado do REACH ao público, de modo a que os consumidores se possam sentir muito mais confiantes relativamente às substâncias químicas, o que também ajudará a nossa indústria.\nO meu assistente Gergely Simon, que trabalhou largamente neste e noutros dossiês, deixará o Parlamento num futuro próximo. Gostaria de lhe agradecer a sua contribuição para o nosso objectivo comum, a saber, uma Europa mais segura do ponto de vista das substâncias químicas.\nHiltrud Breyer\n(DE) Senhora Presidente, todos sabemos que as substâncias químicas são produzidas e comercializadas em todo o mundo e que os perigos e os riscos também são globais. Por isso, necessitamos de directrizes sob a forma de classificações e de rótulos claros que se apliquem à escala global. Gostaria que a União Europeia fosse a locomotiva que conduzisse uma rotulagem muito clara e uma forte protecção dos consumidores, mas ouvi aqui muitos intervenientes no debate dizerem que em vez de ser a locomotiva, a UE deveria ir sentada no vagão freio.\nConsigo viver com este acordo político, mas não estou muito satisfeita com ele. É verdade, conseguimos dar um passo importante na via de uma maior segurança para as pessoas e para o ambiente. Também me deixa satisfeita o facto de, apesar do relatório da Comissão do Ambiente, da Saúde Pública e da Segurança Alimentar relativo a valores-limiar para a rotulagem, que era demasiado favorável ao sector industrial - os volumes dos dados utilizados para a classificação deviam ter sido incluídos no rótulo -, termos conseguido limitar os malefícios nas negociações com o Conselho e a Comissão. Apraz-me que já não haja valores-limiar para o requisito da rotulagem e também já não sejam aceites mais falhas no sistema para a indústria e que o sistema de classificação proposto redireccione o enfoque para alternativas às experiências realizadas em animais.\nNo entanto, gostaria de ter visto melhorada a rotulagem de substâncias persistentes, bioacumulativas e tóxicas e de ter visto ser criada uma nova categoria de \"toxicidade aguda\", porque esse é um assunto extremamente actual, relativamente ao qual devíamos ter disponibilidade para tomar medidas. Considero que hoje enviámos um sinal importante no que respeita a maior segurança para as pessoas e o ambiente, mas não podemos descansar sobre os nossos próprios louros. Como é evidente, esta questão vai dar-nos muito que fazer no futuro, porque há muita coisa que pode ser melhorada.\nJean-Claude Martinez\n(FR) Senhora Presidente, já existem normas contabilísticas mundiais harmonizadas, normas alimentares globais do Codex Alimentarus, normas fiscais globais e convenções-modelo da ONU sobre dupla tributação. Agora vamos ter também normas globais em matéria de rotulagem, classificação, embalagem e tonelagem de substâncias químicas.\nA legislação mundial de 2002 do Conselho Económico e Social das Nações Unidas - o sistema geral harmonizado -está a ser transposta para o direito comunitário.\nNão há dúvida de que esta harmonização mundial é útil para todos - consumidores, utilizadores, PME -, mas, para além destas 2 000 páginas e dos procedimentos, anexos e listas, o regulamento mostra que a normalização europeia não é suficiente para lidar com problemas globalizados. Problemas globais carecem de soluções globais, o que significa que o Primeiro-Ministro britânico, Gordon Brown, tem razão: entre o nível da ONU e o nível global, o nível europeu está a ficar cada vez mais ultrapassado, obsoleto e, em última instância, inútil.\nZuzana Roithová\n(CS) Senhoras e Senhores Deputados, deixou de ser aceitável que estejam em vigor no mercado europeu único legislações nacionais relativas ao comércio, em particular, de substâncias perigosas, que são divergentes. A uniformização da classificação e da rotulagem de substâncias químicas e misturas perigosas constitui uma boa notícia para os consumidores, visto que a harmonização proposta melhora a protecção da sua saúde e do ambiente. Também é uma boa notícia para a competitividade da indústria europeia que este regulamento complexo relativo ao transporte, ao fornecimento e à utilização de substâncias perigosas não venha a ser aplicado apenas na União Europeia, mas também noutros países em todo o mundo, graças às recomendações das Nações Unidas.\nO regulamento está associado à REACH, mas também introduz classes e categorias de perigo. Os rótulos irão conter instruções para o manuseamento, assim como símbolos gráficos e pictogramas obrigatórios inteligíveis para as pessoas em todo o mundo. Os novos requisitos relativos à embalagem e aos fechos oferecerão protecção contra a abertura de recipientes por parte de crianças e também garantirão marcação para pessoas cegas. Os críticos advertem para os elevados custos relacionados com a re-rotulagem, a criação das chamadas \"fichas de segurança\" e a introdução de novas tecnologias de embalagem. No entanto, estou convencida de que estas despesas a curto prazo serão mais baixas do que as poupanças a longo prazo em custos resultantes da eliminação da actual rotulagem de produtos divergente em função do seu destino. O período de implementação, faseado entre 2010 e 2015, também atende suficientemente à indústria.\nAprecio muito o facto de a senhora deputada Amalia Sartori ter conseguido alcançar um excelente compromisso no Parlamento e também com o Conselho. Ela conseguiu uma grande melhoria e um equilíbrio, após muitos meses de discussão sobre as cláusulas da proposta da Comissão, e, por isso, faço um apelo para que adoptemos a proposta amanhã, na primeira leitura. É um exemplo do excelente trabalho realizado por relatores parlamentares, juntamente com as equipas do Conselho e da Comissão.\nGenowefa Grabowska\n(PL) Senhora Presidente, hoje estamos a discutir um regulamento muito importante que nasceu de um debate e, mais tarde, de uma decisão no quadro da ONU. Nesse debate, que culminou na adopção pelo Conselho Económico e Social de um sistema global harmonizado de classificação e rotulagem de substâncias químicas, todos os Estados-Membros, e não apenas a ONU, tiveram uma intervenção papel muito activa e relevante, em particular a União Europeia, e também a Comissão. Isso significa que o sistema a que se chegou é nosso, igualmente. Fazemos bem, pois, em adaptar agora os nossos regimes relativos à utilização de substâncias químicas ao dito sistema, assegurando concomitantemente, como é nosso desejo, a protecção dos nossos concidadãos - dos cidadãos da UE - e do nosso ambiente contra as consequências da utilização de substâncias perigosas, porque as presentes harmonização, classificação e rotulagem das substâncias perigosas visam melhorar o nível da protecção da saúde e, também, o estado do ambiente.\nA química afecta as pessoas da mesma forma em todo o mundo. Quando compramos um produto, não temos de saber o que ele contém. Mas devemos saber, contudo, que estamos a comprar um produto seguro. Devemos poder confiar no fabricante e no produto adquirido. Aqui, o nosso papel prende-se com a rotulagem, domínio em que continua a haver grandes discrepâncias. Um produto classificado como perigoso num estado é classificado como tóxico noutro, e como nocivo num terceiro.

Hopkins \nYick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886), was the first case where the United States Supreme Court  ruled that a law that is race-neutral on its face, but is administered in a prejudicial manner, is an infringement of the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n##Background\nThe immigration of Chinese to California began in 1850 at the beginning of the Gold Rush.  They soon began to branch out to jobs in agriculture and made up a large group of railroad workers.  As the Chinese became more successful, tensions with white Americans grew.  White Californians were wary of the cultural and ethnic differences.  The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first of many pieces of legislation put into place to keep people from China from entering the United States. The government of California endeavored to prevent Chinese immigrants from working by requiring certain permits that they could not obtain, and passed legislation to prevent naturalization.   Many turned to the laundry business, and in San Francisco about 89% of the laundry workers were of Chinese descent. It was often the only job they could find.\nIn 1880, the elected officials of the city of San Francisco passed an ordinance making it illegal to operate a laundry in a wooden building without a permit from the Board of Supervisors.  The ordinance conferred upon the Board of Supervisors the discretion to grant or withhold the permits. At the time, about 95% of the city's 320 laundries were operated in wooden buildings. Approximately two-thirds of those laundries were owned by Chinese people.  Although most of the city's wooden building laundry owners applied for a permit, only one permit was granted of the two hundred applications from any Chinese owner, while only one out of approximately eighty non-Chinese applicants were denied a permit.\nYick Wo (j=jik1 wo4), was a laundry facility owned by Lee Yick. Lee Yick immigrated to California in 1861.  After 22 years of managing the facility, provisions set out by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors said that he could not continue to run it in a wooden building.  He continued to operate his laundry and was convicted and fined ten dollars for violating the ordinance.  He sued for a writ of habeas corpus after he was imprisoned in default for having refused to pay the fine.\n##San Francisco ordinance\nOrder No. 156, passed May 26, 1880\n##Issue before the Court\nThe state argued that the ordinance was strictly one out of concern for safety, as laundries of the day often needed very hot stoves to boil water for laundry, and indeed laundry fires were not unknown and often resulted in the destruction of adjoining buildings as well.  The petitioner pointed out that prior to the new ordinance, the inspection and approval of laundries in wooden buildings had been left up to fire wardens.  Yick Wo's laundry had never failed an inspection for fire safety.  Moreover, the application of the prior law focused only on laundries in crowded areas of the city, while the new law was being enforced on isolated wooden buildings as well.  The law also ignored other wooden buildings where fires were common—even cooking stoves posed the same risk as those used for laundries.\n##Opinion of the Court\nThe Court, in a unanimous opinion written by Justice Matthews, found that the administration of the statute in question was discriminatory and that there was therefore no need to even consider whether the ordinance itself was lawful. Even though the Chinese laundry owners were usually not American citizens, the court ruled they were still entitled to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Matthews also noted that the court had previously ruled that it was acceptable to hold administrators of the law liable when they abused their authority. He denounced the law as an attempt to exclude Chinese from the laundry trade in San Francisco, and the court struck down the law, ordering dismissal of all charges against other laundry owners who had been jailed.\nThe Court held that while the law wasn't discriminatory, it had been applied with \"an evil eye and an unequal hand\" in singling out Chinese laundry business owner Lee Yick.\n##Legacy\nYick Wo had little application shortly after the decision. In fact, it was not long after that the Court developed the \"separate but equal\" doctrine in Plessy v. Ferguson, in practice allowing discriminatory treatment of African Americans. Yick Wo was never applied at the time to Jim Crow laws. However, by the 1950s, the Warren Court used the principle established in Yick Wo to strike down several attempts by states and municipalities in the Deep South to limit the political rights of blacks. Yick Wo has been cited in well over 150 Supreme Court cases since it was decided.\nYick Wo is cited in Hirabayashi v. United States to recognize that: \"Distinctions between citizens solely based because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality. For that reason, legislative classification or discrimination based on race alone has often been held to be a denial of equal protection.\" However, the US Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Gordon Hirabayashi, the Japanese American who tested the curfew law and refused to register for the forced internment of people of Japanese descent during World War II.\nIn San Francisco there is a public school named Yick Wo Alternative Elementary School in honor of Yick Wo.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "5e7b6719-eb18-4622-869e-8ce0b6662960", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "知识性：历史事件"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "2ebe440b-6882-426c-8507-6524ed137c0b", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "1 法律相关，通顺\n2 语法错误少"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "c0496773-c5b5-48f4-a81d-8972d6c7ebc7", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "上下文没有逻辑性"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "e3a32d81-d012-491b-bd16-83ef9dc0b811", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 陈述事实"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Different approaches have been taken for this problem. One approach is to move a lens and to capture a set of images as the lens moves, which cover a field of view over time. The images from the moved lens are combined to form panoramic scene. Another approach is to form an array of multiple different camera lenses and to combine the image results captured by the array of lenses into a single image. Still another is to utilize an ultra-wide angle lens (e.g., a fish-eye lens) to capture a scene with a wider-than-normal field of view. Yet another is to use a panoramic optical device to create a 360 degree horizontal field of view using a single shot (a discrete point of time using a single lens). This later approach is sometimes referred to as a “one-shot” panoramic device, which captures a panoramic scene in a single point in time using a single lens. Each of these approaches has benefits and drawbacks depending on use cases.\nWithin one-shot solutions that use panoramic optical components, a number of approaches have been taken depending on situation. Frequently, these components permit a single 360 degree image of an environment to be captured. Traditional panoramic one shot cameras place an inverted curved reflective surface in front of an image sensor, to reflect light before directing it to an image sensor.

In normal cells, autophagy is used to remove superfluous and damaged organelles and cytosolic proteins for degradation, serving as a surveillance mechanism and a survival strategy to maintain cell viability under stress conditions \\[[3](#CIT0003),[4](#CIT0004)\\]. Disruption of autophagy is involved in diverse human diseases \\[[5](#CIT0005),[6](#CIT0006)\\]. In cancer progression, autophagy plays dual roles, either as a tumor suppressor or promoting tumor progression \\[[7](#CIT0007)\\].\n\nVarious proteins participate in autophagy. BECN1 is a coiled-coil protein that interacts with BCL2 and is also a central component of the BECN1-PIK3C3-PIK3R4 complex which is indispensable for autophagy induction \\[[1](#CIT0001)\\]. BECN1 consists of 3 domains: BH3, coiled-coil domain (CCD) and BARA (the latter includes the ECD), and the roles of BECN1 in autophagy initiation depend on the proteins that bind to these domains \\[[1](#CIT0001),[8](#CIT0008)\\]. For example, the class Ⅲ phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) interacts with the CCD and ECD to form a complex with BECN1 \\[[9](#CIT0009)\\]. This complex increases the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) that favors phagophore elongation and allows the recruitment of ATG proteins to the phagophore \\[[1](#CIT0001)\\]. Thus, exploring the regulation mechanisms of BECN1 is important for us to reveal the mysteries of autophagy and its functions in human diseases.\n\nThe RBCC/TRIM (tripartite motif) proteins is a large family that contains an N-terminal ring domain, 1 or 2 B-box domains and a CCD \\[[10](#CIT0010)\\]. TRIM proteins participate in multiple cellular processes including cell proliferation, transcriptional regulation, immunity and cancer progression \\[[11](#CIT0011)--[14](#CIT0014)\\]. A series of studies indicated that many TRIM proteins are linked to autophagy \\[[15](#CIT0015)--[27](#CIT0027)\\]. Recently, several studies demonstrated that TRIM proteins can act as both autophagy cargo receptors and platforms assembling autophagosome-formation machinery. These TRIMs recruit ULK1 and BECN1 complexes and bind to mammalian Atg8-family paralogs via an LC3-interacting region, while recognizing cargo through the SPRY and potentially other domains \\[[26](#CIT0026),[27](#CIT0027)\\]. In our previous studies, we explored the potential roles of TRIM proteins in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by the mRNA expression profiling of all TRIM proteins in NSCLC cells \\[[28](#CIT0028)\\]. We identified TRIM59 as a potential tumor-promoting gene, but the precise molecular mechanism was obscure. TRIM59 has been reported to have oncogenic activity in mouse models and can be used as a multiple tumor marker for detecting early tumorigenesis \\[[29](#CIT0029),[30](#CIT0030)\\]. In gastric tumors, TRIM59 promotes gastric carcinogenesis through ubiquitinating and degrading TP53 \\[[11](#CIT0011)\\]. However, the role of TRIM59 in regulating autophagy has not been studied yet. In this study, we found an unexpected role of TRIM59 in autophagy regulation. The expression of TRIM59 was reciprocally correlated with BECN1 expression in NSCLC, and TRIM59 knockdown significantly increased the basal levels of autophagy in NSCLC cells. We discovered that TRIM59 could affect the transcription of the *BECN1* gene by negatively regulating the NFKB pathway. What is more intriguing was that TRIM59 could also regulate autophagy initiation through modulating TRAF6-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1. TRIM59 overexpression significantly reduced the TRAF6-induced ubiquitination of BECN1 and disturbed the formation of the BECN1-PIK3C3-PIK3R4 complex, whereas TRIM59 knockdown had an opposite effect. Further studies demonstrated that TRIM59 could directly ubiquitinate TRAF6 in a K48-linkage for proteasomal degradation. Thus, our studies point out a new role of TRIM59 in NSCLC cells and elucidate a novel mechanism of autophagy regulation.\n\nResults {#S0002}\n=======\n\nTRIM59 knockdown induces autophagy {#S0002-S2001}\n----------------------------------\n\nIn our previous study, we demonstrated that TRIM59 promoted the growth of non-small cell lung cancer \\[[28](#CIT0028)\\]. Here, we found an interesting phenomenon that the protein expression level of TRIM59 was inversely related to that of BECN1, an autophagy-related protein, in NSCLC tissues and cancer cells ([Figure 1(a, b)](#F0001)). This prompted us to explore if TRIM59 could affect autophagy. To detect the formation of autophagosomes, we transfected a plasmid encoding MAP1LC3B/LC3B (microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta) fused with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) into H1299 cells. As can be seen from [Figure 1c](#F0001) left panel, the GFP-LC3B puncta were significantly increased when TRIM59 was knocked down. The percentage of the cells with GFP-LC3B puncta increased significantly in TRIM59 knockdown cells compared with control H1299 cells ([Figure 1(c](#F0001)), right panel).10.1080/15548627.2018.1491493-F0001Figure 1.Knocking down TRIM59 induces autophagy. (**a**) Western blot analysis of the expression levels of BECN1 and TRIM59 in NSCLC tissues (top panel). BECN1 and TRIM59 expression relative to ACTB were quantified.

(**c**) H1299 cells stably expressing pEGFP-C2-LC3B (GFP-LC3B) were transiently transfected with *TRIM59* siRNAs. After 42 h, the cells were treated with or without 20 μM chloroquine (CQ) for 6 h and then analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus IX83). Scale bar: 10 μm (left panel). The cell numbers with GFP-LC3B puncta were counted under 200× magnification. \\*\\**P *≤ 0.01 (right panel). (**d**) TRIM59 was knocked down in H1299 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3B and treated with or without 20 μM chloroquine (CQ) for 6 h. The autophagy-related proteins were analyzed using the indicated antibodies.\n\nWe next assessed the expression levels of LC3-II and SQSTM1/p62 in TRIM59-silenced cells. As expected, the expression of the autophagosome-associated lipidated form, LC3-II, increased and the expression of SQSTM1 decreased when TRIM59 was knocked down ([Figure 1(d](#F0001))). As we know, autophagy is a highly dynamic process, and the accumulation of autophagosomes and LC3-II levels can be caused by either the induction of autophagy or the inhibition of autophagic flux \\[[31](#CIT0031)\\]. In order to discriminate between the 2 distinct mechanisms in our study, we used the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) to treat cells. As can be seen in [Figure 1(c](#F0001)), the percentage of the cells with LC3B puncta significantly increased when treated with CQ in both control and TRIM59-silenced cells. The expression of LC3-II also increased remarkably following CQ treatment compared with the CQ untreated group ([Figure 1(d](#F0001))). These data proved that TRIM59 knockdown promoted autophagy induction, not autophagy inhibition.\n\nTRIM59 affects the transcription of BECN1 through regulating the NFKB pathway {#S0002-S2002}\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs the expression of BECN1 was reciprocally correlated with TRIM59 ([Figure 1(a, b)](#F0001)), we presumed that TRIM59 affected autophagy by regulating the expression of BECN1. With the increasing expression of exogenous TRIM59 in H1299 cells, the expression of BECN1 decreased in a concentration dependent manner ([Figure 2(a](#F0002))). We next examined the effects of TRIM59 on the mRNA level of *BECN1*. Overexpression of TRIM59 decreased the *BECN1* mRNA level, and knocking down TRIM59 significantly increased the mRNA level of *BECN1* ([Figure 2(b, c)](#F0002)). These results indicated that TRIM59 might regulate the transcription of *BECN1*. We generated constructs with different fragments of the *BECN1* promoter region in the pGL3-enhancer vector and then performed a luciferase activity assay. From [Figure 2d](#F0002), we found that the promoter fragments + 1000 to −934 and + 500 to −934 showed higher activity than the others. We then detected the effects of TRIM59 on the activity of these promoter fragments. Overexpression of TRIM59 reduced the promoter activity of the + 1000 to −934 and + 500 to −934 fragments, whereas the + 1 to −934 and −500 to −934 fragments remained unchanged ([Figure 2(e](#F0002))). These results proved that the promoter region containing + 500 to + 1 might be important for TRIM59 to regulate the transcription of *BECN1*.10.1080/15548627.2018.1491493-F0002Figure 2.TRIM59 affects the transcription of *BECN1*. (**a**) H1299 cells were transfected with pCMV-HA-*TRIM59* (HA-*TRIM59*) with a gradual increase in the amounts of the plasmids. The expressions of BECN1 and exogenous TRIM59 were detected by western blot using anti-BECN1 and anti-HA antibodies. The BECN1 intensity was calculated by normalizing against ACTB. (**b**) The mRNA expression of *BECN1* and *TRIM59* in control and TRIM59-overexpressing conditions were determined by Q-PCR. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD). (**c**) The mRNA expression of *BECN1* and *TRIM59* in control (CTL) and TRIM59-silenced conditions were determined by Q-PCR. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD). (**d**) pGL3-enhancer vectors containing different fragments of the *BECN1* promoter and Renilla control plasmid were co-transfected into H1299 cells. The relative levels of luciferase activity were normalized to the levels of the + 1000 to −934 fragment and to the levels of luciferase activity of the Renilla control plasmid. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD). (**e**) pGL3-enhancer vectors containing different fragments of the *BECN1* promoter were transfected into H1299 cells, co-transfected with Renilla control plasmid and HA-*TRIM59* or empty vector. The relative levels of luciferase activity were normalized to the levels of the vector control and to the levels of luciferase activity of the Renilla control plasmid. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD). (**f**) pGL3-enhancer vector containing the + 500 to −130 region of the *BECN1* promoter were transfected into H1299 cells, co-transfected with Renilla control plasmid and pCMV-HA-*TRIM59* plasmid. The relative levels of luciferase activity were normalized to the levels of vector control and to the levels of luciferase activity of the Renilla control plasmid. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD). (**g**) pGL3-enhancer vector containing the + 500 to −130 region of the *BECN1* promoter were transfected into H1299 cells, co-transfected with Renilla control plasmid and control siRNA or *TRIM59* siRNAs. The relative levels of luciferase activity were normalized to the levels of control siRNA and to the levels of luciferase activity of the Renilla control plasmid. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD). (**h**) pGL3-enhancer vector containing the + 500 to −130 region of the *BECN1* promoter was transfected into H1299 cells, co-transfected with Renilla control plasmid and pcDNA3.0-*RELA* plasmid. The relative levels of luciferase activity were normalized to the levels of vector control and to the levels of luciferase activity of the Renilla control plasmid. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD). (**i**) pGL3-enhancer vector containing the + 500 to −130 region of the *BECN1* promoter was transfected into H1299 cells, co-transfected with Renilla control plasmid and control siRNA or *RELA* siRNAs. The relative levels of luciferase activity were normalized to the levels of control siRNA and to the levels of luciferase activity of the Renilla control plasmid. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD). (**j**) The pCMV-HA-*TRIM59* plasmid was transfected into H1299 cells. After 48 h, the expression of the indicated proteins was determined by western blot. The BECN1 intensity was calculated by normalizing against ACTB. (**k**) The control siRNA or *TRIM59* siRNAs were transfected into H1299 cells. After 48 h, the expression of the indicated proteins was determined by western blot. The BECN1 intensity was calculated by normalizing against ACTB.\n\nWe next inserted the promoter region containing + 500 to −130 into the pGL3-enhancer vector and performed a luciferase activity assay in TRIM59-overexpressing and TRIM59-silenced conditions. [Figure 2f](#F0002) and g show that the activity of this promoter region was sensitive to the expression level of TRIM59. The activity of this promoter fragment decreased when TRIM59 was overexpressed and increased when TRIM59 was knocked down. These results confirmed that TRIM59 regulated the transcription of *BECN1* through the + 500 to + 1 region of the *BECN1* promoter.\n\nBecause TRIM59 is not a transcription factor, we presumed that TRIM59 regulated the transcription of *BECN1* through modulating the activity of a certain transcription factor. By analysis of the promoter region in + 500 to + 1, we identified a RELA/p65 (a key subunit of NFKB) binding site: GGGGATTTCC, located in + 317 to + 308. We next detected the promoter activity of the + 500 to −130 fragment by modulating the expression of RELA. The promoter activity increased remarkably when RELA was overexpressed and decreased when RELA was knocked down ([Figure 2(h](#F0002), i)). Overexpressing RELA promoted the expression of BECN1, and knocking down RELA reduced the expression of BECN1 (Fig. S1A-S1D). These results demonstrated that RELA could regulate the transcription of *BECN1*. A similar result was also reported by Copetti *et al*. in 2009 \\[[32](#CIT0032)\\].\n\nWe next detected the effects of TRIM59 on the NFKB pathway and autophagy. Overexpression of TRIM59 blocked the activation of the NFKB pathway, as can be seen from the reduced expression of phosphorylated RELA and phosphorylated NFKBIA. ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) is an important regulator in the autophagy pathway, and the phosphorylation of ULK1 at Ser757 is closely related to the repression of autophagy induction \\[[33](#CIT0033)\\]. TRIM59 overexpression increased the expression of p-ULK1 (Ser757) and decreased the expression of LC3-II, indicating the repression of autophagy ([Figure 2(j](#F0002))), whereas TRIM59 knockdown activated the NFKB pathway and induced autophagy ([Figure 2(k](#F0002))). According to these results, we demonstrated that TRIM59 could affect the transcription of *BECN1* through regulating the NFKB pathway, and thus affected autophagy.\n\nTRIM59 affects the ubiquitination level of BECN1 {#S0002-S2003}\n------------------------------------------------\n\nAs TRIM59 possessed E3 ligase function \\[[11](#CIT0011)\\], we examined if TRIM59 could affect the stability of the BECN1 protein. We first tested the stability of BECN1 in physiological conditions by adding cycloheximide (CHX) to block protein translation in H1299 cells. The protein level of BECN1 decreased significantly when cells were treated with CHX for 6 h and this effect could be recovered by adding MG132, a proteasomal inhibitor, but not the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) ([Figure 3(a, b)](#F0003)). These results indicated that BECN1 was degraded via a proteasomal degradation pathway. To determine whether TRIM59 regulates the stability of BECN1, we examined the protein levels of BECN1 in the presence of CHX under TRIM59-overexpressing or -silenced conditions. [Figure 3c](#F0003) and d showed that TRIM59 did not affect the stability of BECN1. We next detected whether the ubiquitination of BECN1 was affected by TRIM59. Unexpectedly, the ubiquitination level of BECN1 was inversely related to TRIM59 expression levels. Knocking down TRIM59 remarkably increased the ubiquitination level of BECN1 and overexpressing TRIM59 had an opposite effect ([Figure (3e, f](#F0003)) and Fig. S2A, S2B). From these results, we concluded that TRIM59 did not affect the stability of the BECN1 protein through a proteasomal degradation pathway. However, TRIM59 strongly affected the ubiquitination level of BECN1 and these changes in ubiqutination did not influence the stability of the BECN1 protein.10.1080/15548627.2018.1491493-F0003Figure 3.TRIM59 affects the ubiquitination of BECN1. (**a**) H1299 cells were treated with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) for different times and the expression of BECN1 was detected by western blot (left panel). BECN1 expression relative to ACTB was quantified. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD) (right panel). (**b**) H1299 cells were treated with 25 μg/ml CHX alone or 25 μg/ml CHX plus 20 μM MG132 or 25 μg/ml CHX plus 20 μM chloroquine (CQ) for 9 h.

(**c**) H1299 cells were transfected with HA-*TRIM59*, treated with 25 μg/ml CHX for different time points and then immunoblotted with antibodies against HA, BECN1 and ACTB.

Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD) (right panel). (**d**) H1299 cells were transfected with control or *TRIM59* siRNA, treated with 25 μg/ml CHX for different time points and then immunoblotted with antibodies against TRIM59, BECN1 and ACTB.

(**e**) H1299 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding HA-*BECN1*, His-*UB* and with or without tGFP-*TRIM59*. After 42 h, the cells were treated with or without MG132 for 6 h. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody. The ubiquitination was detected using anti-UB antibody. Exogenous BECN1 and TRIM59 were detected using anti-HA and anti-tGFP antibodies. (**f**) H1299 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding HA-*BECN1*, His-*UB* and with or without *TRIM59* siRNA. After 42 h, the cells were treated with or without MG132 for 6 h. Then, proteins were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody, and the ubiquitination was detected using anti-UB antibody. The exogenous BECN1 and endogenous TRIM59 were detected using anti-HA and anti-TRIM59 antibodies.\n\nTRIM59 affects traf6-mediated ubiquitination of BECN1 {#S0002-S2004}\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that upregulating K63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1 promotes autophagy \\[[34](#CIT0034)\\]. According to our previous results in [Figure 3e and f](#F0003), we supposed that TRIM59 might also regulate autophagy through modifying K63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1. To test this hypothesis, we used a K63R mutant of ubiquitin to test its effects on the ubiquitination of BECN1 when TRIM59 was knocked down. [Figure 4a](#F0004) showed that the increased ubiquitination of BECN1 induced by TRIM59 knockdown was not observed when the wild-type ubiquitin was replaced with the K63R mutant. We used an antibody specific for K63-linked ubiquitin for western blot. The results revealed that TRIM59 knockdown significantly increased the K63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1 ([Figure 4(b](#F0004))). TRAF6 was reported to directly ubiquitinate BECN1 through a K63 linkage \\[[34](#CIT0034)\\]. In H1299 cells, we found that TRAF6 could bind to BECN1 ([Figure 4(c](#F0004))). Thus, we examined if TRIM59 affected TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination. We found that overexpression of TRAF6 increased the ubiquitination of BECN1, and overexpression of TRIM59 remarkably reduced the TRAF6-induced ubiquitination ([Figure 4(d](#F0004))). These results indicated that, except for the influence on the transcription of *BECN1*, TRIM59 might also affect autophagy through interfering with TRAF6 mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1.10.1080/15548627.2018.1491493-F0004Figure 4.TRIM59 inhibits TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination of BECN1.

FLAG-PIK3C3 and HA-BECN1 were detected using anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies. GFP-TRAF6 and tGFP-TRIM59 were detected with anti-GFP and anti-tGFP antibodies.\n\nWe wondered whether TRIM59-regulated TRAF6 induced autophagy. H1299 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3B were transfected with a plasmid encoding HA-*TRAF6* alone or co-transfected with HA-*TRAF6*- and HA-*TRIM59*-encoding plasmids. The autophagy induced by TRAF6 overexpression was greatly prohibited by TRIM59 overexpression. The cell numbers with GFP-LC3B puncta were increased when transfecting with a *TRAF6* plasmid alone, whereas a significant reduction was observed when the cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding *TRAF6* and *TRIM59* ([Figure 4(e](#F0004))). Overexpression of TRIM59 also decreased the expression of LC3B-II, whereas it increased SQSTM1 expression compared with overexpression of TRAF6 alone ([Figure 4(f](#F0004))).\n\nBECN1 plays a central role in autophagy through participating in the formation of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) complex \\[[1](#CIT0001)\\]. PIK3C3 is the catalytic subunit of PtdIns3K and interacts with BECN1 to form a complex when autophagy is induced. As TRIM59 could affect autophagy by modifying the ubiquitination of BECN1, we tested the effects of TRIM59 on the formation of the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex. From [Figure 4g](#F0004), we could see that TRIM59 knockdown enhanced the interaction between BECN1 and PIK3C3. However, overexpression of TRIM59 significantly reduced the PIK3C3 protein levels precipitated by HA-BECN1 and this effect was recovered by TRAF6 overexpression ([Figure 4h](#F0004)). These results demonstrated that TRIM59 could also affect autophagy through regulating the TRAF6-induced K63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1, thus modulating the formation of the PtdIns3K complex.\n\nTRIM59 regulates the degradation of TRAF6 by ubiquitination {#S0002-S2005}\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe already proved that TRIM59 could interfere with the E3 ubiquitin ligase function of TRAF6. An important question that needed to be answered was how TRIM59 regulated TRAF6. As shown in [Figure 5a](#F0005), knocking down TRIM59 apparently increased the expression of TRAF6. When the expression of exogenous TRIM59 increased, the expression of TRAF6 decreased in a concentration-dependent manner ([Figure 5(b](#F0005))). To investigate if TRIM59 affected the stability of TRAF6, we detected the stability of TRAF6 protein in physiological conditions by adding CHX for different times in H1299 cells. The expression of TRAF6 decreased significantly when treated with CHX for 3 h ([Figure 5(c](#F0005))) and the decreased expression of TRAF6 could be recovered by adding MG132, but not CQ (Fig. S3A). This observation indicated that TRAF6 protein was degraded in a proteasomal degradation pathway.10.1080/15548627.2018.1491493-F0005Figure 5.TRIM59 regulates the degradation of TRAF6 by ubiquitination. (**a**) TRIM59 was knocked down in H1299 cells and protein expression was detected using the indicated antibodies. (**b**) H1299 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding HA-*TRIM59* with gradually increasing the amount of the plasmid. The expression of TRAF6 and TRIM59 was detected by western blot using anti-TRAF6 and anti-HA antibodies. (**c**) H1299 cells were treated with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) for different times and the TRAF6 expression was detected by western blot (left panel). TRAF6 expression relative to ACTB was quantified. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD) (right panel). (**d**) H1299 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding HA-*TRIM59*, treated with 25 μg/ml CHX for different time points and then immunoblotted with antibodies against HA, TRAF6 and ACTB (left panel). TRAF6 expression relative to ACTB was quantified. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD) (right panel). (**e**) H1299 cells were transfected with control or *TRIM59* siRNA, treated with 25 μg/ml CHX for different time points and then immunoblotted with antibodies against TRIM59, TRAF6 and ACTB (left panel). TRAF6 expression relative to ACTB was quantified. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD) (right panel). (**f**) H1299 cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding HA-*TRAF6* and either tGFP-*TRIM59* or empty vector. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody and blotted with HA and tGFP antibodies. (**g**) The lysate of H1299 cells was immunoprecipitated using TRAF6 antibody or normal rabbit IgG, and blotted with TRAF6 and TRIM59 antibodies. (**h**) GST-TRIM59 purified with glutathione Sepharose beads was incubated with extracts from HA-TRAF6-transfected 293T cells. Western blot was performed to detect the indicated proteins using anti-HA and anti-GST antibodies. (**i**) H1299 cells were transfected with *TRIM59* siRNAs. After 42 h, the cells were treated with MG132 for 6 h. The lysates were immunoprecipitated using TRAF6 antibody and blotted with the indicated antibodies. (**j**) H1299 cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding His-*UB*, HA-*TRAF6* and either tGFP-*TRIM59* or empty vector. After 42 h, the cells were treated with or without MG132 for 6 h. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody. The ubiquitination was detected using an antibody specific for ubiquitin, and TRAF6 and TRIM59 were detected using anti-HA and anti-tGFP antibodies. (**k**) H1299 cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding His-*UB*, HA-*TRAF6* and either tGFP-*TRIM59* or empty vector. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody. The K48-linked ubiquitination was detected using an antibody specifically targeting ubiquitin that was K48 linked. TRAF6 and TRIM59 were detected using anti-HA and anti-tGFP antibodies. (**l**) The purified GST-TRIM59 was incubated with the indicated reaction component. The reaction mixture was subjected to western blot using antibodies against ubiquitin, Flag and GST.\n\nTo determine whether TRIM59 regulates the stability of TRAF6, we examined the protein levels of TRAF6 in the presence of CHX under TRIM59-overexpressing or -silenced conditions. [Figure 5d](#F0005) and e show that overexpression of TRIM59 accelerated the degradation rate of TRAF6, whereas knocking down TRIM59 stabilized the protein level of TRAF6. In order to figure out if TRIM59 could interacted with TRAF6, we performed co-immunoprecipitation and GST affinity isolation experiments and found that TRIM59 could bind to TRAF6 ([Figure 5(f](#F0005)-h) and Fig. S3B). As TRIM59 has an E3 ubiquitin ligase function, we detected the effect of TRIM59 on the ubiquitination of TRAF6. [Figure 5i](#F0005) showed that TRIM59 knockdown reduced the ubiquitination level of endogenous TRAF6. Overexpression of TRIM59 increased the ubiquitination level of TRAF6, whereas it decreased the protein expression of TRAF6, indicating the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of TRAF6 ([Figure 5j](#F0005)).\n\nTRAF6 was reported to possess both K48-linked and K63-linked ubiquitination \\[[35](#CIT0035)--[39](#CIT0039)\\], we next used ubiquitin mutants specific for K48 (K48R) or K63 (K63R) to check the changes in the ubiquitination level of TRAF6 induced by TRIM59. The increased ubiquitination levels of TRAF6 induced by TRIM59 overexpression was not observed when transfecting with a plasmid encoding the K48R mutant; however, the increased ubiquitination levels of TRAF6 could still be observed when transfecting with a plasmid encoding the K63R mutant, indicating that TRIM59 induced a K48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6 (Fig. S4A, S4B). We further examined these results using an antibody specific for K48-linked ubiquitination. [Figure 5k](#F0005) showed that the enhanced ubiquitination of TRAF6 induced by TRIM59 was indeed K48-linked. To provide evidence that TRIM59 directly ubiquitinated TRAF6, we performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay. As can be seen in [Figure 5l](#F0005), the polyubiquitin bands were observed when purified TRAF6 was added to the reaction system containing ubiquitin, UBA1/UBE1, UBE2D1, ATP and TRIM59. All these results pointed out that TRIM59 could directly regulate the degradation of TRAF6 in a ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation process.\n\nAs TRAF6 was originally described as an important regulator for the NFKB pathway \\[[40](#CIT0040),[41](#CIT0041)\\], we wanted to explore if the inhibition of BECN1 expression was also dependent on TRAF6 degradation induced by TRIM59. Figure S5A and S5B show that TRAF6 overexpression could not rescue the reduction of both the mRNA and protein level of *BECN1/*BECN1 triggered by TRIM59. These results demonstrated that TRIM59 affected the expression of BECN1 though a TRAF6-independent NFKB pathway.\n\nThe ring domain of TRIM59 is important for regulating traf6-induced autophagy {#S0002-S2006}\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe ring domain of TRIM family proteins has been shown to be essential for their protein degradation function \\[[10](#CIT0010),[11](#CIT0011)\\]. To get further insight into the mechanism for TRIM59 to ubiquitinate TRAF6, we constructed a TRIM59 mutant lacking the ring domain (ΔR). We found that this mutant could still interact with TRAF6 ([Figure 6(a](#F0006)[)]{.ul}). However, the mutant lost the ability to destabilize the TRAF6 protein ([Figure 6(b](#F0006))). Besides, the ability to ubiquitinate TRAF6 was also abolished ([Figure 6(c](#F0006))). These findings demonstrated that the ring domain of TRIM59 was important for the degradation of TRAF6.10.1080/15548627.2018.1491493-F0006Figure 6.The ring domain of TRIM59 is important for regulating TRAF6-induced autophagy. (**a**) H1299 cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding GFP-*TRAF6* and HA-*ΔR*. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody or normal mouse IgG, and blotted with HA and GFP antibodies. (**b**) H1299 cells were transfected with HA-*ΔR*, treated with 25 μg/ml CHX for different time points and then immunoblotted with antibodies against HA, TRAF6 and ACTB (left panel). TRAF6 expression relative to ACTB was quantified. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD) (right panel). (**c**) H1299 cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding His-*UB*, HA-*TRAF6* and either GFP-*ΔR* or empty vector. After 42 h, the cells were treated with or without MG132 for 6 h. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody. The ubiquitination was detected using an antibody specific for ubiquitin, and TRAF6 and ΔR were detected using anti-HA and anti-GFP antibodies. (**d**) H1299 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3B were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding HA-*TRAF6* and either HA-*ΔR* or empty vector. After 42 h, the cells were treated with or without 20 μM chloroquine (CQ) for 6 h. The autophagy-related proteins were analyzed by western blot.\n\nWe next detected the inhibitory effect of ΔR on the TRAF6-induced autophagy. In cells co-transfected with plasmids encoding TRAF6 and ΔR, the expression of LC3-II was not changed when compared with the cells transfected with the TRAF6 plasmid alone. Also, the expression levels of SQSTM1 were similar between these 2 groups ([Figure 6(d](#F0006))). In the group co-transfected with plasmids for HA-TRAF6 and HA-ΔR, the percentage of the cells with GFP-LC3B puncta was not changed significantly compared with the group transfected with the HA-TRAF6 plasmid alone (Fig. S6A). These data demonstrated that overexpressing ΔR did not block the autophagy process induced by TRAF6. Then, we tested the ubiquitination function of this mutant on BECN1. Overexpressing ΔR did not change the ubiquitination of BECN1, and the inhibitory effect of TRIM59 on autophagy was not observed for this mutant (Fig. S6B, S6C). Taken together, the ring domain of TRIM59 is important for regulating the ubiquitination of TRAF6 and the TRAF6-induced autophagy.\n\nBoth the transcription and the ubiquitination of BECN1 are necessary for the autophagy induced by TRIM59 knockdown {#S0002-S2007}\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs TRIM59 affects both the expression and the K63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1, we next wanted to examine whether both effects were necessary for autophagy induced by TRIM59 knockdown. *RELA* siRNAs were co-transfected with *TRIM59* siRNA into H1299 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3B. [Figure 7a](#F0007) showed that the GFP-LC3B puncta were significantly increased when TRIM59 was knocked down. In addition, the percentage of the cells with GFP-LC3B puncta increased significantly; however, knocking down RELA decreased the total GFP-LC3B puncta and the cell numbers with GFP-LC3B puncta. The expression of LC3-Ⅱ was increased when knocking down TRIM59, whereas knocking down RELA reversed these effects. In [Figure 7b](#F0007), *TRAF6* siRNAs were transfected into H1299 cells with TRIM59 knockdown. We discovered increased GFP-LC3B puncta and enhanced expression of LC3-II when TRIM59 was knocked down, whereas TRAF6 knockdown remarkably reduced the LC3B puncta and LC3-II expression induced by TRIM59 knockdown.10.1080/15548627.2018.1491493-F0007Figure 7.Both the transcription of *BECN1* and the ubiquitination of BECN1 are necessary for the autophagy induced by TRIM59 knockdown. (**a**) *TRIM59* siRNA was co-transfected with or without *RELA* siRNAs into H1299 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3B. After 48 h, the cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus IX83).

After 48 h, the cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus IX83). Scale bar: 10 μm (upper panel).

The expression of related proteins was examined by western blot (bottom panel).\n\nNoting that the expression level of BECN1 remained unchanged between the cells transfected with *TRIM59* siRNA and the cells co-transfected with *TRIM59* and *TRAF6* siRNAs, we proposed that both the expression and the ubiquitination of BECN1 were important for autophagy induction. To further demonstrate this, we overexpressed BECN1 in H1299 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3B with or without TRAF6 knockdown. We found that BECN1 overexpression strongly induced autophagy as determined by increased cell numbers with GFP-LC3B puncta and enhanced expression of LC3-II, whereas TRAF6 knockdown decreased the effects ([Figure 7(c](#F0007))). A previous study demonstrated that the Lys117 of BECN1 was the major ubiquitination site for K63-linkage and the Glu299 of BECN1 was important for the recruitment of TRAF6 to BECN1 \\[[34](#CIT0034)\\]. We then mutated these 2 residues of BECN1 and assessed the autophagy induction effects. As shown in Figure S7A-S7C, the autophagy induction effects for BECN1^K117R^ and BECN1^E299A^ were significantly attenuated compared with BECN1 wild-type. These results demonstrated that both the transcription and the ubiquitination of BECN1 were important for autophagy induced by TRIM59 knockdown.\n\nDiscussion {#S0003}\n==========\n\nBECN1 plays a central role in autophagy that triggers a cascade of proteins involved in autophagosome formation \\[[1](#CIT0001)\\]. The regulation of BECN1 can occur at the level of transcription, translation and post-translational modifications \\[[8](#CIT0008)\\]. At the transcription level, the transcription factor E2F1 and NFKB can bind to the promoter region of the *BECN1* gene to enhance transcription \\[[32](#CIT0032),[42](#CIT0042)\\]. However, another transcription factor, SMAD2, negatively regulates the transcription of *BECN1* and thus represses autophagy in endothelial cells \\[[43](#CIT0043)\\]. These studies demonstrate that modulating the expression of BECN1 is an important event in autophagy induction. In the current study, we found that the expression of TRIM59 and BECN1 were inversely correlated in NSCLC. Further studies demonstrated that TRIM59 repressed the transcription of *BECN1*. Although TRIM59 is not a transcription factor, it acted as a negative regulator of the NFKB pathway, and thus affected BECN1 expression. This was one of the mechanisms for TRIM59 to regulate autophagy determined in our study. TRIM59 has now been accepted as an important oncoprotein, and the molecular mechanisms for its tumor-promoting functions are very preliminary. Previous studies proved that TRIM59 could also affect the TP53 pathway, SMAD2/3 pathway and AKT pathway \\[[11](#CIT0011),[44](#CIT0044)--[46](#CIT0046)\\]. These findings together with ours indicated that TRIM59 has many profound functions including the effect on autophagy, and these functions are important for cancer progression.\n\nPost-translational modifications (PTMs) of BECN1 including phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination are essential for autophagy induction \\[[47](#CIT0047)\\]. Ubiquitination of BECN1 affects either its protein stability or functions. NEDD4 was reported to ubiquitinate BECN1 with a K11-linkage for proteasomal degradation when *PIK3C3/VPS34* is depleted \\[[48](#CIT0048)\\]. In another study, USP19 was reported to rescue the proteasomal degradation of BECN1 through removing the K11-linked ubiquitination \\[[49](#CIT0049)\\]. K63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1 is critical for TLR4-induced autophagy, and TRAF6 functions as an E3 ligase in this process \\[[34](#CIT0034)\\]. In our study, we found that except for the effect on the transcription of *BECN1*, TRIM59 knockdown induced autophagy accompanied by the upregulation of BECN1 ubiquitination. As TRIM59 functions as an E3 ligase, this result was in contrast with our initial idea that TRIM59 inhibited autophagy by ubiquitination and degradation of BECN1. What interesting results we found were that TRIM59 regulated K63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1 through direct ubiquitination and degradation of TRAF6, and the ring domain of TRIM59 was essential in this process. We finally demonstrated that both the transcriptional effects on *BECN1* by RELA and the binding of TRAF6 to BECN1 were essential for autophagy induced by TRIM59 knockdown. In conclusion, we discovered the dual roles of TRIM59 in autophagy regulation by regulating both the transcription and K63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1.\n\nUntil now, many studies have proved that TRIM proteins are associated with autophagy. The expression of TRIM55 parallels that of autophagy proteins NBR1, SQSTM1 and LC3 during cardiac myofibril assembly and turnover \\[[15](#CIT0015)\\]. TRIM30 localizes in cytoplasmic bodies with ubiquitin chains and the autophagy marker LC3, and is degraded through both proteasome and autophagy pathways \\[[16](#CIT0016)\\]. TRIM11 can act as a receptor to recruit AIM2 to SQSTM1 for selective autophagy degradation upon DNA virus infection \\[[17](#CIT0017)\\]. Another study demonstrated that TRIM23 is essential for autophagy in response to viral infection and a TRIM23-TBK1-SQSTM1 axis is a key component in selective autophagy \\[[18](#CIT0018)\\]. TRIM13 regulates the initiation of autophagy during ER stress and TRIM13-induced autophagy is essential for ER stress-induced caspase activation and cell death \\[[19](#CIT0019),[20](#CIT0020)\\]. The interaction between TRIM16 and LGALS3 orchestrates the recruitment of core autophagic factors and activates selective autophagy in response to damaged endomembranes \\[[21](#CIT0021)\\]. Besides, TRIM16 can also act as a receptor for IL1B and interact with SEC22B to recruit cargo to LC3-II-positive sequestration membrane in response to lysosomal damage, a process termed secretory autophagy \\[[22](#CIT0022)\\]. In ATG5- or ATG7-deficient cells, TRIM31 directly interacts with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in a palmitoylation-dependent manner, leading to the induction of autophagy. In this process, the B-box domain of TRIM31 is required for the formation of TRIM31-positive puncta and colocalization with PE \\[[23](#CIT0023)\\]. The E3 ubiquitin ligase complex of TRIM28 with its regulators MAGEA3 or MAGEA6 (MAGEA3/6-TRIM28) can target AMPK for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation, resulting in significantly reduced autophagy. However, in cells not expressing MAGEA3 or MAGEA6, TRIM28 functions as a pro-autophagy factor through sumoylating PIK3C3/VPS34 and promoting the formation of the PIK3C3-BECN1 complex \\[[24](#CIT0024)\\]. In another study, TRIM17 can inhibit certain types of selective autophagy by stabilizing the MCL1-BECN1 complex. However, TRIM17 can also promote the removal of midbodies through autophagy because of the absence of MCL1 from TRIM17-BECN1 complexes at midbodies \\[[25](#CIT0025)\\]. These 2 TRIM proteins (TRIM17 and TRIM28) further expand the roles of TRIM proteins in regulating autophagy by showing that a single TRIM can either positively or negatively regulate autophagy depending upon different conditions.\n\nA recent comprehensive analysis demonstrated that some TRIM proteins act as platforms assembling activated ULK1 and BECN1 to induce autophagy. Besides, TRIM5/TRIM5α can also act as an autophagy receptor by directly recognizing its cognate target without a need for ubiquitin tagging \\[[26](#CIT0026)\\]. Another comprehensive study demonstrated that a subset of TRIM proteins (such as MEFV/TRIM20 and TRIM21) function as regulators and receptors for autophagy-targeting components of the inflammasome and type Ⅰ IFN response systems \\[[27](#CIT0027)\\]. These studies demonstrate that the functions of TRIM proteins in autophagy induction are diverse and each TRIM protein may have a specific function in autophagosome formation, suggesting that a particular TRIM protein does not compensate for the function of other TRIM proteins in autophagy induction. Although the function of TRIM59 in cancer progression has been intensively studied, the role of TRIM59 in autophagy induction has not been clarified yet. Thus, our studies point out another new way for the TRIM proteins to regulate autophagy though regulating the transcription and modulating the post-translational modifications of autophagy-related proteins.\n\nMaterials and methods {#S0004}\n=====================\n\nCell culture and NSCLC patient samples {#S0004-S2001}\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines H1299, A549, H292, H358, H1975, H23, HCC827 from ATCC were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, C11875500BT), containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Excel, FCS100).

Is it necessary for the two commissioners to travel for the purpose of travelling to check the tailoring of the uniform? Or is it better for one to remain and be useful at home.\nCommissioner you have appointed a uniform committee as such why not pick one of the committee member and logistic and store staff instead of two most senior officers.\nWe question which fund have you allocated for the trip. To our understanding, in budget workshop last year there was no fund allocated for such trip.\nWe are reminding you commissioner to work your talk; you also talk about spending tax payers’ money wisely and in this case you are acting differently.\nOn the other hand should the trip be funded by Lotus Fiji, then we will be more suspicious.\nWe remember two years back Lotus funded a trip to Australia for Patrick Sale, Deputy Commissioner Operation, to travel under their expense.\nBooked in five star hotel, high allowance paid, comes home very satisfied but the uniform was not value for money. You ask every correctional officer and they will tell a story about the uniforms. Isn’t this a corruption that needs to be investigated?\nThere are very minor cases such as late for duty, absent for duties that are investigated and officers disciplined, why this matter can’t be investigated, there may be some secret behind such deal which commissioner is hiding.\nWhere is the adoption of best practices that commissioner Haisoma makes mentioned of every now and then?\nInstead, he is entertaining and facilitating bad practices or worse practices.\nIn the past when CSSI dealt with uniform, the dealers from grown agency (London) Collin Carr (New Zealand) normally come over to the country with samples, when the management agrees with the particular material, pattern, colour and it’s over.\nWhen tailoring is done consignment sent with no additional cost. Isn’t that a good practice that we should maintain?\nMr Commissioner your deputies are enjoying all the privileges that you have given them but we are questioning their capabilities.\nReporting very late to work, missing part of the day, gone in the afternoon never return. There is no quality leadership portrayed by your deputies.\nLet us remind you, commissioner that there are other capable officers beside them why not give them a try.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "0001579", "creator": "jinzhenjiang", "data_id": "66a07b0e-5f4b-4a13-ac64-8f685a443149", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "be3d1157-b9cc-49be-b39d-cc693dc74dac", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "1a5b24ec-9a9b-453d-b214-437e253105ad", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "aae3fd60-455a-4c33-8b15-7b21177a8098", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "113966", "creator": "chupei", "data_id": "1fd02c00-ab9d-40ee-a439-7460729e9f34", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "051560", "creator": "zengzhiyuan", "data_id": "a023c0ba-d4fb-42d1-a50a-90eb35e57fcf", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "not_sure", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Whether you’d like to continue to play Nosework for fun, to give your dog a mental outlet through the cold winter, or to eventually compete, every personality is welcome here as long as you’re kind to your dog.\nIf you’ve been through Intro to Nosework and your dog knows these three things, they are ready!\n- Ability to Search for 2+ minutes (with a couple search cookies is fine) without giving up on the search or checking in with you.\n- Know what they are searching for: Smelly Tree or other odor/visual combination.\n- Know to stay with their scent for 2-3 seconds.\nBonus: Multiple hides and/or the ability to continue searching (for food or to clear) after finding a single hide.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "dd586b2d-a98f-4e07-8c0c-e629e86971ec", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "96f0042c-415f-4908-8587-4811b45b10d3", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "aafd896e-7c7e-41e8-ba07-91b4d5f98a97", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "113966", "creator": "chupei", "data_id": "5d37bc84-e718-43db-b16d-03bc4dbde7d2", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001579", "creator": "jinzhenjiang", "data_id": "7d93a974-b2a4-43d0-8aa1-27b5c6ac89f4", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "why": "内容混乱"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "051560", "creator": "zengzhiyuan", "data_id": "8d376d25-2753-4e0d-b496-c598a6594746", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Again.\nJustine was totally right about crows. I wish I hadn’t been so hard on them so many years ago.\nCrows are extremely smart. They learn at least 250 different calls, and communicate in different dialects according to family, social group or in general. They are as smart as primates in many ways. They are omnivores and that makes their brains bigger and more complex. They mate for life. At one point during the PBS Nature documentary I was watching, I was reminded of Hitchcock’s “The Birds.”\nBut crows have hard lives. They rarely make it past adolescence: often getting picked off by hawks, or hit by cars.\nIt also seems crows feel emotional pain. There is a legend about crows having funerals, and it turns out this phenomenon has some scientific evidence. Crows generally are part of a social group. When one dies, the whole social group will often gather nearby and wait for a few minutes, before flying away.\nThis greatly moved me.\nTomorrow morning I intend on having a conversation with my local crows, because there are many of them still around my home. I will tell them that I’m sorry that they have gone through so much pain (especially because more than likely, there will be crows who have lost a baby around me) and let them know I understand, and I respect and value their journey.
