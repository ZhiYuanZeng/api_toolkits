And was i could it was some sort of upmarket event,\nI was told it was put on by the Salford council for Voluntary Services (CVS ) jointly with other Salford organisations, /police commanders and such and a all very formerly dressed?\nWell that is except for Me.? But just but managed to borrow a tie to look more presentable,\nThe room was packed and full to the gunnels\nBut we went to the very back of the room and sat at a table,\nAnd i waited a to see what this event was all about, and also to find out more about this certificate, as i was not told much about it strangely,\nThe event started with speeches from the dignitary’s of Salford, with them introducing different category’s of Salford groups of people how do unpaid voluntary work helping and supporting Salford people .And do amassing things all round Salford, and all totally unpaid, what great caring people i thought some of the things we were told about some individuals that volunteer year in and year for years, brought tears to ones eyes to be honest,\nFrom helping people with terminal /physical and mental to all kinds of disabilities that these charities and individually also I would like to add do to help Salford people, Just amassing I thought , And it included Carers how i feel are also unsung heroes. And give their time to help so many, I was well captivated watching it all,\nAnd gradually it droned on me I might have to possibly to go to the stage and pick up the charity’s certificate did voluntary work for, I thought, as I am not one for such things,??\nWell it went on with lots of different categories of people being called to the stage to pick up certificates for the great voluntary work had done.\nThe group come up about people doing voluntary work helping local Salford people how at times needed support and advice and help.\nAs for the last around 5 years I had been helping to organise and sort out the finances of a local Salford charity that got into great finances trouble.\nI was approached by a well known London charity some years ago. How they got to now of me and got my name To this day I do not know?\nThey but I found out they new quite a bit about me,\nAnd could tell they new i that I had worked as the manager for a Salford manufacturing firm (.which i did firm for some 35 years, I and worked myself up from the ground floor to become the overall manager, which I run completely ordering buying selling managing its finances and looking after my staff of at times around 100 staff with indoor and outdoor workers,\nI could tell that new I myself had had myself had suffered a mental break down. And I was totally open honest with them about this, and myself find nothing wrong about this as it’s also a fact that. 1 in 4 of people will also suffer some form of mental ill health.\nThis i now is, just how life is. With all its stresses and strains no one has to at times endure,\nI found at the time it can be somewhat embarrassing that people you do not now,, can find out all about a person and one’s own life But now it does not bother me to much,\nbut lot of people simply not realise that these days with the internet and such .it is quite easy to find out about other people’s lives.\nThis London charity asked if I would be interested in helping this local Salford charity that had got financial problems, and could close down if no help was forthcoming.\nAnd quite soon new they were looking to tap into my managerial skills to help save this Salford charity.\nStrangely I found I new one of the trustees of this charity I new a little and spoke to try myself to try myself to form a better picture of how this charity had started to go downhill\nGot into such great dept.\nI myself have often seen over the years some business down hill and start to slide into financial difficulty, and its\ndirectors kid themselves and keep running a company sliding in the same old way and simply hope things will get better without being honest and tackling the problems face on.\nThis i have seen many times. when directors simply do not want to face to facts and try to get to grips with the problems of a business charity and also in live we have all do this also at times, as it is simply human nature and less stressful to stick ones head in the sand thinking things will get better soon ,\nBut 1 out of 10 usually does not. Face this and start to tack the problem by seeking advice, And nether be embarrassed toSeek help as i now especially directors and the like do, but don’t As there are places are out there that give practical help and advice use them, i say,.\nI learned this charity had very big problems not just financially but also in general and its was all on its old trustees shoulders and they were liable for this dept also and Speaking to them personally i could see the stress was affecting their own health in my opinion and to be honest i felt for them as this is when on is doing ones best to work as trustees giving there precious time for in some cases i new for many years, and to be in and yet to now .such a situation well feel for them to be honest, as all were lovely and deeply caring individuals and still are i now,\nAs well as me, a solicitor and locally high standing manager was approached, 3 of us in all.\nWe three meet on are down to and discuss the charity’s problems, I mostly listened to what they had to say at first then put my contribution forward we all got on so well and had a good constructive meeting, One problem each of the 3 of us faced if any of us decided to become a trustee of this charity’\nWas we even as just new trustees would from a legal point of view, could also be legally responsible and liable for any dept the charity has, ?\nTo the point that even there was the possibility one could even have a charge put on one’s own home .even to recover any debts the charity had if it closed and went into liquidation\nOn us being advised the legality’s of especially now becoming a trustee, with the charity problems.\nOne decided to pull out, saying they did not want to go down this road due to other commitments and great amount of time they also would need to put in to helping this charity,? which we felt was a very faire statement, as even the solicitor and I had are reservations at that moment, just we two left\nThe solicitor was still interested, possibly joining and helping this charity.\nWe needed to see the last 5 years accounts but found little but managed to put to get to gather as much as we could to form a picture of it finances and such for its previous 5 years, and tolled the old trustees that I and the solicitor once we had gone through them /, We would get back to them in around a week with a decision .To see if we would could possibly help the charity or advice a different root for it,?,\nWell about 6 days later I got a call from this solicitor,\nHow explained to me ! That due to just today a very urgent commitments that had come up and that. He was sorry deeply sorry but had no alternative due to it but to, withdraw. I would like to add to . his great credit, and I now this person absolutely and genuinely wanted to help this charity out . That I could most certainly see this in him, But other urgent commitments came up for him and had to make decisions of importance’s ., such thing happen to us all at times, but such a nice person he was and is,\nWell that left just me? (Some how when I put the phone down the nursery rhyme. (TEN GREEN BOTTELS CAME INTO MY MIND FOR AN INSTENT,)\nBut this was real, life and the people this charity were helping at this time also, were depending on it for help crucial advice and practical and support and i could see they also could end up also in a extremely serious situation,\nAs if I decided not to help. I knew there was a great possibility it would have folded and shut down,\nAfter having a good look at the bits of accounts I managed to get my hands on. And going through it all and also after\nSpeaking to with the charity bank/ central charity/ and the local council and such\nI sat down with her indoors and the family and we had a good long chat,\nAs i new with being honest with my self new, considering i was also recovering myself from a mental health brake down,\nknew very well that at times I myself would need the support of my family (back ground)to help this charity get out of its predicaments,\nSo and waving all up carefully and logically as I could,.\nMy opinion was it could be saved and turned round in my and but due to its large debts and such. It would take hard decisions new forward planning and hard work and time, with all trustees to working as one\nMy estimation of time scale was 3 to 4 few years to sort it out turn it round and impose good and tight governance, and have it on a firm foundations,,\nBut most importantly I new it could still also provide good service for people of Salford wile on its way still, I new, so now,\nA full trustee meeting with all the old then trustees was CalledI could see all the old trustees were feeling some strain looking back now.\nI think expecting me to say thank you. But no thanks I listen what they had to say and my self then I had a chat with them all and tolled them that if they wanted me .I t would be a pleasure to become a trustee of the charity on certain conditions\nALL THE TRUSTES OF THIS CHARITY AGREED,\nAnd I became the trustee and treasurer of this charity and we started to make fast and hard and fast changes. the main thing was the charity stayed open and running and providing a servicing its clients,\nthis was imperative I felt, and made sure it was done .even opening an extra day with me manning the phone and office,\nto people in crisis, while also trying to sorting its finances and such out.,\nAll went well, and well it took me over 4 years to get it into a fit for purpose position and in a good building and on firm foundations, and better still importantly now with money in the bank and now well in black.\nWe took on a new manager and book keeper.\nImposed good governance. and also won new contract to set up new services for Salford people in recovery,\nIt was a challenge to me .Especially considering I was also at the time recovering from a mental health brake down\nBUT CAN SAY HONISTLY I ENJOYED IT SO MUCH AND IN A WAY IT HELPED ME MY SELF IN MY RECOVERY.SO IT WAS NOT A ONE SIDED THING ,\nAND WELL was well worth the effort and headaches and sleepless nights it gave me at times,\nAnd as it was on a good footing now and in a good finance position carry it into the future\nAs I decided now was the time for me to step down.\nAnd work on other projects I had wanted to do for some time,,\nBefore I did new trustees were interviewed and 3 new trustees took on.and then I stepped down, and started my procact with a friend to set up a Salford user forum, which we have just completed, but is in it early stages of giving a voce to Salford disabled people.\nWell someone it seems put my name forward to the CVS (Salford council for Voluntary services,)?\nSods ha\nSo 11/2 hours or so watching these lovely great Salford people being called out to the stage to pick up there the volunteer or charities Certificates they had won, for the all the great voluntary work they have done,\nIt was and inspiring listening to some of the thing such usually unsung heroes do for the people of Salford and for simply nothing, well I say nothing but I not that’s not quite right ,? As i now what I get out of it And money could not buy it, simply also it nice to pay back in a way what was done for me I when very ill and in hospitalised with my brake down and for a long time also, And to me to be able as to put some thing back, gives me a type of a good feeling inside and am sure a lot must feel this also,,\nWell I had a appointment and wanted to quietly off as I had a lot on this day, but was stopped by one of its organisers. And basically told how you must not miss the main words there great,\nand was lead by the arm back to my seat,??\nSo what came next was .all the different categories of volunteering .and there was quite a few, of their winners also to be picked out of them also the overall volunteer of the year for the city of Salford, .\nWell the Good of Salford’s dignitary’s in attendance there .like chef of police/ councillors /mayor and x moyrs and well to menny to mention here. Each spoke words of gratitude regarding all the work of the Salford volunteers,.\nAnd then came the announcement mentioning my name,\nI was just at the time eating a piece of food from the lovely dinner at the table, and nearly choked, when my name was read out,\nAnd wanted to run to the run toilet .but that’s a bit awkward when hundred of people had turned there heads to me sitting right at the last table at the very back’s had to stand with the rest at the stage then from the group the volunteer of the very was picked .and again was gob smacked when I was chosen,\nFor this award as over all volunteer of the year,?\nI grabbed the trophy seed thank you and crystal trophy. (Lovely also)got ASAP back my seat and sit into the chair as low as could .ha ha\nI was so embarrassed .and felt my face was burning and tolled after my face was as red as a beetroot,\nGod I thought ill get off now, and got up .But this lady came to my table and congratulated me on wining the Salford 2009 volunteer of the very for voluntary work in the Salford community, and chatted .and has since become a really good friend indeed,\nWell the evening by now was drawing to a close .and I was to late to meet the person I had made an appointment to but sorted that by phone,\nSo agreed with this lady I might as well wait and the last award event. I was tooled it was for the overall hart of Salford award. Picked out from all the winners of all the volunteering categories,\nAnd the compare went through a little abbot each god I thought I hope he douse not speak about with getting this award volunteering award,?\nBut only a little was said about me. (Thank god for that I thought) but i think my face still glowed reader still.\nAs then all the people were called down as they were spoken about .like I say I was last and went down and sort of hid at the back .and wanting to get back to my seat. as listening to what as I Said before all these people do .and in one case done for 12 years, come rain snow or sine .was well so amazing and amassing and hart rendering,\nthat’s the only way I can put it to be honest .as words .in such cases simply can’t show what such people i now do for the community, .but I knew well and they every single one of them, are extraordinary amazing people, in their own right, by the 20.000 thousand voluntary work that such people do Salford even as i right this last year alone 2011 in this sector is worth more than £121 million to the City of Salford each year.??\nNow it was time for the Hart of Salford to be named,\nBy this time was feeling I remember a somewhat shattered as it had been a long day for me. With also manning the phone earlier on,\nThere a great silence spread all round the room you could have dropped a pin, then a name was read out,?\nodd I thought how can i get out of this i intentionally stud at the back of the large group on the stage as was a bit shy then with hundreds looking on at the group on the stage,\nThen what I can describe as only like i have read the red sea parting, in front of my with the group parting each side to reveal me ,\ni did not really now what was going on for a minute to be honest, as when it hit me God I thought this is going to be difficult for me as also i thought they had read the wrong name out\nI was standing there in full view with hundreds of eyes on me?\n.How my god I thought .and walked as somehow my feet walked on like what seemed as on here own across to the presenters and dignitary’s of Salford stud at the fount .Murphy,\nI was handed spoken at leant about .which is I now why got away with it previously? And then handed a large most beautiful crystal trophy in the shape of a large star, the I remember the mike was put in front of me. And all I could say was\nThe first thing out of mouth was\n\"I am sorry but I think there has been some mistake\"\nAS I thought listening to hundreds of people i considered do much (more than I do. someone got the name of the hart of Salford wrong,)\nAnd I distinctly remember one of Salford longest servicing and most distinguished Salford Councillors a Cllr Joe Murphy.\nLooking at me directly and saying with a big Smile (no son there has definitely been no mistake)\nWhich ill nether ever forget his was the one of the most unexpected l strangest day of my life.\nI like many have been through a lot of good and bad times in my life through some bad illnesses I have had to fight\nTo good things like recently just becoming a Great Granddad,\nBut even now when I think about this day and think to the . 03/June/2009\nIt gives me Goose Bumps Still,\nPhilip Hamer\na salford lad\nALSO as a post script: May i say what I now and a now about the many thousands of people how give their time totally free.\nTo help and give support to Salford people .And in doing so also makes Salford in turn a better place to live.

It often results in monetary losses, legal issue, and irreparable brand image damage.\nWhen a business uses in-house testing, it will usually be lacking in the testing tools and efficient methods needed. There is an increased level of sophistication required for multi-device compliance. And businesses don’t usually have access to mobile testing best practices, guidelines, and industry standards.

How They Make Money: “From a consumer’s standpoint, it’s important to understand what the monetization model is for the company that makes these apps,” added Kowsik Guruswamy, chief technology officer at Menlo Security. “That alone can be very revealing in how the companies plan to use their data.” For example, an app might make money through sponsorships with the brands it partners with or it might offer customers paid upgrades. However, it’s also likely it makes money selling your data to advertisers or other third parties, which is why it’s important to note what kind of data it tracks and how it uses it.\nFor workers, create a listing with your available skills and your hourly rate.

Some of them individual specific.\nIn our daily life, we often overlook and we come across expenses which we dont anticipate or think of. I know Manish has written an article on this and mentioned about saving for unthink expense ( may be car repair due to accident/breakdown, Urgent Flight expense, Replacing TV/Fridge/AC etc etc )\nCan some of you comment on the expense type which we overlook which we need to taken into consideration during Retirement, Child Education, Child Marriage goals…\nExamples:\nYearly Insurance Cost\nReplacing Car, Home Appliance due to breakdown/Non working state\nTution Costs\nHome Repair cost ( Painting, Leakages, Worn out Interiors )\nGifting in Marriage/BabyShower 🙂\nThanks\nPattu Sir, I have posted the sample excel sheet to your mail id. As I also mentioned in the mail, it’s a simple sheet with no complex formula or macros but has helped shape up a realistic budget over few months.\nHope it helps.\nHI deepthy I am interested in studying your excel file. If don’t mind sharing it my mail add is\npattu [AT] iitm.ac.in\nThanks\nGreat. Thank you Pattu and Deepthy. Your insight and direction helps to bridge the gap between the ball park and the realistic figure…\nHi Pratibha,\nHad the same query few years back when I started saving for early retirement & what helped was when I started my own Bills & Payments excel sheet and started recording each and every credit & debits – expense and bills that I pay & the income that I get.\nI have everything here from salary credits to debits such as ATM withdrawals, credit & debit card payments, electricity/phone/internet/LPG/apartment, vehicle & equipment maintenance/AMC bills, regular life&vehicle insurance/NSC/RD/other tax saving option/premium/property tax payments and other recurring bills like software license renewals, satellite radio/DTH/online movie renewals etc. Think I have included almost all categories – you might have more, pl do a braindump to see what else you pay daily, quarterly etc. Most of your regular small expenses will be covered under ATM withdrawals & credit/debit card payments. Tip is that whenever you pay remember if you have the item on your chart – if not add it.\nOver 1year you will have a stable excel data of yoru incomes & expenses short & long term – I added a row for contingency too for those ‘just in cases’ that are not covered by insurance. Of course how much ever one plans, life can deliver surprises. One need not go on a negative mental trip of the darkest possibilities and just try to do our best – what else can we do, rt?!\nIf you are a couple, a combined Bills&Payments Chart would help.\nThis chart will not only give you an idea of your actual monthly/annual budget, it also helps you to decide on which items to take off the list over the time to reduce your expenses & save more, this also allows you to keep a track on when your next payments are due so that you never even miss a single bill payment. You can also use this to find over the time, how to pay more of your bills online etc.\nI look at the sheet every month & set up mobile alerts for the payments due from me for the month ahead & that way I keep my liabilities organized. This may be one step too much perfectionism but has helped me:-)\nI am unable to attach my Excel sheet here else would have shared with you. But here’s how the heading reads:\nPeriodicity (values like Monthly, 2Monthly, Semesterly, Yearly, 2Yearly, 6Yearly etc)\nPayment Options (Cash, cheque, credit card, online)\nService Short name (like TATA-AIA, AIRBB etc)\nService Description (like Tata AIA Nirvana policy annual premium, Airtel Broadband etc)\nDue Month/Date\nApprox Amount\nBill/Payment Notice will be sent by Date\nPeriod available to pay (like 10days – this will give you an indication of urgency)\nRemarks (add their contact number, mail id etc)\nAccount Details (note your Cust Id, Account number etc related to the service)\nPay Urgency (values liek CurrMonth, CurrQtr, NxtQtr, NxtQtr2&3, NxtYear, OnYear2 etc)\nPayment Website (add the website where you can pay BangaloreOne, Visabillpay)\nService Provider’s Home Site (add their homesite in case you need more info)\nDebit or Credit (mark it as debit or credit so that you can see your debit credit balance in a summary sheet)\nMake a summary sheet out of this and find out where your money goes…it will never cease to surprise you! Hope this helps.\nFor AMC and scheduled repairs and annual expenses I usually invest each month in a RD or liquid fund\nmy monthly budget has a 5 K allocation which takes of those baby showers or weddings\nor anything unforseen\nI have an emergency fund (6 months expenses) and I make sure I dont touch it for these kind of expenses.\nOne lesson I recently learned: You must always allocate a little something to the emergency fund each month even if it is adequate.\nLife can throw a googly at you and if you get an unanticipated new monthly expense to be handled for the rest of your life the money that streams into your emergency fund will help out at least a bit.\nIf you want god to laugh tell him your plans goes a saying! We can only continuously live and learn and make sure our mistakes are new!\n", "final_result_str": "no", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "1d312701-485f-41d1-8a9a-ee003d829905", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "多人聚合，分段不清晰", "repair": "no_repair"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "7d475332-8a35-42d0-a05c-f0de42952035", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "后续评论内容缺少分隔", "repair": "no_repair"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "5def4041-c498-4584-9c32-646cd87fc9df", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "- 文章和评论混杂在一起， 没有分行", "repair": "need_repair"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "7d534a9e-8a56-4327-bddc-5dff1b70fa5e", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "评论没有分割", "repair": "need_repair"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

I’m uncomfortable to mention that for at least the 1st 2 years hereafter article was actually posted, I gained $0 from ClickFunnels.\nThis was unbelievably annoying, as well as to this day I’m still puzzled by why I could not have actually made a few random ClickFunnels compensations.\nDue to this lack of success, I put ClickFunnels on the back-burner and focused on various other traits.\nFast forward to the middle of 2018. I was randomly listening closely the Funnel Hacker Broadcast podcast on my drive to work, and I took place to pay attention to episode 202 … which is Spencer Mecham’s episode.\nI possessed no idea who he was at the moment, but I found out that he was actually the # 1 ClickFunnels associate which truly aroused my passion.

One of my favorites is the Affiliate Business in a Box method which you can learn more about in my Udimi case study.\nYou can also check out my ClickFunnels affiliate guide for more ideas on how to make money with share funnels.\nWhat I don’t like about ClickFunnels?\nBad Part # 1: Why is adding a funnel so slow?\nAfter choosing your funnel type and template, it needs to get added to your account.\nFor some reason, this process seems to take around 8-10 seconds every time.\nWhile I don’t know what’s really going on behind the scenes, it doesn’t make sense to me why this would take so long. It’s a bit annoying, although just a minor inconvenience.\nBad Part # 2: Limits on funnels you can create and visitors\nClickFunnels limits you to 20 funnels, 100 pages, and 20,000 visitors on their cheapest plan. I’m really not a fan of software products that limit you in this way.\nIf you are just building sales funnels for yourself, these limits are probably ok.\nBut you may get more annoyed at these limitations if you are doing client work, building funnels for multiple customers, or promoting ClickFunnels as an affiliate using share funnels.\nWhat is the Funnel Hacks system?\nIf you’re looking to get the $297/mo. Etison Suite plan, then it’s definitely worth it to sign up with Funnel Hacks instead to save some additional money. For $997, you’ll get six months of the Etison\nA small drawback is the price. There are only two pricing options, at either $97 a month or $297 a month. In the grand scheme of things, this is not a huge drawback, just another investment in your business, and like I’ve said, you get a good package for it.\nLackluster Customer Service\nBeyond that, customer support is iffy at best. In my experience, they’ve been fine with basic questions, but if you ask them more difficult things, especially about more advanced features, they won’t be very helpful.\nCult-like user base and software too reliant on Founder\nThis is not an objective criticism of their product but I take a slight issue with their marketing that I think is worth mentioning in this ClickFunnels Review.\nIf you get sucked into one of their funnels, it’s hard to escape the hype surrounding it. They have a great marketing for sure. However, from a user experience perspective, it can get obtrusive. Once you sign up for the software, you can try to look at the objective features of the software and integrate it into your own workflow, or you’ll be lost and forced to learn Russell Brunson’s marketing methods.\nThis means you’ll find yourself buying online courses, books, attending seminars, and getting sucked iiticisms tend to refer to do-it-yourself approaches which can be cheaper upfront and yield more control over managing certain details. For less experienced users who are mainly seeking efficiency and an easy to use bundle of tools, I wouldn’t emphasize this too strongly.\nClickFunnels Pricing\n: My Personal Journey With Sales Funnels\nSince the top CF affiliate was saying to do it, that got me inspired to create my own bonus value stack.\nAnd I tied them together with some personalized coaching to create what I consider to be the best ClickFunnels bonus package that anyone is offering.\nEtison Suite plan, then it’s definitely worth it to sign up with Funnel Hacks instead to save some additional money. If you get sucked into one of their funnels, it’s hard to escape the hype surrounding it.\nConserve Money and Time Click Funnels enables you to conserve cash, time and effort when arranging marketing and sales funnels from the start.

The response was immense and provided the Council with insight not only on that subject.\nSome people questioned the Council’s place to ask such a question; others wondered why we would choose Facebook as a channel to engage with the profession. Some even wanted the Council to shut the conversation down. We want to respond to those comments and concerns and clarify some things.\nIn 2015 the Education Council came into being when the Teachers Council was disestablished under the Education Amendment Act. The Teachers Council had mainly regulatory and disciplinary functions, whereas the Education Council has a much broader statutory mandate with greatly increased professional functions, and, as a result, the scope has been substantially widened. Our mandate clearly states that our purpose includes leading public debate on education issues. We are the only professional organisation that represents the whole profession across the sector, which includes Māori-medium and ECE.\nThe broader mandate includes commissioning research, sharing best practice and developing programmes to strengthen leadership across the whole sector. To do that well we must have our ‘finger on the pulse’ and not only understand the issues and debates going on in the sector but lead the discussions with the profession so that there is an opportunity to share expertise and build the profession’s collective practice.\nThe decision made to ask such a question on Facebook, in hindsight, lacked judgement. And while the number of people who responded was greater than any other poll we have created – nearly 2k – it’s clear we got the method wrong. The question was never intended as a ‘survey’ to gain a deeper understanding, polls don’t have that ability; the way we consult with the profession is carried out with far more rigour than suggested by the poll. But without doubt, this is a subject that is clearly important to the profession, and we would be doing a disservice to end it here.\nSometimes getting a sense of the areas where more support or research would be useful can quickly be assessed by snap polls. The tools we are moving towards to better initiate research are coming to the Council with the move to an online platform that will create a safe, robust and professional environment, and even with those tools in place, we will, from time-to-time, continue to use polls when we think it is right.\nWe want to know what’s important to the teaching profession, even the controversial subjects because if we don’t ask the questions, we can’t provide the right resources to teachers and leaders.\nFacebook is an effective platform to engage in a somewhat non-formal way, and the question of privacy was raised. Concern for teachers’ privacy and data collection is considered by us, and in no way are we collecting the information gained via social media as a form of storing evidence to use against individuals. All future polls will include a disclaimer to make that obvious.\nShying away from controversial subjects will not be our space. Our recent Teaching Today podcast episode brought together a panel of experts to discuss the issue of physical restraint in an education setting, which resulted in lots of feedback from teachers and parents with differing views. Modern Learning Environments is also a critical subject that requires more input from the sector, and to keep that going our next podcast episode of Teaching Today will focus on this topic.\nBy all means, email us your comments and questions that you would like discussed on the podcast to letstalk@educationcouncil.org.nz and, if you think you would like to contribute in person, volunteer to take part on the podcast panel.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "6306318d-deb5-4372-8922-3a1a7d2db2ab", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 宣传文章，逻辑合理"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "0c23bb55-0f84-4397-861d-3523380f0438", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "逻辑清晰"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "7eae2b1e-bb05-4c99-8c44-c3bda131356e", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "公共教育社交媒体讨论"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "6d2e4e09-e736-4e27-a2ad-16d6c7ebff48", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "民意调查"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

The life we once shared is a distant memory, gone without warning, changing us all into these new beings, a challenge we grapple with each day.\nNineteen months post surgery, the life we knew interrupted, the future uncertain.

The coral, fish and piers are 3D, and the different textures allow the use of colour and various elements to take on different dimensions.\nThe piece will have blue toughened 6mm tinted glass fixed to the design (not shown in this photo to provide a better view of the artwork).\nThis demonstrates the ability to incorporate artwork into your life, whether you have a large backyard or a small balcony space. Smaller areas just require a bit more thought and when the piece can serve a functional purpose, it makes this investment a true enhancement to the liveability of this unit.\nFor more information about custom ironwork, please contact us at Jalmer by email or phone 08 9526 2035 or check out our website www.jalmer.com.au.\nFor gift ideas - go to our Art Shop.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "f3eb05e8-29c7-4e4d-9c8c-cc65453cb801", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "介绍艺术品，url打不开"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "5e85c736-d9a9-44e7-a835-74efe7155ab3", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "优美的广告"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "5febe190-c6cd-4ddb-a285-29c1e6ea4dea", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "- 营销内容", "repair": "need_repair"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "bf933876-0436-441b-8531-85c6cade3184", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "产品介绍页面"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Now the pause and play button usually activates Siri or Google assistant when paired to your phone but for DOSS they decided to have this button disconnect the bluetooth signal instead you don't get those voice assistance. Now the mode button allows you to cycle through these solid colors on the front facing speaker there's red, blue, green and this smooth aqua looking color to the right is the extra base button and it's also used to change the pattern of the LEDs, then you can have the lights stay a solid color but also pulsate to the beat stay on completely solid or basically you can turn them off and then there's this party mode which cycles through the colors I mentioned earlier and there's two more colors which are also included which is purple and yellow, rotating to the rear there's the passive base radiator and on the bottom left has the water resistant flap with micro USB ports to charge the speaker a 3.5 millimeter port for physical connections and a micro SD card slot now regarding battery life it can last up to 10 hours of playtime.\nThe bass of the Soundbox Pro is considered as a bassy speaker it has more bass than the JBL 4 yet at the same time much cleaner bass it's non distorting like Sony XB21 the bass hits slightly deeper than the JBL even the low mid range is slightly warmer in the vocals without muffling the audio quality for most songs, going into the mid-range most of the time the DOSS Soundbox Pro sounded alive and pushed forward and is very bright making vocals stand out and instruments pronounced.\n", "final_result_str": "no", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "3e989af4-0787-46a1-b1fa-75354926a4ee", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "优质广告"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "2a939c91-76e6-4cac-a117-e194e81e4e9f", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 产品介绍，可理解"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "7f7f0a38-f8c3-468f-9ab4-5aacfab6f161", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "数码产品评测"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "82d40954-1ed8-47aa-943f-c551a598fbc4", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "好像在说水枪？不知道主体在说啥", "repair": "need_repair"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

So I went running and was all set to approve defeat, yet when as I was gazing at the flooring I saw sparks of marble, NOT ceramic tile. I ordered their devices and also started meticulously lifting tiles to uncover the initial ceramic tile work.\nThen I refocused and also informed every person I essentially conserved the day, yet my heart still breaks since previous owners had covered the initial beautiful ceramic tiles.

Here's what some of them said.\nYou know what I did. I went home and bought one of those shirts, an extra large men's flag shirt, and I went home and I made a dress out of it. I made a dress. So I have this mini Aboriginal dress, and it looks pretty nice, and I wear this dress on Bondi Beach where anything goes and I can not tell you the energy of the people and the way people respond. Unbelievable. Bondi Beach, you know, anything goes there. I thought I was going to get beaten up! Twice I wore this dress. It was incredible. That was my own little experiment.\nI've been interested [in Indigenous issues] for probably about six years. [When] I went to school it was Captain Cook who discovered Australia. I read the Fatal Shore and then I remember [my daughter] did a school project and I rang up Aboriginal Affairs and they sent me out this information which I read and then became appalled and shocked. Horrified, mortified. And then I saw the exhibition and had the same response to the photographs, the people in chains. I must say I was aware of that but it really coalesced those images in the Fatal Shore - just to see those photographs. I really couldn't walk past, I read the information, but those photographs, those people in chains. And I remember trying to get the family to go through it to show them these things.\nI thought differently. I've met Aboriginal people ... the ones I have met ... didn't click with the way that, as a child, when you grew up and everything you heard [was negative] and then you see an exhibition like this, well then you see a lot more of the story...\nI think it gives you an added confidence.

Fuchsia is best planted straight into a boundary and being solid it will continue to blossom quite a long time after year. Most solid Fuchsia plants will develop into a fine shrub, a Fuchsia shrub is dealt with a lot of like some other shrub pruned approx mid to pre-summer, the more you leave the dead wood on top of the strong Fuchsia plant the better, pruning to right off the bat in the season might free the plant up to infections, in addition to in case there is a freezing snap the ice may very well enter the crown of the plant and kill the Fuchsia by and large, if the old wood is left on the plant it will assist with redirecting a portion of the ice away from the focal point of the crown.\nThe blossom size on these assortments is not huge however they will blossom for a long time of the year and are covered from head to foot with sprout, additionally these plants are so vivacious after just three years they will make an enormous Fuchsia fence in hotter pieces of the country.

Most Fuchsia plants will require a specific measure of squeezing. Squeezing Fuchsia’s will make the plant more rugged over the season however to much squeezing can bring about less blossoms, let me clarify the craft of squeezing, squeezing is the place where the plant makes them develop tip’s taken out to support seriously blooming side shoots, the issue we have is the tip you eliminate will have all the blossom buds, so eliminating them chops down the measure of blossom around then.\nThe side shoots will create after some time and make blooming tips of their own, this assortment has a solitary Magenta Red blossom which is extremely free blossoming so hard squeezing will not do too much harm.

Sorry for the delay – I think life just gets too busy sometimes! I am guessing that if you have crocheted (or have starting crocheting) your squares from Part 1 then there are loads of online tutorials that would show you so clearly how to join them – better than I ever could anyway!\nHowever, I am going to put my written instructions here for you because, if you are like me, it’s good to just read things sometimes, and you can also print them if you wish!\nYou may already know that I never intended to publish this design, it was in fact borne from just moving across the world with my family and I just needed a little comfort-crochet! I also had this beauty of a box from Scheepjes that I was yet to use – so the Mini Therapy Blanket started! I guess I ended up sharing this super simple design because A. you might be fairly new to crochet – and this is a great beginners pattern, B. you may have a Scheepjes box and are unsure what to do with it, or C. you also need a little calm crochet time…..\nSo, once you have decided on the layout of your squares you get begin to join them! Now, how I am doing this – I have re-arranged in my box the order that I would like my colors to go, then I crochet one or two squares, and join as i crochet the squares. BUT, you could could just as easily crochet all the colors and then lay them out and then join-as-you-go. The only thing with doing it this way is that it might be a bit fiddly to layout and then keep them in order – unless you have a spare bed to lay them on or similar.\n(just as a little note, I have kept the tail of leftover yarn from each square – once you break off the yarn just wrap it around the ball band as you can keep these for making yarn pegs or a little colour library)!\nMethod:\n1st Square; With MC join to any 1-ch space and continue with 3 tr, 1 ch in each 1 ch-sp, and working [3 tr, 2ch, 3 tr] into each 2-ch corner. Fasten off\nSecond and subsequent squares; using MC work as first square, when you reach the point where you will join, you just need to continue working as normal but instead of working 1ch between the 3 tr clusters you slip stitch into the corresponding 1ch-sp of the square you are joining to. For example… 3 tr, 1 sl st into 1 ch-sp of adjoining square, 3 tr….\nWhen you reach the corner it can be a little trickier but the same principal applies…when you are joining to 1 square you will slip stitch into the corner 2 ch-sp of the meeting corner, then 1 ch, 3 tr to complete the corner…when you are joining to 2 or 3 squares, you need to slip stitch twice into the corner(s) instead of 2 chains, then continue with 3 tr to complete the corner.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "48806d56-d155-4f4c-8f65-e5397e974bca", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "- 逻辑：不明白", "repair": "no_repair"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "c73be945-864c-4fa8-8342-1e6b02742471", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "逻辑清晰"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "ef92bb3e-1283-436c-8ad4-4a7efbf32391", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "不知所云", "repair": "no_repair"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "8a40627a-1dfd-4629-8271-35bb39e854be", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "编制教程"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Not sure how long it's been like that or how long it'll be until things are fixed. Because of this delay there'll be an extension to the posting times. The first round will be over when the last debaters are done and we get a chance to go over them.

The epic competition will continue on through August. Remember that you can co-write with up to two others on this and kick some lightie butt while connecting to the Dark Side. What more could you want? Soon as I get more time IRL I'll start rolling out some minor changes to the Krath site.

I had been planning out this party for my grandparent's and things were going rather well until that day. My grandpa has Parkinson's along with many other things and he had a bad shaking fit the morning of the party. An ambulance took him to the hospital shortly before we all came over to start setting things up. He came out of his fit and came home to some good food and family. Well the neighbors didn't see him come home but saw a lot of people coming over a few hours after the ambulance took him. People carrying food and sticking around for a while, heh, it's a good sign that someone has died so they all thought my grandpa had died. It was a great party though and it was good to see those two old people enjoying themselves.<p>Ok I just have this next weekend to get through and I'll be more active again. Planning a big party and a wedding in less than five weeks is taxing! The best way to get a hold of me is through email.

Yet here we are, I on my mountain top--one that is broad enough, however, that our cows are in no danger of being part of a landslide--and he, rebuilding a run down farm. Not his own, but he's planning buildings, studying fertilizers, going cautiously, challenging both brawn and wits, that these New England hills give back their best to us.\nIt seems like something I've always been waiting for, this country. From the moment I wound up the mountain to my home, the far awayness of everything, the sleepiness, made me wonder if this might not have been the original habitat of Old Rip, instead of the Catskills. If these New Englanders could go to Iowa, they might return and see their land with new eyes. Not that Iowa is not beautiful, with her broad black acres criss-crossed with baby corn as pie crust used to stripe my mother's cranberry pies; with young oats covering the earth like a velvet green carpet.\nYet the broad stern acres seem to challenge one. Here the land--not the people, for no people could be kindlier than Iowans--seem friendlier. Beauty is so riotous. It lures one away from work. It seems to say, \"Relax, we will take care of you--\"\nStill, how a living can be wrung from these rocks I have yet to learn. As I coast down the mountain these homes that crowd close to the pavement mystify me. I want to go inside, know the people. In Iowa I did not feel so about the homes I passed. There, I knew the spirit. Here I have yet to learn it.\nSkeptics may wonder if the realization of my dream equals the dream itself. I only repeat: Life is one thrill after another. My youngest son leaping down the garden path, arms and legs at all angles, as he goes each early morning, to feed his baby chicks; my husband and sons surveying in the pasture, or the sound of their voices coming to my opened window as they work in the garden below me; the whole family gathered around \"Dad\" by the stove as he tries to feed warm milk, with a spoon, to a chilled baby pig, each child jealously eager to do his bit, hold a spoon, a cup--! Farming is such a family affair, and as such, it is the source of my thrills.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "a85b2e2c-6ee1-456a-baf7-af686679b344", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 家庭生活记录，可理解。"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "9518e93d-c283-46ae-b279-61d8695f030c", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "文学作品"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "ad2a7269-cff1-417e-8788-47d1bd96d6ec", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "博客内容，有逻辑"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "45526275-47e6-4375-bb4d-c641d21bd6c4", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "小故事"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Here’s a different perspective on the matter.\nAs part of my second year in the technical theater class during seventh period, I help build sets and work on the less physically tasking aspects involved in a show, such as lights and sound.\nSome high school theater students across Orange County participate in a program called Cappies, which recruits youths from one Orange County campus to attend dramatic performances at another one and to write an evaluation of those shows, also known as critical reviews.\nSo as our tech crew read through Cappies reviews for last year’s musical, “Chicago,” we realized that the critics ignored most of the technical aspects in favor of appreciating the actors and dancers more.\nSince the reviews were read while discussions about the set for Sunny Hills’ theater production of the spring play, “Play On!” (May 15-18 in the PAC) were made, it was a perfect time for a bit of discussion.\nAnd so the ranting began.\n“They think it’s impressive for the show to be this great?” one of my theater tech classmate asks. “They should see all the hard work I put into making the show sound great.”\nAnother of my peers responds: “I don’t think they realize all the hours that we sacrificed after school to actually make the stage not look like an empty black spot.”\n“Those lights were a pain to hang up and adjust,” says another student from the technical theater class..\nAnd then my turn.\n“I wish there was a way to tell them that I sacrificed my sleep to make this set seem like an actual house,” I say. “Painting the cubes that the ensemble danced in took way too much time than I would’ve liked.\nYes, you read it right.\nFrom building the actual set to hanging up lights and to recording many sound cues, techs do almost everything that one can imagine.\nBuilding the set is always the first thing we do, and it involves using drills to screw pieces of wood together, cutting wood using a miter saw and painting.\nOne big obstacle in our path for “Play On!” was painting and glossing french doors that are average in size and pretty wide, which are very fragile and have lots of little nooks and crannies.\nAttaching them to the actual flat took a few days, such as making sure the doors were level with the ground and having to be careful so the wood didn’t split. Such a prop is a major component in making humorous scenes, such as an actor peeking through the slots and making sure the others don’t slack off.\nThen we spread out to our own respective jobs.\nAs opening night crawls closer and closer, we started to have tech Saturdays starting from May 5, which meant that we have to come to school and go to the PAC at 9 a.m. on Saturday and end close to 7 p.m. This last tech Saturday on May 12 went on until 9 p.m to make sure that both casts of the play went through the entire show without stopping.\nWe put finishing touches on the set and made changes to accomodate the actors, which usually just means moving set pieces back and forth many times to make them satisfied.\nIt’s pretty annoying because the original spot that the set piece was in is usually the final place that the directors decide on.\nTo allow more techs to have experience in different areas, I was next in line to learn all about sound.\nIt was a new experience for me, such as looking up the actual sound cues online and editing them in a software program called Audacity, which made me appreciate all the work my predecessor did even more.\nThen the week before the show came knocking on our door.\nAffectionately dubbed “hell week” by the techs, it is one of the most stressful times of the year with last-minute rehearsals and costume changes.\nStaying until 8 or 9 p.m. after school from May 7-11 really took a toll on me, especially when I had to finish homework and take a shower.\nYet I believe it pays off in the end to see a full house and the audience clap after the end of each song although techs don’t get to go on stage and take a bow until the last show because of a long-standing tradition.\nBut please. Remember how hard techs work their butts off backstage. Some words of praise and thanks are greatly appreciated. Even applauding when we come out and bow on the last night is great.\nSo don’t forget about us when you’re watching “Play On!” this week.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "9f841a8d-83da-4c39-822b-093a249a6444", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "：时间逻辑清晰"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "f4c43cc6-3a35-461a-8dd5-8764ed8b76c4", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 语句通顺"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "14e220c5-c625-492f-a3c4-192f0b5b9795", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "剧院和舞台技术主题"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "15f6ab94-bd4a-4067-b0f8-7d2035297fbe", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "演员排练布景相关"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Because in the house there is a lot of furniture. Therefore it is necessary to dismantle and pack, which makes transportation more convenient and safe. A way not too picky and straightforward, with just 5 minutes you can remove and install a bed by yourself. Just follow these steps, you can entirely complete them in the fastest way to move into a new home.\nRemoving and installing beds can be considered heavy work, making many people “most afraid” when moving. Besides having a large volume, the bed is very easy to be damaged if it is not removed carefully. It is the reason why many homeowners do not dare to let the employees of the transportation company support them. So they must remove it by themselves.\nWhy should you know the steps for removing and installing wooden beds?\nFor many homeowners, the bed is the most critical thing in their house. The style of decoration and color in the bedroom space must take the bed as the central element.\nFirstly, the bed must be of a size suitable for users and suitable for the area of the room. The height of a bed is also important to note: beds have a moderate height (especially for young children and the elderly). Selecting coaches with adequate height will help room space more spacious\nSecondly, beds should use good wood material with the best level for the user’s health, for example, natural wood. Avoid using metal beds because this material causes cold air and affects sleep quality.\nThirdly, the bed must have a high aesthetic and creating attraction. The style of the couch must be in harmony with the interior architecture in the bedroom.\nWith these factors, the bed is a high-value object in the house; thus it needs care and conserves cautiously. Understanding the steps to remove and install wooden beds, it will help homeowners avoid damage during use or when moving home. Moreover, with this knowledge, the homeowner can observe and monitor the transportation company employees that Did they properly remove and install the bed? Which avoids the broken bed condition. Not only that, the homeowner can remove and assemble the bed by themselves so that homeowners can be more assured about this issue.\nBefore proceeding to remove the bed, you need to identify the components of the bed. The structure of the bed usually has the main parts: bed frame, bed legs, support panels, and cut slats\nClassify beds:\nThere are many types of wooden beds. The two most common types of beds are beds has joints and screw-catching beds. Each kind of bed, there will also be different ways to remove and mount.\nBeds with joints:\nArticulated beds are removable and straightforward bed types, and the edges are joined together by bones that are chiseled tightly and without screws. For this type of bed, use the hammer to tap until it is loose gradually.\nBeds have screws:\nFor those types of the couch with screws, the dismantling stages need more complicated techniques and must have specialized tools to remove: drill, hex wrenches, screwdriver\nFirst, use the drill (you should use the best drill presses and best wood drill bit ), push the screws out, then use the hex wrenches to remove the screw, remove the screws in each connection between the bed edge and the bed body\nSteps when removing wooden beds\nStep 1: Carry out dismantling pillows, mattresses and bed sheets\nAfter removing the cushion, the pad, you need to cover it carefully to prevent it from getting dirty when moving. For beds, you use PE to wrap; this will help prevent scratches or tearing when transporting, which affect the value of the product. The pillow should not be placed in a covered bag because it is easy to generate moisture, cause bad smell and is a place of bacteria.\nStep 2: Remove support panels and cut slats of the bed.\nAfter removing support panels of the bed, continue to remove the cut slats of the bed. Then use tape to attach all the cut slats\nStep 3: Remove the bed frame.\nAfter removing the bed frame, use PE to cover it thoroughly, should cover two front (outside) of the bed and cover them (this helps to prevent scratches during transport)\nAssembling wooden frame bed\nThe reassembly of the wooden frame bed is very simple, and you need to reverse the steps of dismantling the bed.\nWhen removing the wooden frame bed to ensure the quality and value of the bed, you should use carton or foam boxes to surround the outside; it will avoid the bedsides from scratches and chips. Beds should also be limited to moving, removing and installing to ensure firmly and stability, safe to use. So you need to assemble the joints and screw carefully.\nIf the removal of wooden beds makes it difficult for you, there are now many transportation services, they remove, install and pack wooden frame beds. You can hire a service to ensure efficiency when moving. But you should choose reputable places to make sure your belongings are transferred to your new home is intact.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "a1509608-8bcd-46f7-bab7-420457b30825", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 介绍如何更快的搬家拆家具，语义通顺"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "da4d2f10-2b77-4e3b-86e6-ac54b813666c", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "搬家广告，错误较少"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "d9ee4d81-4ab4-4439-8ee2-f2feed127109", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "步骤清晰，有逻辑"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "5ed2c251-7715-4a70-b01c-e805638571e4", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "介绍怎么安装床"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

We have ben running close to normal production since Sunday!\n-\n9 points\n*CURRENT Tracking Rules*\nBigDutyDiesel and 8 others reacted to cyberdman for a post in a topicI've done some house cleaning and consolidation and added in a few new items to take notice of. Please review the items below for changes / updates. 1.) I request that you subscribe to this thread if you haven't already. Click the little button at the top that says \"Watch topic\". That way I'll get no frantic responses from any of you that don't keep up with this and ask me a million requests when I am gone or on vacation that I have already said I won't be available. You will be automatically notified as long as you have your forum / board settings set up properly. 2.) There are a number of you that have come to this forum for only the purpose of tracking and have in a sense spammed the forums with silly banter in order to fluff up your post count to get in here and demand some tracking action. I would think that if tracking was that important, many of those of you would have read my rules and responded accordingly. I know how you feel ... it is just like Terms of Service agreements or software piracy acknowledgments - you know, those agreements in software programs that scroll on forever that those people ask you to read, but you don't and you just click \"agree\" anyway to get to quickly click on the next prompt. Humor me and read each and every rule. I ask for a reason and there are so many rule breakers I'm close to my wits end with a lot of you. The rules are here to assist me in helping you - that is it. 3.) If you break a rule, I am no longer going to give you a kind reminder. I am simply just going to ignore your request. If you find you are being ignored, then you did something wrong. Figure it out. Re-read the rules you were supposed to have read in the first place. Then, once you are ready to comply properly, you can re-bump your thread properly. I am not going to respond until you do. 4.) I am sorry, but some of you are taking extreme advantage of my generosity and this free service I offer on my own time. Those that do are ruining it for everyone else. From now on: Absolutely no more than ONE (1) update per tracking thread, per week. I don't care if you are in the process of shipping, or have started production. You plan it out when you want to hear from me, but no more than once per week. I don't care if your lease is expiring and you need to know tracking info so you aren't left without a vehicle. Get a clue - If you are to the point where you need to know where your vehicle is in production because you may/will be left without a vehicle to drive - you have definitely already screwed up and have extremely poor planning that even I can't help you with. 5.) All PMs asking about tracking, information or updates will be deleted no questions asked. I thought this was clear, but apparently it is not. I don't care if you can't figure out how to post in this forum. No PM's about tracking or updates, period! 6.) I am not ignoring you, but at the same time I am not baby sitting your vehicle tracking either. If you want an update, bump your thread. If I haven't gotten to it in a few days, please re-bump - it may have fallen off my list of new updated topics. 7.) If you start to become annoying by wanting timely minute-by-minute updates of any minor thing that happened during your production run or shipment - please stop posting and see your dealer. I am not a service, I do this in what little free time I have because I want to. Please don't make me not want to do this anymore. If you respect my free time, I'll respect your request - it is pretty simple. You don't own me and I don't have to respond. 8.) I have to be at work to do this and I'll typically handle most requests in the morning. Don't ask me for a weekend update because you won't get it. 9.) If I have previously given you an update and in that update there was a specific date listed of something to happen next in the production run, please don't ask me for any more updates until that date has passed. I waste a ton of time with folks wanting updates to production dates I have given you when that date hasn't even happened yet - there won't be any changes. Please be smart about it. 10.) I am not the plant, delivery system, production scheduler or your dealership. Don't ask me to estimate any type of dates or time frame for you, or why things are such and such or taking so long. I can't and won't. There are a million and one variables in what happens with your order - things take as long as they take. 11.) I provide vehicle locator updates - status updates that can be found in your vehicle visibility report. That is it. Don't ask me to provide you with anything other than that, i.e.: no build sheets, no window stickers, no production schedules, no rail car information, no rail car numbers, etc. 12.) Do not make multiple threads for updates. Stick to one thread per VIN / Dealer Code-Order Number for updates. You want to follow a second car you have ordered, make a new thread for that vehicle. Repeat, do not make multiple threads for the same vehicle - even if you've provided incorrect information the first time. Just correct your mis-information in an update to your thread. I will get sick of figuring out which one I need to respond to and just not respond to any of your threads. 13.) I am a human, not an internet robot. I appreciate civility and I enjoy pleases and thank yous. However, please keep the extra chitchat outside of tracking info to a minimum because it helps me sort through threads I haven't upated yet and ones I have. 14.) I do not want anything in return for this. However, after all this work for you, my only payoffs are, 1 - knowing you are happy, and 2 - seeing that final picture of the vehicle I helped you follow for weeks on end. Please don't forget the photo. I love that. 15.) I need a valid VIN, or dealer code and order number to track your order. Please quadruple check the numbers you provide me. I know they are a long string of numbers and letters, but reporting those numbers right the first time will makes us both happier. 16.) When you bump your threads looking for more info, please repost your VIN (or Dealer Codes and Order Number) within your bump. 17.) Do not come here looking for information if you don't have either a VIN or proper, correct Dealer Code AND Order Number. Don't try to give me a Dealer Code with your vehicle description and expect me to find your vehicle. In most cases it is a needle in a haystack. Without both - forget it. If you have your DORA, the Dealer Code and Order Number are both on there, do me a favor and give me both or forget it. Also know this, most dealerships order multiple vehicles -even different types, under the same Order Number, so I will need a description of your vehicle along with your Dealer Code AND Order Number - such as: type, engine, trans, body style, that is it. Don't give me packages or trim levels, those things don't mean squat to me and are not listed in the Visibility Report as trim levels, just a laundry list of options. 18.) I am only a minor admin on this sub-forum, I have no control over how it works and how you get here. I can organize threads and close topics, but I am mostly just a user like the rest of you. Forget all the conspiracy theories of what I am doing to you in why you can't post here or your threads disappearing or whatever related to how the forum works, it is just all B.S.. 19.) If I give you a status and it is Unscheduled-Clean, that means you have a successful order in the system and it isn't currently scheduled for production. When you are in Unscheduled-Clean status I will provide updates no sooner than every two weeks, providing you bump your thread properly. There are a multitude of reasons why something doesn't progress quickly from that status to the line. It has to do with production schedules, plant availability, ordering priority numbers, where you live and that region / dealerships specific allowed allocation segments for that vehicle. I have seen Unscheduled-Clean status stay that way for weeks and weeks on end - even as long as 6 months depending on the availability of what you are ordering and speed of the plant, etc. etc. If you are upset about your vehicle being Unscheduled-Clean for an extended period, you need to work with your salesperson to try to adjust your order priority or find out what period your allocation unit is limited to. 20.) Enjoy yourself. If these updates start making you angry or hostile, or your attitude is making me angry or hostile, please go elsewhere and blow off some steam. Thanks as always. Any comments will be deleted.\n-\n8 points\nEV Transition-Can Dealers handle it?\nChrisgb and 7 others reacted to ice-capades for a post in a topicFord has been setting rules for the newer vehicles (Mustang Mach-E, Bronco, etc.) regarding advertising, sales prices, retail order compliance, etc. and enforcing them via an audit program for compliance. Dealers have to report scheduled retail orders that are cancelled by the customer or be in violation of the program rules.

Minor quality issues dealership is fixing today and I’ll pick it up tonight. This truck was a big deal for me since my previous F350 was stolen while I was away from home working, right before Christmas, and I’ve been without my heavy work truck over a year now. The wait for it was difficult because I had to turn away work opportunities. I wanted the options I selected and would not compromise since it’s replacement for what I had. The big hold up was adaptive steering, 5th wheel prep and any number of other issues, but it’s over now and I can focus on setting this beauty up to get new work done.

Since then we have moved some bins to the front yard between front verandah and front tree, The back garden is nearly full and running out of sunlight. I suffer badly from plant addiction and may need help.\nWhat to do now, I have ordered more Eugenia plants, maybe a spot out the front. There is still the roof, nah too many possums visit there. Does anyone else have this problem with plant addiction in these hard times. Last time I counted I had about 130 separate fruit varieties and then there are all the edibles, cacti and greens, and double up of varieties. I won't go hungry, that's one thing for sure. Any help out there.\nViews: 241\nIf your on a old sandbank/dune what you need is clay we have plenty of it at Murarrie and that is what makes soil having the right components as the compost disappears over time.\nYes the compost does 'disappear' -- and I now have a very black rich sandy loam from all that carbon breakdown, worm and microbial activity.\nNot the quickest way to make a garden.\nThat holds the moisture. Below that layer the sand persists thus there's not much to interest tree roots unless they adapt to the sub subterranean limits.\nIn the meantime all that carting of grass cuttings year in and year out is my substitute for a gym membership.\nI've now switched to Vetiver grass mulch which lasts up to a year on the surface.\nDave, I've heard that Bentonite is good if you have any concern about good minerals etc leaching away with rain. Things stick to it when wet.\nYou can sometimes buy the unscented stuff as cheap cat litter. I have not tried it, if I find some I'll try it in big bin and see how it helps. Most times the good stuff is in the top couple of centimetres anyway, that's why we should keep it covered with mulch.\nHi Barbara, great to hear from you. I like the fellow from Melbourne area (Angelo Eliaides) and have watched his videos on companion planting and close planting and low pruning and he is very informative.\nI would say my fruit trees are mostly sub-tropical with quite a few tropical plants as well. We notice that being under shade makes them reach to the sky for sunlight. It is a matter of working out which plants like overhead shade as in a rainforest and which ones don't. We have relocated our stalky trees to more sunlight for part of the day. It seems to work for us now. We have an amla tree that is over 3 m tall and needs a good haircut. Most of our trees are smaller growing varieties and I have tried to pick the early then later fruiting types as well.\nWhat we will end up with is - where most people would get 30 to 40 fruit on their sunlit trees, we would get about 10 fruit on shaded trees.\nDave you also make a good point with regard to the way Ernst Gotsch has his food forest. He plants in stages where he grows protection trees and leguminous, nitrogen fixing and pioneer trees mainly to cover bare ground. Then he chops and drops where necessary when a tree has done it's job of protection. I would love to visit his farm and learn from him.\nAlso a good teacher is the man who practices gardening the Eden way - heaps of mulch. a good foot and a half deep and cutting down his trees to shoulder height and then grafting different scions on the the strong branches for different varieties of fruit. He had a lot more space to work with.\nThe gardeners I am drawn to are people like Adam Shafan and growers of the tropical areas around Florida and also some in California region and also Amazonian forest. I am steering towards the berry type fruit of Jaboticaba, myrciara, eugenia, blueberry and mulberry and those types. Dark purple, and red fruits rich in anticoxidant etc. good for the body. Pawpaw and banana are also good food plants. I found that the citrus are quite needy and require watching for bugs etc.\nMany growers believe in multi-planting of fruit trees in the same hole, but I don't think this is natural but they do this where space is restricted.\nWe are in our 70's now and getting to old to keep moving trees around. So selling off the big ones and sticking to smaller ones that like the protection of shade and will grow/thrive in smaller pots for longer.\nHope I am not boring you with this stuff, but it is interesting hearing other peoples views.\nThanks everyone for all the good info. Christa, you have given me a few leads to look up on the net - thought I'd exhausted the potential there, but am obviously wrong.\nI have given up having fruit trees in pots - too hard to manage the repotting - so in the ground is going to be the way to go. Mulberry and fig fruit no matter what I do to them. We cut back the loquat hard the other day. It's probably still a bit too big, though. The Eureka lemon (quite young and still under 2 metres) got a haircut yesterday, after hearing that Andy keeps his citrus small and still gets fruit. There is no way I'll be cutting back the 20-year-old Emperor mandarin, though!! It's loaded with fruit, and will keep its favoured position in a bed all by itself - just some herbs underneath. The pomegranate has been nibbled almost to oblivion by the possums, so I'm not sure I should prune it at the moment - mind you, it probably wouldn't make much difference - there's no foliage on the upper branches anyway.\nFrom what I can gather, keeping fruit trees small needs to start when they are very young.Dave, you say that mangoes fruit on new wood, so cutting back hard after fruiting would seem to be the way to go. I've got orders in to Daleys for a Washington Navel, a Feijoa, and a Persimmon. It will be interesting to work on those (if they ever become available). Just on that, Daleys plants are getting very expensive when you factor in freight, don't you think?\nThey are expensive Barbara, we have visited the site as a group and if they did not have it in their nursery, you have to order and pay postage. There is a couple of northside places you can buy plants - Van Veen nursery, a place in Ladybird St Kallangur, and another place at Narangba, I just can't think of the name of the place. At least you can drive there and chose your plants. I buy from a fellow that Doug recommended from Cairns, little did I know, I had been buying from him on auction site without realising he was the same fellow.\nWe have the same trouble with big pots and bins, you might consider tree bags (made of a canvas type cloth) as least you can just cut the side down if you want to plant later.\nIf you were to buy a washington navel, buy a normal size and control growth while young. Sometimes they are still grafted onto rootstock that is hardy or more suitable for wet ground etc. The flying dragon rootstock dwarfs the top graft and I feel you can control the growth as a different option.\nWe have 2 old persimmon trees that are naturally small (Ichi-Ki-Kei-Jiro is the name). Good luck.\nThat's really interesting and very helpful, Christa. I'll have a look at those two nurseries. I don't think I'll need the man in Cairns yet, but you never know what happens if the addiction takes hold.\nChrista, thank you for pointing me at Ladybird Nursery. Went up there on Tuesday, and picked up a Washington Navel and a sugar apple, which he assures me I can keep small. Grafted Feijoas coming in a few weeks. Lovely place, great prices and quite a quick journey up the highway.\nGood that you could find something suitable to your needs, Barbara. It's hard to imagine what they have there behind a normal looking house.\nHey Christa - just keep planting - no such thing as being too addicted to plants :).\nBarbara, I have a black sapote that I keep at 1.5-2m high and I get fruit regularly. Don’t have jackfruit though but from what I’ve seen, it’s a far more upright growth than the sapote so I would imagine it would take up less space than the sapote\nThat's really encouraging, Susan. You certainly seem to fit a good few into your garden. It would be good to grow some of these trees. Don't need to get lots and lots of fruit - just a few each year on a tree I can net.\n", "final_result_str": "no", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "1596f43d-12dc-4b9b-9904-724cb38f575b", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "聚合内容：论坛帖子\n缺失分隔内容", "repair": "no_repair"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "ed43cae4-df57-4c88-8cb6-d416d94a3a7b", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "- 评论聚合", "repair": "no_repair"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "64b7822c-2931-42b0-add4-182caa086c7b", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "Any help out there.

You can arrive and settle here, find a sleeping spot and something to eat, and connect with other individuals to help prevent the destruction of the forest.\nDirections & Contact\nThe camp is located in Manheim, about 40 minutes’ walk from S-Bahnhof Buir (suburban train station). In Manheim you can follow the signs. The camp is located behind the sports ground. For info phone +49 1778707912.\nDiverse and family-friendly: come to our camp!\nThe camp is a colourful place for forming and expressing opinions. The participants are demonstrating against the open-cast coal mine and the destruction of Hambach Forest.\nThere are workshops here “for body and mind” from the morning to late in the evening. Lectures on climate change and politics, the personal energy transition and debates on lignite mining in the Rhineland (and elsewhere) are also held, along with workshops for discussions with activists and experts. There is a place on the programme for tai chi and yoga, and there is a painting tent in the middle of the orchard meadow where a local artist also offers an exciting programme for children. A white grand piano beside the kitchen tent invites participants to treat us to some music: it was brought to us by a pianist from Cologne who also enjoys giving short piano lessons.\nThe camp is registered with the police as an ongoing public gathering over many days. It has a kitchen with running water. There are solar showers, compost toilets and solar energy.\nSkillshare Camp\nThe autumn skillshare will take place from September 22nd till October 3rd at the camp. As you may have realised, our current situation is pretty chaotic. Among other problems, the police often refuse to let anyone enter the forest or the meadow. Everybody is welcome, whether or not you have a tent (although it is more practical if you do). We organize everything we do with donations. So it does not matter if you have no money – on the contrary: we provide water and food. Of course we also welcome families with children. If you have any questions or want to offer a workshop yourself, contact us at skillsharing.hambacherforst@nullriseup.net.\nWe say no to racism, sexism, transhostility (or cissexism) and any other forms of discrimination and inappropriate behaviour!\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "7434b5f5-3564-44bd-bbc2-0512688a718d", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 绿色生活环保宣传文章，通顺"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "0d46eb30-63ff-4f80-aacb-3c034dd03c05", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "聚合性内容，主题相关"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "113c633b-9e89-4cac-96b5-e84af5015b76", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "内容连贯"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "3fd638b7-fa33-4f43-aab6-9e83f90730db", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "露营活动宣传"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

It felt practically necessary – the only way context could be sufficiently established, that you could follow along with new developments. In the days before RSS – that is, only 5 years ago – you’d click through your list of links daily, just to discover if they’d posted something new.\nIt was all the better for the site to be one of the hand-crafted ones, where you knew that someone had to spend time creating the latest “entry” page by hand, updating the archives page. Those based on a dynamic updating platform had a curiously flat appearance to them, all “posts” the same in some respect or another… and yet there was an undeniable appeal, the simplicity of not having to upload, the ease of automatic archiving – and the brilliance of RSS, all for (practically) free.\nAll you had to do was learn the template.\nAnd then people (ok, at least I) got lazy. There were better designers out there, and they were giving away templates as they played with new layouts – CSS had arrived, and there was experimentation to be had. And then it got accessible – anyone could do it, technical skills or no.\nFor a time, it was good. People were experimenting, the format was evolving, and there was a whole net out there to be explored.\nAfter that time, it got staid. Everyone had a blog, a flickr account, a myspace page, and a facebook profile. And along came tumblr, tempting with its short-form updates. Youtube provided a diversion into video blogging, and the multifarious podcasting tools for those who preferred audio. And then came the prodigal son, twitter, life in bite-size chunks of 140 characters.\nNow, they’re all hungry, as the newly social internet runs on the back of that ubiquitous term, user-generated content. They ask you to Add a New Post, or What Are You Doing? or the latest prompt, What is On Your Mind?, as though the answers were being sought for anything other than page-views and the corresponding ad dollars.\nWhatever happened to us?\nSo it is thus that I’m prompted for a redesign, one I’m flagging ahead of time in order for it to sink in to myself. A re-organisation away from the blog format, one where we return to the idea of a “home page”.\nI no longer blog in the longer form about day-to-day things – I never had much to say, not being a diarist, and with the advent of twitter it entirely does away with the reason to post here for shorter items. The main thing I post here are the longer opinion/rant pieces, selected links I deem more interesting and noteworthy than simply appearing on del.icio.us, and finally reviews of movies, music, books etc.\nNone of these really make sense in a blog form – there’s no narrative continuity, no requirement for a timeline. The default archiving method has in effect fallen to being last-come first-served – and there’s no reason for it.\nMy most popular posts are the one where I detail the rules of the card game Sweep, and where I share a basic Indian recipe – neither of which is immediately obvious from the page you’re greeted with when you land on this site. It’s not that I want to particularly drive visitors towards these posts, but these are the ones that have become most useful to people, and there’s no reason Google should be the only “portal” in to my site.\nThus it falls to a redesign – as I mentioned, a re-ordering of how things work. Rather than allowing time to dictate the ordering and visibility of items, I’m going for a home page that returns more to the original use of the term. I’ll still utilise the tools available to me in the background, so RSS feeds, comments and the like should remain, but at first glance, things should feel a little more… hand-crafted.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "ae0894f0-aa3b-42ad-9da7-1b96f4fc54aa", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "：个人随笔记录"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "697e5dab-7dc1-4dfc-93b1-e3042cdf52ad", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 博客文章，语义通顺"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "b99eaf60-094d-41a0-b9ca-301f2ddd3b1c", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "主题为关于互联网发表内容的博客"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "a72b4769-7a75-492d-8842-6d891de383cd", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "怎么写帖子介绍"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

It sounds happy as well as makes you happy, but have you ever considered how humans have become so fond of music throughout history and in every culture around the world? No, because we don’t really need to. All we want to do is to enjoy and groove to it. Well, quite relatable fact though, but sometimes we need to exchange thoughts on something good for the sake of knowledge enrichment. Knowledge of anything only helps.\nSo, music does create a big impact over life, health and happiness. Practically thinking, it helps you forget a hard day at work, relationship disputes, financial loss, and ill-health to name a few. But, there are a few more interesting benefits of music what we have never tried to know about before. Here they are:\nMusic helps in verbal and visual learning\nStudies show that interactive music training helps children of ages 5 to 12 to understand things faster and better than those who are not taking part in the experiment. They tend to understand the meaning of any new word much clearly and explain it in a smarter way than others. The students also got to work on their IQ level and it developed at a quicker than usual pace. Music seemingly helped children boost their brain-power and improve their verbal and visual skills.\nThis happens because they have to go through a variety of intellectual lyrics, understand the function of rhythm, diverse usage of pitch and voice. It’s been shown that continuous musical training makes a child sharp and rational.\nMusic heals an ageing brain\nAs a person grows older and finally reaches his golden years of life, means becomes a sexagenarian or septuagenarian, the rate of his brain’s reflexes then starts dropping. He feels unable to focus on everything he wants and work on that. Here, music helps them retain their brain reflexes and feel like young once again. When a person puts himself to music, he then has to concentrate on so many things simultaneously. Right from lyrics to instrumental incorporation and even the context of the whole song. You must be aware of the fact that each song tells you a story and the listener feels obliged to understand it to feel the real essence of the song. In an attempt to what this song has to tell about, an ageing brain too starts retaining its reflexes.\nThe door to happiness passes is through music\nNeedless to say, music heals your dead nerves and gets them functioning once again. The instrumental beats and the lyrical substance take the listener to another level and help him think of only happy things. May be, this is why, today, everywhere the “installation of music” has become sort of essential. For example, DJs for corporate events and parties, wedding DJs, DJs for birthday parties and so on. Music helps a party get energized and be memorable. Regardless you are happy or sad, music only helps you cheer up for a little longer. You love its instrumental collaboration and do not want to pull out anymore.\nMusic has a good effect on your heart, blood pressure and pulse rate\nWe listen to music with our muscles. – Friedrich Nietzsche\nTrue 101%. We feel it and then we can feel the positive change in us. Music does impact our emotions, psychological as well as brain effects. It also saves you from becoming the prey of depression!\nHave you ever noticed that every person has different taste in music? Did you ever try to understand why this happens? Why do not you like the song your best friend goes mad over? You do not like all the songs available in market, you choose a few and then tend to gravitate towards a few niche genres. This happens because not all types of music can feed your brain with endorphins, which is known to add to vascular health, but a few can. Also, some studies, which have been conducted lately said that patients, who had survived cardiac attacks, did not seem anxious or feel the pain after listening to a moderate number of tracks after the attack. It appaers that music also impacts your blood pressure and pulse rate.\nSleep without music does not sound good\nGenerally, when you go to bed and light goes out, all you get to see is how hard the day was and subsequently become anxious about tomorrow as well. This kills your sleep bugs. Here music helps you keep any sort of anxiety away. Just put the ear buds into your ears and play the most favorite song you have always loved listening to and see how fast you fall asleep.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "38966fcb-cdda-48ec-9e38-8725f186cbe0", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "主题鲜明"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "48fd45ac-0391-46c5-98ec-178af41f4402", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 描述音乐的内容，语义通顺"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "f998cf00-29b5-4919-8834-675fe7876ce2", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "音乐相关内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "2e902990-c495-4ff3-a1c1-ab5bdd1e6d06", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "音乐相关"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

See if this is familiar:\n- You have a bright child, who is interested in many things, but not reading. Your child loves listening to you reading books though!\n- Your child has made some progress, but repeatedly guesses short, common words, sometimes after reading them on the very last page. You see your child read some long words fluently though, like magic.\n- Your child’s progress seems to be slowing rather than accelerating. You are worried about a collapse of confidence. You may even feel that you are losing the bright, happy child you knew for the first 6 years.\n- Your child’s spelling in free writing is totally atrocious, despite weeks and weeks of spelling lists! It’s like pushing water up a hill.\n- You have been told to “…just do more reading practice“. But that is getting harder and harder, not easier. It might sometimes even turn into a battle.\n- You love reading yourself and you may easily have another child who has been learning to read fine. So you really feel it is not about how you have been helping or how much reading your child has done. Something else is going on which remains unexplained.\nYes… you really are in a tough, worrying and puzzling situation. I was there too as a parent, by the way, many years ago. But I have good news for you.\nWe set out in 2008 to crush this problem, finally. We have succeeded.\nMy team has now worked with thousands and thousands of children showing exactly those patterns and in recent years every child has progressed well on the new systems we use. Then their spelling generally starts to take shape too, as a sort-of free bonus!\nAfter years of R&D here in Oxford we can now guarantee (see below) that you can drop the worry and stress over the next few weeks. I can promise you that it will be fine, if you follow our simple instructions.\nLearn why you are seeing these patterns\nI think you are going to like this. An answer at last!\nThe reason your bright child is showing these frustrating patterns is because of the natural inclination your child has to memorise whole words visually, instead of leaning towards trying to decode them (from letters to sounds). That has allowed some progress, but has made all those short, interchangeable words very hard to get right. They all look the same! And the context often does not give it away. With long words the context often makes them obvious and so the guess works.\nOften this pattern is triggered by a very strong visual memory (a situation we call optilexia). It can also come from a bit of glue ear when the child is very small, which delays the development of their auditory processing a bit.\nMany of the children we help are actually some of the brightest in their class! It is a tragedy for them to be feeling inadequate. It is their super-bright visual learning style that has led them down the wrong path. They were not to know it was a dead end.\nAll we have to do is change that whole word technique and things will drop into place fairly quickly. Conventional phonics often does not achieve that, but our new trainertext visual phonics approach (TVP) does, every time.\nIn just 15 minutes per day of fun, easy online reading practice with our trainertext, you will see a new child, even from Day 1. We normally see a clear breakthrough in 60-90 days and full reading confidence developing soon after.\nNew century, new technology\nWhen an approach has not worked after months or years, it’s time to try something new:\n- The old, 20th century methods have always failed lots of bright children.\n- Our system uses the child’s neural strengths to make it easy.\n- We have been testing and refining this system since 2008.\nComplete support for you\nWhile our lessons are online, our support is very human:\n- We will support and guide you all the way in our messaging system and over the phone.\n- You can talk to us at any time. Give us a call today for a chat!\n- Our mission is 100% success and we will do whatever is necessary to achieve that success for your child.\nFree Assessment, Free Analysis & 10 Lesson Free Trial\nWe want to make this easy for you to test:\n- Free assessment of your child’s reading and spelling patterns.\n- Free analysis of what the cause of difficulty has been.\n- Free use of the system (with support & prizes) for ten lessons.\nMotivation and fun for your child\nIf you have ever tried to drag a horse to water, you will know it is hard! And they don’t have to drink when they get there.

He tried the TV but nothing good was on. He made his bed and was sure not to eat too much of their food or leave a mess. He walked on egg shells to ensure that he was a decent house guest. His uncle was gone to work all week and his aunt had many social events with the local ladies that she went out to. Most of the time he was there, it was just him an 50 acres. The animals were a little scary so he stayed away from them. The geese would nip at you, the dog would nip at you, the cows could crush you and the chickens would peck you, Nolan didn’t like any of the animals.\nHe would also dream strange dreams at night. They were different here from most places. The colors and the lighting looked different, the stories were all scrambled nonsense. It was just about the most boring place he had ever been. He loved that! No one was anywhere. When the animals would leave him alone he could finally have some time to be truly alone. Being alone was his favorite thing. He didn’t watch anything or read anything all week. He was so happy that everyone was gone all day. It was just him and 50 acres, listening to the wind and letting the sun shine on him. It made him feel free and alive!\nAt night his aunt would make home cooked meals. A little piece of fresh farm chicken, a couple of home canned vegetables, and a couple of from scratch rolls were on each plate every night. It was so simple, healthy and delicious. Then they would watch the news together and his aunt and uncle would ask Nolan questions about it. They were so impressed with his ability to talk about current events and to understand them. It was the only thing about him that impressed them so he tried not to mess it up by saying anything too crazy.\nNolan had to downplay what he knew for most people, even smart people. They couldn’t handle seeing life through his eyes, it could break them. He always noticed when he said something that was over the heads of an intelligent adult, they had so many questions but couldn’t ask them. They couldn’t organize the thoughts to get to the thing they didn’t know. Most would just shut down right there before their brain broke. Sometimes they would get mad or attempt to intimidate Nolan down from his position. But he wasn’t wrong, they just didn’t know all that stuff.\nHis conversations his dad and Mr. DJ taught him a lot of things that other people didn’t know. Maybe this was the thing his dad taught him. He couldn’t tie a knot and he had to learn to through a ball from another kid, just like most of the things he had learned in life; but Nolan knew business, news, politics, and current events. He understood things that most people never would. Nolan didn’t give much thought to this being a skill or a talent but he could weave a 360 degree understanding of current events into his head until it became predictive. It all seemed simple to him, to know the direction things were moving and what was coming next. He wasn’t that smart so he assumed that everyone could do that. The most fun he had that week other than being alone, was talking about the news.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "aa11f918-65de-48e7-84f2-220b8784bf48", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "网页：小说片段"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "32ea8699-2094-44cf-afeb-2640ed16b0fd", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 生活记录，有逻辑性"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "23701521-207f-4405-90fa-204aa79b321a", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "有逻辑文本"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "18e7c4d3-46c8-4541-902e-590ca8ed7bf9", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "日记"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Chapter 1\n\n## THE FIRST DAY\n\nThe earth is formed and no longer empty, yet darkness rules over the surface of the deep, and the spirit of God hovers over the waters, polluted with hydrocarbons and chemical residues flowing from city drains, oil wells, and ships' ballast. These waters are devoid of fish and sea life, harvested to extinction by giant factory ships. Toxic blue-green algal blooms choke the remaining life from the sea.\n\nPlastic shopping bags, discarded bottles, fishing line, and polystyrene cluster together to form rafts in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. The largest of these floating rubbish dumps, the North Pacific Gyre, covers an area twice the size of France. Sea levels rise. Current and wind anomalies cause supertides — periodic rises of over a metre in some areas — salting arable land, destroying homes and livelihoods. Storm cells roam the earth like pillaging tribes.\n\nConflict flares across North Africa and the Middle East. New, free states descend into sectarian violence and disarray. In Europe and America, public anger over inequality, carbon blowouts, austerity budgets, and food prices turns to fury. A new age of protest gathers momentum.\n\nIn Aden, Yemen, Isabella Thompson, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, sends her daughters, Hannah, 11, and Frances, 14, to the airport cafeteria with a five-hundred rial note to buy chocolates.\n\nThere was evening, and there was morning. The first day.\n\nRabi al-Salah Conference Centre,  \nResidential Complex, Dubai\n\nDay 1, 10:35\n\nDr Ali Khalid Abukar casts multiple shadows, dark and light, on pastel shades of walls and carpet. A white demitasse coffee cup sits on the table beside an open copy of the Khaleej Times. The blinds are drawn tight against the morning sun.\n\nSweat moistens his skin, and the lenses of his glasses fog as he moves across the room to the mirrors that make up the wardrobe doors. He removes his glasses, cleaning them with a handkerchief, and examines his image. Bloodless lips. Armani shirt, crisp with starch. Matching tie. Patent leather shoes.\n\nDressed in the trappings of greed and wealth . . .\n\nThe telephone rings. Ali crosses the room to answer it. 'Yes?'\n\n'Dr Abukar, security has arrived to escort you through.'\n\n'Thank you. Please inform them that I will be ready in a few moments.' His voice is gentle, that of an educated man explaining a point of fact to his peers.\n\nLowering the handset, he takes a white plastic box from the bedside drawer. Examining it for a moment, recalling the instructions, he walks to the doorway, fixing it to the wall near the entry with its self-adhesive pad. He flicks a switch, and the light flashes, indicating that the infrared sensor will activate in sixty seconds.\n\n. . . I will die shahid for the glory of God.\n\nCounting down the time, he slips a dark jacket over his shoulders and collects the Manzoni leather briefcase from its place beside the bed. With the sensation of passing from one world to another, he leaves the room, closing the door behind him.\n\nMoving down the corridor towards the residential wing of the conference centre, Marika Hartmann stops to adjust the black gun belt that loops around her waist, the webbing digging hard into her hips. As an afterthought she folds up the cuffs on her dark blue overalls before striding towards the elevators.\n\nAs she walks, her eyes roam through the glass and along the coastal strip — the line of international hotels beginning with the Sheraton and Royal Mirage, all the way to the thirty-nine-storey Burj al-Arab, shaped like a dhow on its artificial island. Further down: the long, sweeping Jumeirah Beach, and the City Centre, shrouded in dust borne on searing desert winds.\n\nThis is Dubai, where for generations oil dollars have come home not only to roost, but to crow. The Palm Jumeirah. Mall of the Emirates. The glass-faced skyscrapers that line Sheikh Zayed Road, dwarfed by the glorious Burj Khalifa. The minarets of private mosques, and wind towers rise from block after block of walled housing. To service this empire, hundreds of thousands of South Asian expatriates rise early each morning in the slums of Sharjah and commute to Dubai to sweep paths, clean windows, cook, and labour at one of the few remaining construction sites.\n\nOil revenues have fallen. Debt repayments are crippling the city. Half finished, abandoned buildings dot the skyline. Artificial islands that were planned to resemble the continents of the world lie like irregularly shaped sand bars out in the Gulf. After dark, Dubai is young and beautiful, adorned with diamonds and pearls. Under the merciless Arabian sun, however, the wrinkles are plain, and the gems are made of glass.\n\nMarika, taking one last look as she enters the elevator, draws comfort from the complex's proximity to the water; having grown up so close to the beach in the Sydney suburb of Bondi that she would walk home barefoot, hang her towel on the Hills Hoist in the backyard, over close-cropped lawns and yellow daisies. In her mind she hears the slamming of the screen door. The drip of salt water on the linoleum floor.\n\nSalt water. Impatient seas lapping at levees and flood barriers the world over. Heatwaves and firestorms once labelled by conservative science as ludicrous. The rise of the African Salafis, the Taliban of a new age. The collapse of national economies under the groaning weight of debt. The Secretary-General of the United Nations said it himself: 'This is a civilisation in crisis, a world on the brink. Only goodwill and honest effort can turn the tide.'\n\nA world on the brink. A self-perpetuating reality television show, where the media spectacularises violence to such an extent that the public can no longer differentiate the latest blockbuster film from twenty-four-hour news channels. A world where personal freedom is subjugated by ever more invasive rules, yet children grow up with unfettered access to internet pornography, social networking, and the undermining influence of American underculture. A world where acts of terror, even those of marginalised amateurs, attract publicity that becomes a goal in itself.\n\nThis is a world where the United States of America spends more money on its 'defence' than the rest of the world put together spends on theirs, maintains a thousand military bases at home and seven hundred overseas. Where the nuclear club includes some of the most volatile nations on earth and a million children carry guns and fight grown-up wars in thirty different conflicts.\n\nA world of startling inequality, where one per cent of adults own forty per cent of the world's assets. Where eighty per cent of the population lives on less than ten dollars a day, and fifty per cent lives on less than two. Where bankers and moguls draw salaries in the millions and dine with politicians who pass laws to perpetuate the system and maintain the status quo at all costs.\n\nAfter school, Marika entered Duntroon Military College as an officer trainee, completing a degree in Political Science at the nearby Australian National University. She was one of the first female frontline infantry officers in the Australian Army, women who were, for the first time, permitted to kill and be killed.\n\nSpecial Forces training, and a foray into Afghanistan, fuelled her need to understand why peace was so hard. She graduated top of her class in Military Intelligence, and a desire to be at the frontline saw her posted to Europe, cutting her teeth at the secret Alliance Base in Paris before volunteering for the new DRFS Directorate of Britain's MI6.\n\nAssignments that would never make the news took her deep into Pakistan, Africa – the Maghreb, and Sahel. The world changed constantly, defying experts. The Arab Spring took even the most insightful commentators by surprise, launched when Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire in a Tunisian market, catching the collective imagination of a generation of tech savvy but repressed youth.\n\nIn Mali, during a freak storm, Marika saw something that would be engraved on her soul. She was stationed in the village of Yanfolila, after reports filtered through of a militant training camp in the area. A 'secret base', that turned out to be a few teenagers and old men with guns who dreamed of glory.\n\nWaiting for a chopper pick-up in a makeshift LZ, Marika watched a man and woman build a house. They cut poles and bearers from acacia trunks, then weaved together thousands of dry branches to make up the walls. Next the woman carried wet clay from the river and, in a purpose-built pit, the man mixed it with cow dung and dry straw. They laboured to fill the spaces between the laths of sticks, packing the clay in tight to provide a weatherproof seal.\n\nWhen it was done, just as they began weaving palm fronds for the thatched roof, a storm blew in from the west. Torrential rain followed. Husband and wife slapped on more fresh clay, trying to hold it together — yet they had only two hands each, and as soon as one place held, another began to subside.\n\nThe rain continued and they became distressed, hands plastering mud over the sticks while the rain washed it away. One or two neighbours, even Marika herself, came to help. More hands, but never enough, trying to keep the mud from washing away. Impossible without fresh straw, dry clay, without more hands, more hands . . .\n\nThree floors up, Marika leaves the elevator and moves along a passage carpeted in mauve, prints of famous artworks on the walls. Dwarf neanthe palms and cynerium grass grow in clusters in pots designed to resemble local bronze-age handiwork.\n\nDr Abukar greets her with a bow and a tap of his chest with the flat of his hand. His features are soft, almost feminine, with narrow wrists and wire-rimmed glasses. This morning, his usual nervous manner seems heightened. Dew-like sweat coats his forehead, despite the air conditioning. He's got the shakes. Poor man is about to address a thousand people. Ambassadors. Vice presidents. Ministers of state . . .\n\n'Follow me, please, sir. I trust you had a pleasant night?'\n\n'Yes, yes, of course.'\n\nSole occupants of the elevator, they descend in tense silence. Marika says nothing about the change in him. Temperamental delegates are part of a job that has been, so far, a pleasant experience, with just the usual escort and monitoring duties. Security for the conference is provided by a partnership between the Dubai police, and international security organisations, including the DRFS.\n\nThe door slides open. Dr Abukar touches her arm. The expression on his face is strange, almost apologetic.\n\n'The world is not a fair place, Miss Hartmann.'\n\nThe declaration increases her feeling of unease, but she says nothing, merely nodding to acknowledge his words.\n\n'Just a short drive from here,' he continues, 'you will find shopping malls filled with designer stores. Armani, Dolce and Gabbana, Gucci, Chanel, Piaget, and many others. They tell me that you can purchase diamond-encrusted sunglasses, with a price tag of just over three hundred thousand US dollars. Sunglasses! And designer dresses can cost enough to feed a village for a year. Within a few thousand kilometres of where we stand, in Africa, fifty million people are unable to procure sufficient calories to sustain themselves. Women from twelve to forty years bear children they cannot feed. Have you ever seen a child dying of starvation, or of AIDS?' His eyes are earnest, almost pleading. 'In these last five years of drought and heat, the number of starving Africans has increased by a million people a month. Now that the rising seas — what my people call the Daad — has begun, there will be many more.'\n\nThey step together onto the carpeted walkway. Other groups pass by — UN officials, aides, and journalists. At twenty-metre intervals, Dubai Special Forces troops in grey combat fatigues stand with French-manufactured FAMAS assault rifles either slung or cradled in their arms, grey badges on their chests and dark blue berets tilted over close-shaved heads.\n\nA checkpoint looms ahead, resembling an airport security barrier, with twin aluminium gateways and a low table. Marika takes Dr Abukar's briefcase from his hands and places it on the conveyor, watching as he steps under the arched metal detectors and body scanners. The security protocol is rigorous, foolproof.\n\nThe guard opens the case and looks perfunctorily inside: at the sheaf of papers in a manila document wallet; paracetamol tablets, a bottle of mineral water and an apple.\n\n'Thank you,' he says, 'enjoy the conference.'\n\nAli Khalid Abukar has a sense of unreality so wild it is like lysergic acid pulsing through his veins and infiltrating the frontal lobe, seeing himself through cameras on either side, imagining the security services studying each nervous pace, knowing his intention like mind readers.\n\nAn attractive woman in her mid-thirties hurries towards them. Blonde hair, stylish clothes — neat dark skirt suit, silk scarf. Left shoe scuffed, a button undone halfway down the jacket. Up close, her eye make-up seems to have been unsteadily applied. A name tag identifies her as Isabella Thompson, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In one hand she carries a briefcase identical to his.\n\nThank God, she is here — just as Zhyogal promised.\n\nApproaching him, she stands closer than would normally be considered polite. 'Dr Abukar?'\n\n'Yes?'\n\n'I wanted to say how much I admire your work. I just finished reading your paper in the Harvard Human Rights Journal. The one on corporate complicity in African poverty.'\n\n'Ah, yes. You liked it?'\n\n'Liked isn't the right word. It was horrifying.'\n\nWatching from the corner of his eye, Ali sees the security woman's attention wander, gazing out through the glass to where, behind wire barriers, a thousand or more protesters clash with police, surging backwards and forwards like a tide, shouts just audible through the armoured glass; a moving, swelling mass of waving arms and placards.\n\nThe exchange of briefcases takes only a moment. Ali feels the weight, the power of the thing, and slippery sweat coating the handle.\n\nIsabella Thompson prattles on. 'It affected me a great deal, and now I look forward to your address this morning.'\n\nAli inclines his head. 'Thank you. I'd best hurry, or I will be late.'\n\nThis is no longer a dream, but reality. He forces himself to breathe, conscious of a growing feeling of vertigo. He has the briefcase, the power to change history, and even the guard who walks beside him does not suspect.\n\nContinuing down the corridor, the entrance to the conference room comes into view, resembling an oversized bank vault. Guards stand on either side. A backlit screen, shiny as a mirror, blinks up the day's agenda in letters two hundred millimetres high. Ali tries not to focus on his own name. It looks too solid, too respectable. At odds with what he is about to do.\n\nAt a distance of some twenty metres, he stops walking, standing with his breath burning hot in his throat. The protesters' cries sift through the glass. He stares myopically at the animal that has just caught his eye. A German shepherd — russet brown and gold, handsome and massive. The handler half kneels with one arm around the animal's neck.\n\nWatch for kufr police dogs, Zhyogal warned him. Despite the masking agents we have used, they may take the scent. Watch for them. Avoid them. Insha' Allah, you will get through.\n\nThe guard walks on for a few steps before noticing that he has stopped. She turns, eyes narrowed. 'Doctor? Is something the matter? We need to hurry.'\n\nHe removes his glasses, working at a lens with his handkerchief. 'I am sorry, Miss Hartmann, but I do not like dogs. They frighten me . . . a great deal.' He watches the handler pat the animal around the ruff, muttering endearments, slipping something from his pocket and into the palm of his hand.\n\nAgain the security guard urges him on, brown eyes earnest, pleading. She has a nicely formed face, he notices, with cheerful lips, an upswept nose and high cheekbones. Unconsciously, he is pleased that she will not be inside the auditorium at the final moment.\n\n'I'll walk between you and the dog,' she says. 'Please. We can't keep them waiting.'\n\nAli moves to her far side, takes the first step towards the entrance. The animal sits up, ears cocked, then whines and starts forwards. The handler takes a double turn of the leash around his hand and walks after them, calling out in accented English, 'Excuse me?'\n\nAli walks on twenty or more steps before he stops. Amplified voices from the chamber echo through the walls. He looks ahead, sees the Englishwoman again.\n\nThank God she is still here.\n\nThe dog handler follows, trying to control the animal. 'Excuse me. Surely the dog is mistaken, but . . .'\n\nIsabella Thompson is on the spot in a moment, hands on hips. 'How dare you be so impertinent? This man is due to address the conference in a moment. Your dog is as poorly trained as you are ill-mannered.'\n\nThe animal seems to lose interest at that point, turning to look back down the walkway. The handler lowers his eyes. 'Of course, madam, please accept my apologies.' With a jerk on the leash he steers the dog away.\n\nMarika watches Isabella Thompson escort Dr Abukar into the conference room. Disquiet narrows her eyes. Why did she react so strongly to the dog handler? Why was an FCO diplomat outside the conference room at all?\n\nThumbs in her pockets, Marika hovers near the entrance. Even now she is not worried. The room is secure. Hydraulically operated steel doors are hidden in the jambs, capable of isolating the room from any threat, to be opened again only with cooperation from both inside and outside. Marika has studied the specifications — manufactured by the German engineering firm Schroeder, weighing three-point-four tonnes, sealed by a chemically resistant polymer. The double-skinned 316 stainless steel face, thirty-five millimetres thick, will defeat any but the most determined, industrial strength attack.\n\nAn amplified voice echoes out through the walls. 'Please welcome Dr Ali Khalid Abukar, one of a number of silent achievers who has worked at the coal face of international aid. He holds a PhD in Human Rights and Democratisation from Debub University in Ethiopia. Dr Abukar sits on dozens of committees including the Economic and Social Council and the Committee for Climate Change in Africa. He is widely published, and speaks eight languages . . .'\n\nSwallowing her unease, telling herself that she is foolish to have misgivings about this gentle man, Marika climbs a discreet set of stairs up to the control room. This area is longer than it is wide, crammed with 3D monitor screens, and young men and women tapping at keyboards.\n\nMarika has met more than a few of them; drunk Stella Artois at the bar with the non-Muslims, most of them delegates from various security forces from around the world. Nikulina, the Russian, lifts his eyes from the screen to give her a wave, black body hair crawling out of his cuffs and halfway down the backs of his hands.\n\nThe gaunt frame of Abdullah bin al-Rhoumi, Head of Security for Rabi al-Salah, Director of GDOIS, Dubai's General Department of Organisation, Protective Security and Emergency, dominates the room. He turns to look at her as she enters. Eyes like cameras. In just two weeks they have developed a close rapport.\n\n'Is something wrong?' he asks.\n\nMarika shakes her head. 'No, I don't think so.'\n\nVarious camera angles from inside the conference room are projected onto a series of screens mounted along one wall, as well as smaller monitors scattered around the room. Marika reverses a chair and sits with folded arms leaning on the back, watching the feed from a ceiling-mounted camera as it pans around the conference room — a vast space, eighty metres by one hundred and ten, an amphitheatre with eighteen concentric rings of benches, all made from the latest mycobond organic plastics.\n\nRepresentatives of nations sit in rows flanked by aides and advisors, equipped with wafer-thin touch screens that allow them to call up the databases — the proportion of women dying in childbirth in Africa and Asia; AIDS deaths per capita; seismic patterns and predictions; melt rates of the polar ice caps; global temperatures; national debt for every nation — the maddening, depressing, endless statistics churned out by the committees and agencies of the United Nations.\n\nThe camera settles on Dr Abukar, reaching the dais, using a shaking forefinger to push the rim of his glasses up off the bridge of his nose, rubbing the area. So nervous. Too nervous?\n\nMarika rationalises that he is about to address a television and online audience that might number in the billions. It's OK. There's nothing wrong. Just another speech. A gabfest; a talkathon.\n\nThe general cynicism in the control room about the conference surprises her. No one Marika has talked to believes that this latest summit will achieve anything at all. Yet surely it must — here are the leaders of every nation. The President of the United States, surrounded by a dozen aides and assistants. Britain's Prime Minister. The leaders of France, Australia, Canada, Germany, and a hundred other nations, veterans of Copenhagen, Cancún, Durban, and Rio+20. All have agreed that they must act now to prevent what has been described as the end of Western civilisation.\n\nThe camera zooms in on Dr Abukar taking a folded paper from his top pocket. Something moves in Marika's gut. Why would he carry his speech in his pocket? Why not in the briefcase? Why did he bring the case at all?\n\nTurning her head, Marika sees Abdullah still hovering, eyes haunted with the same fear they all know. That something will happen.\n\n'Sir,' she calls. Sharp and clipped.\n\nFor a man of his years, Abdullah reacts fast. She knows already that his hearing is near perfect, and that he is fit enough to run a regular ten kilometres with the rest of them, albeit at the rear of the pack.\n\n'Yes?'\n\n'There's something wrong.'\n\nDr Abukar, on the screen, clears his throat and begins to speak. 'Good day to you. My name is Ali Khalid Abukar. I have worked for the United Nations for twenty-six years.'\n\nThe control room freezes. All eyes are on her. Marika wonders if she is about to make a fool of herself.\n\nAbdullah's mouth sets in a single hard line. 'What do you mean?'\n\n'The briefcase, maybe. Oh, hell . . . I don't know.'\n\n'The West,' Dr Abukar continues, his voice taking on a new gravitas unmistakeable even over the speakers, 'is a gluttonous pig, wallowing in unrepayable debt and consumerism, stripping the world of resources faster than they can be replenished. Policies of intervention in order to secure these natural resources are dividing the world.'\n\nMarika feels her breath catch and has to force herself to resume breathing.\n\n'The Western economic system, after many warning shocks, is on the brink of collapse. Bankers and company CEOs, whose greed has fed this unsustainable cycle, collect obscene salaries while others starve. European nations who have stripped the world to sustain lavish lifestyles, first with colonialism and now with debt, face bankruptcy and ruin. Soaring temperatures caused by industrialised countries threaten the Third World. Rising sea levels, hurricanes, floods, drought. Unprecedented seismic activity. Famine. Today, I act for my people. The dispossessed, the starving, the millions in refugee camps and on the road. I act for every child screaming out his hunger in the night, and each baby born into a family who cannot feed, clothe or educate him. I act for the thirty million souls now fleeing famine and disaster in Africa and Asia . . .'\n\nMarika locks eyes with Abdullah. There is agreement in that gaze. Better to act now and look like fools than to . . . He barks two names into the lapel transmitter. 'Shadi, Badr, get him out of there. Him and the briefcase. Now. Go.'\n\nMarika watches the two men at extreme sides of the conference room converge on the dais, feeling herself tingling from head to toe, floating off in space, cheeks flushing — about to disrupt a speaker at the most important international conference in a decade. Rabi al-Salah. The breeze of righteousness. Eyes flick back to the screen and Dr Abukar's words continue to sear into her head.\n\n'I come here today as the instrument of the true God. The God of Mohammed. The God of Mercy. Having realised that there is no other way but for men and women everywhere to submit to His wisdom.'\n\nMarika's eyes lock onto the screen. She whispers, 'God no. Please, don't let it happen . . .'\n\nThe two security guards approach the dais, clearly visible, but Dr Abukar opens his hand, revealing a black plastic switch, holding it high so there can be no doubt.\n\n'Go back,' he shrieks, 'No one must come close. This briefcase contains eleven kilograms of high explosive . . .'\n\nPandemonium. Voices crash out through the room. Marika's lungs stop dead, as if captured by a barbed hook.\n\n' . . . the device will explode by remote control. I can close the circuit by pressing this switch. If I am attacked, or physically threatened, I will trigger the explosion. My initial instructions are for all security staff to leave the conference room, and the doors and windows sealed.\n\n'My next requirement is for your security forces to allow a group of my comrades to enter this room. They will arrive at the Ja-noob car park by motor vehicle. Please let them through without delay.' His voice becomes hollow and empty. 'If these instructions are not followed I will kill most of the men and women in this room. For those who doubt the authenticity of this threat, I have left samples of these explosives in my room on level three at the residential complex . . .'\n\nAt sixteen years of age, the East Sydney Bushwalking Club, with its close affiliation to the Wilderness Society, drew Marika in like a slow-moving vortex. Journeys into the forests and woodlands of eastern Australia became her passion. Weekend treks deep into the Blue Mountains, the Warrumbungles, the Budawangs; the trusty green Karrimor pack sweaty against her back while she negotiated steep ridges with that dry grass crunching beneath her boots.\n\nCampfires in deep riven stone gorges, songs echoing from the cliffs. As she moved overseas for work, more opportunities presented themselves. South Africa's Drakensberg; Canada's Rockies above Banff in summer with air like cold crystal through which she could see a hundred miles of dark, snow-capped stone peaks. Once or twice it had all gone sour. A fall here and there, a twisted ankle, and once, in the rugged Gledíc mountains of Serbia, a flash flood punching through the valley floor at three in the morning. A wall of water pouring through the tent, picking it up and tossing her around as if in a washing machine, leaving her bruised and battered, recuperating in a Trstenik guesthouse for days before she was able to continue the holiday.\n\nThis memory flashes across her consciousness as the speaker stands back from the lectern. The same disorientation. Images. Visions. Passing into the cortex but not responded to. The sound of hydraulic motors and moving machinery.\n\nDreamlike and surreal. The control room goes from order to chaos. Chairs crash sideways. Nikulina's coffee falls, droplets of brown liquid spilling up like high tide. Sunflowers in a vase on the sill. Shouts and running. The screen going blank as the man inside cuts off communications, leaving them blind.\n\nMarika is unable to move, deep in a shocked spell she cannot break. A click as the giant door seals slide into place. A helpless cry from inside the room.\n\nSilence from below as the protesters stop the shouting. Time passing. A cheer, stifled and high pitched from somewhere, then a crash. A burning vehicle on its side. Security forces trying to cordon off the complex, pushing the crowd away violently now. The sound of a gunshot, then another. A flush begins in her cheek and burns all the way across her neck and face.\n\nMarika runs down the steps, head pounding, mouth dry. Dr Abukar's words ring in her ears: I have left samples of these explosives in my room on level three at the residential complex.\n\nAt the first checkpoint plastic chain gates have closed. An agitated security guard asks for identification, and they are forced to slow. Troops brandish automatic weapons, looking for a target. Marika gets through last, begrudging every moment of the slow examination of her ID.\n\nNikulina and three young Dubai policemen are ahead of her now, down the long corridor into the residential complex. Marika makes up ground on the straight, then turns into the stairwell, faster than an elevator for just a couple of floors. The steel capped shoes of the men in front ring on the marble steps.\n\nReaching the floor above, swinging onto the next flight of stairs, Marika recognises the danger. Dr Abukar will not wait for forensics and processing labs to test his samples. The demonstration of the efficacy of his explosives will, by necessity, be immediate. God, how can such a gentle man do this?\n\n'Stop!' she screams at the others, but the sound of echoing feet drowns her out. She tries again, throat tearing with the strain, then attempts to move faster, knowing that the men ahead are as fit as she, and probably a little quicker.\n\nWhat had he said that morning? Fifty million people unable to procure sufficient calories to sustain themselves. Is this his way of redressing the balance?\n\nThe sound of a door opening so hard that the handle pounds against the wall. Footsteps receding. Marika makes the third floor in time to see two figures sprint away down the carpeted corridor.\n\n'Stop!' she tries again.\n\nMarika comes around the corner as Nikulina opens the door to room 308. He is two paces inside when there is a roar, and a flash of light, the explosion slamming him back against the corridor wall, collecting a Dubai police sergeant on the way. Marika's ears ring, and her feet falter from the proximity to the blast. An explosive stench fills the air, mingling with the burned pork smell of Nikulina, his body and clothes smoking.\n\nSirens whoop through the sudden stillness. Hesitating at the door, Marika clears her head and charges inside. Blackened, cracked, sagging plaster. Shattered windows. Flames scale the curtains like rope climbers. Cotton bed sheets smoulder. No sign of human presence.\n\nOut in the corridor men scream for medics. Others move inside. Marika backs away, eyes streaming from the gathering smoke, throat burning. Forensics will comb the room. There will be nothing to find here until they have done their work.\n\nFrom deep within rises a terrible and irrepressible guilt. One man is dead. One injured. More will surely follow.\n\nThe nine mujahedin stroll through the checkpoints like celebrities. Some are pale skinned, some dark. Most wear full beards, jeans, T-shirts, and light jackets.\n\nMarika stands back with the rest of the security staff, lining the corridors, helpless and sullen as the mujahedin pass through, pausing to pull compact automatic weapons from sports bags. Marika recognises an Uzi, and a PM63.\n\nOne walks ahead of the others, his cheeks sunken and lean, proud and watchful, with the glare and stride of a predatory animal. Marika realises that Dr Abukar is not the architect of this event. Here is the real commander, and her job is to know such people. Her mind trawls through hundreds of grainy snapshots. The leaders have histories. All of them do.\n\nThe man who walks in front of the others is known to Marika from just two file pictures. The name he goes by is Zhyogal. Hunted on three continents. Key member of the African Salafi terror group, known as al-Muwahhidun, or Almohad. Spearhead of the new wave of terror.\n\nPlease God, not them, she pleads. Please, why did it have to be them?\n\nThe antechamber is almost empty of people now, but those who remain cower back from the nine men as they walk through the entrance, into the amphitheatre, down the tiers and to the front. The gunmen take up their positions around the room.\n\nHead thrown back, face engorged with blood, veins and tendons standing proud on his neck, the leader raises his right hand, index finger pointing skywards. The others follow his lead, all shouting, 'Allahu akbar.'\n\nZhyogal's voice is filled with triumph and a religious fervour so visceral and powerful it might be sexual.\n\n'In the name of God, the most gracious and merciful. Your faithful have taken possession of this room and everyone inside it. Let the overlords of taghut, of tyranny, prepare to die.'\n\nThe main doors hiss closed and Marika stands, still staring, a feeling of dread in the pit of her belly.\n\nFaces recoil from the horror of what is coming, remembering stories and recalling images of beheadings and executions, each aware of their own mortality — that no matter how important a man or woman might be in this life, they are still no stronger nor less fallible than a beating heart and a collection of tissue and nerve endings.\n\nThe President of the United States, halfway through his term, imagines the media frenzy back home. Wonders how his media director will shape his image in the wake of this disaster. The Republican grip on power is tenuous at best, and is predicted to become even more shaky after the impending midterm elections.\n\nHow can this happen, he thinks to himself, when his country spends untold billions every year to hold back terrorism? When the sharpened point of the enemy is five hundred or, at most, a thousand, Islamists with the funds, skills and organisational backing to pose any real threat. He wonders how the little people of America will react if he is killed here. Wonders if anyone apart from his wife and three sons will give a damn.\n\nThe prime ministers of Britain and Australia tuck themselves back into their less ostentatious circles of advisors and force a phlegmatic front over the inner panic. And beneath it all is an unfounded, yet ingrained, belief that Western civilisation will always dominate.\n\nThey cannot win, because they are not like us. They cannot win because they do not have our institutions, our facilities, our industrial strength, and our veneer of invincibility.\n\nNeither man remembers the lessons of history: that it was no industrial power, but the Goths and Vandals who reduced Rome to a smoking ruin.\n\nIsabella Thompson, four rows back, feels the hammering of her heart, recites a prayer over and over again, the lone survivor from memories of Sunday school, the vicar's spinster daughter leading hushed voices from the front of the room, eyes closed and fingers interlocked.\n\nOur Father, who art in Heaven,\n\nHallowed be Thy name . . .\n\nIf You truly exist, if You love me You will bring my beautiful girls back to me now. You will remove these bastards from the face of the earth and give my girls back to me. I will do anything You want in return . . . give thanks for the rest of my life if only You spare them and bring them to me alive . . . and punish these men who stole them away from me . . .\n\nThe mujahedin place bricks of semtex, carried in the sports bags, around the room, wired together with thin red cable to a central control box. Wired to blow from the plastic remote control Ali Khalid Abukar carries: an electronic gadget so clever it uses fine tendrils of water as conductors, tuned to explode all the charges, including those in the briefcase.\n\nIsabella's eyes fix on Zhyogal — the lover's mask removed so that he is no longer handsome, but the face of death itself, with skin stretched tight as tissue paper over a kite frame, the sunken cheeks and the eyes recessed, showing the hatred freely now. For just an instant their eyes meet and there is no regret there, only triumph.\n\nShe feels other eyes on her. Her own people. It seems to her that they know she is the one who betrayed them. Betrayed those who employed and trusted her for so many years. Helped bring this viper into a room that holds the most powerful men and women of her generation. Of course they had not told her what was inside the briefcase, but she had known in her heart.\n\nHead in her hands, Isabella begins to weep. Wanting it to be over, knowing she does not deserve this. She has always been so sensible.\n\nUntil she met him in Nairobi.\n\nThe role of British assets in protecting and ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid to the refugee camps in Northern Kenya was politically sensitive, and it was her job to smooth the way. Hard, demanding work against bull-headed negotiators, many of whom saw the mere existence of the camps as a threat to national security.\n\nRami caught her at a weak moment — handsome, debonair, charming, apparently a financier. The meeting seemed to be an accident, a traveller sharing her table at the crowded Kengeles restaurant, unhurriedly engaging her in conversation.\n\nNairobi can be a lonely city, even dangerous when you are by yourself . . .\n\nAt first she resisted, but he was persistent. Cancelling a planned engagement at the embassy, she accepted his invitation to dinner.\n\nI'm single now. Hell, why shouldn't I have any fun?\n\nNightclubs frequented by Westerners in Nairobi are few, and have in the past been the target of terrorist attacks, like the grenade strike on the Mwauras Club that injured twelve people a few years earlier. Isabella hesitated when he first suggested they go dancing, but felt safe in his arms at the popular New Florida Club, the décor of which was once described by travel writer Paul Chai as looking like a spaceship crash-landed on a service station. Kelly and the children watched DVD movies back at the hotel while Isabella and Rami shared their first kiss.\n\nOn the second night she went to his charming suite at the Safari Club on University Road with its antique furniture and colonial feel, a willing subject to an intense and intelligent seduction. When she moved on to Yemen, trying to patch relations with a country devastated by the long revolution, he followed. They spent two more nights together in Aden.\n\n'My English rose,' he joked.\n\n'My desert stallion,' she laughed back.\n\nThe knowledge that the man who now patrols the conference room with a gun, touched her as a lover, makes her shake with anger and shame. When he catches her eyes it is with complete detachment. She glares back with all the vitriol and hatred that floods her soul, remembering that moment at Aden Airport when she realised that the girls were gone. Remembering how the luggage carousel blurred. How the man who had introduced himself as Rami gripped her arm.\n\n'What are you doing? You're hurting me.'\n\n'Stop drawing attention to yourself. Your daughters are safe, for the time being.'\n\n'Where are they?'\n\n'Safe. Listen to me. Continue your journey as planned. Tell anyone who asks that your daughters are with relatives.'\n\n'No, please, I need them . . . Rami.'\n\n'Shut up, woman, my name is not Rami. Listen to me. You will be contacted and given further instructions at Rabi al-Salah. Make arrangements to stay at the centre itself. If you alert police, or anyone at all, your children will die. Understand this. They will die a terrible death . . . I will personally cut their hearts from their chests.'\n\nIsabella looked at the man who had touched her in the most intimate way. Believing his words.\n\n'They are calling your flight. Board it. Now.'\n\nWalking on as if in a nightmare, holding back tears . . .\n\nDay 1, 12:00\n\nZhyogal's voice, when it comes, is the self-satisfied howl of a wild dog that brought down its victim in the night, of a cat with a mouse lying quiescent between its paws. The voice of an anti-god who promises destruction and death. That of a man who has sifted poison and hatred from a system of belief.\n\nFirst he restores communications with a flick of the bank of switches, then places both hands on the dais and glares out at the cameras and the delegations in their rows. 'On behalf of our brothers in all lands, we make the following demands. First, the United States must withdraw its troops from Saudi Arabia, home of the two most sacred Islamic sites, Maccah and Medina. If they do not, every person in this room will die.\n\n'The United States must disband its AFRICOM military command, and remove all troops from the continent: Somalia; Mauritania; Nigeria. States moving to Sharia law will do so without interference. Foreign journalists will leave these countries without delay, or every person in this room will die.\n\n'All Western troops, military advisors and security firms will abandon their crusade against the nations of Islam: Iraq; Libya; Afghanistan; Somalia; Pakistan; Yemen. They must withdraw immediately. Or every person in this room will die.\n\n'Catastrophic global warming is killing Africa and Asia. Coal-fired power stations will be shut down. Immediately. Coal mining will cease. Immediately. High-emissions industries will stop production. All major cities must provide free public transport . . . the manufacture of luxury goods must cease . . . the production of immoral products such as Western music and fiction books . . .\n\n'The governments of the West have seven days to act. If they do not, at the moment of Maghrib — sunset — on the seventh day, this room and everyone inside it will be destroyed.\n\n'I make the following arrangements for the physical needs of the people in this room. There will be no tea, no coffee, no cakes, no biscuits. At sixteen hundred hours this afternoon I will allow the main doors to open while supplies are brought in. The only allowable food will be United Nations-issue emergency humanitarian ration packs.' His voice rises. 'Let the leaders of nations eat what refugees eat, what the luckiest of those dispossessed by their policies subsist on. You are free to use the toilets but no cubicle door will be closed. You will know what it is like to lack privacy.\n\n'Finally, I warn that war criminals present in this room will be tried under Sharia law. Those found guilty will be executed, beginning one hour from now.'\n\nThe mujahedin appear at the ends of the rows, weapons gripped tight, waiting with that same hunting-dog eagerness, barely controlled savagery on their faces.\n\nZhyogal's face twists with rage as he goes on. 'These are the war criminals. Bring them to me. President Martin Bourque of France; President Edward Purcell of the United States; President Eitam Yedidyah of Israel . . .'\n\nThe mujahedin move in pairs, identifying the targets and sliding down along the rows, grasping men under the arms and dragging them back to the aisles and down the carpeted steps. One or two fight back, and their attackers respond violently, swinging rifle butts onto the sides of heads, depositing victims in a row on the carpet on the dais, pushing them down, and all the time shouting, 'Kneel, kneel!' Blood flows from nostrils and lips onto the carpet.\n\nThe voice drones on: 'Hussein Malik of Pakistan; Wasef Ansari of the Afghanistan Transitional Government . . .'\n\nMuslim leaders are treated more savagely than the Westerners, suffering hammer-like blows from pistol butt and boot, as if a special breed of hatred is reserved for them.\n\nSomeone shouts, 'For the love of God, leave them alone.'\n\nThe speaker is identified and a lone mujahedin leaves the pack, drags the man from his seat and beats him about the head until he slumps to the floor, a groaning, bloodied, mess.\n\nThe war criminals kneel in a row that extends across the dais, some shaking, others weeping openly.\n\nDay 1, 12:35\n\nSimon Thompson has flown everything from a Piper Aztec to a Boeing Y3, working his way up through the British Airways hierarchy from trainee pilot to first officer, and finally captain, four gold bars on his epaulettes. He has seen it all — force eight storms over Greece; flying through black, fortress-like cumulonimbus cloud formations with St Elmo's fire dancing on the wingtips; visited every major country on earth; and been propositioned in both the sexual and the criminal sense.\n\nStill, after ten years in the cockpit he loves his job, loves the rush as the full-bellied 747-8 rises up through thirty thousand feet, loves to see the Gulf from the air, set against the brown desert landscape of the Emirates.\n\nBeginning the initial adjustments that will see them land in some thirty minutes, he smiles to himself. With Dubai the scheduled stopover on the way to Singapore, he has two hours at the airport. Isabella will be busy at the conference, but Kelly has promised to bring the girls out from the Towers Rotana on Sheikh Zayed Road to see him. They'll have lunch, and talk a bit before he has to board. If he has time, he will choose a gift for each of the girls at the airport shops — a book perhaps. Frances, the eldest, reads teen romance novels that stop short of sex with vampires but make up for it with plenty of suggestive neck puncturing. Simon smiles when he thinks of her — a pretty girl, so attractive that one of Isabella's brothers mumbled once: Boys are gonna slash their wrists over that girl, you just wait and see.\n\nHannah, two years younger, likes fairy tales and spooky stories, when she can sit still for long enough to read more than a page or two. Her preference, of course, would be a new charm for her Pandora bracelet. Already she has six sterling silver charms, one gold, purchased from gift shops and jewellers around the world.\n\nIsabella might get away from the conference and bring the girls out herself. A little jolt of electricity sparks through his chest. Three months have passed since the separation, and still he wishes she did not look so perfect, that she would not smile at him in quite that way . . .\n\nLost in his thoughts, he looks up as Penny Maynard opens the bulkhead door and enters the cockpit, immaculate in her red scarf and dark blue British Airways blazer.\n\n'You wanted me, sir?'\n\n'Just thought I'd let you know that there might be some moderate turbulence on the way down — thermals off the desert. Could be a bit uncomfortable. Let the passengers know it's nothing serious, will you?'\n\n'Sure. Is that all?'\n\n'That's it, thanks.'\n\nThe door closes behind her, leaving a lingering and expensive scent. Simon half smiles to himself, enjoying the fragrance, while returning to the series of manoeuvres that will soon see the giant craft taxiing down Runway 12L at Dubai International.\n\nThe SELCAL light on the aircraft communications addressing and reporting system lights up, and a beep sounds, signalling a ground-to-air voice communication. Vince, the first officer, pushes the VHF-R microphone selector switch on the ACP.\n\nSimon assumes the call is routine, but Vince's forehead creases into a frown. Something is wrong. Vince is prone to the occasional overreaction, but not so obvious as this. A knot forms in Simon's stomach while he waits for the call to conclude. 'What's going on?'\n\nVince turns, shifting the mike to one side. 'Just had a message from ATC. The Rabi al-Salah conference. Isabella's a delegate, isn't she?'\n\n'Yes. She's there.'\n\n'There's been some kind of terrorist attack. The conference centre's locked down.'\n\nSimon's hands freeze on the controls. 'Jesus. They said the damn thing was impregnable.'\n\n'Apparently not.'\n\n'What happened?'\n\n'They don't know at this stage.'\n\nIsabella. Christ. Are you OK?\n\nSimon's next thought is for the girls. Kelly, the nanny, will be with them, but at best they will be worried. Panicked even. Intense pain, searing hot, comes out of the blue and settles in his chest. He takes the wheel, scarcely breathing, barely in control.\n\nWhen the plane stops rolling, Simon conducts the post-flight checks without thinking, waiting for the final straggler to leave his seat and get his hand luggage from the overhead locker, cursing how some passengers seem to think that lingering until last is a hallmark of experience. Finally, he takes his bag from a nook on the flight deck and hurries down the passenger tube.\n\nOne of the stewards calls after him. 'Sir, why are you taking your bag? Aren't you coming back?'\n\nSimon hurries into the terminal, where a crowd has gathered below a wall-mounted LCD screen. Al-Jazeera news footage shows the Rabi al-Salah complex from the air; the heavy beat of a chopper and the voice of a journalist, who cannot hide a note of triumph coming through the speakers.\n\n'The capitalist leaders of the West . . . forced to listen. Forced to eat the rations of the dispossessed; to live like refugees . . .'\n\nWatching for long enough to ascertain that so far there have been no deaths among the delegates, Simon moves on, through the colossal extravaganc\n", "final_result_str": "repair", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "eede7fb3-2fce-4752-a7bf-7b82cc01b1cb", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "need_repair", "evidence": "前置目录书籍"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "d6bbaeee-7026-4f75-bc40-98aaf8e66f8e", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "1. 书籍\n2. 语法错误不是很多"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "87280436-fc67-4a3c-b12e-97fbab123246", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "正常的小说"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "967653c9-46fe-4aa0-bd1c-53e87cb79f11", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 逻辑：句子间有关联性"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

He said he is going to create RD of about 4K for creating Emergency Fund.\nRest 6K in Equity MF for various goals. After Emergency Fund is in place he will include that 4K also into investing for future goals.\nHe said 3 months of expense as EF . His monthly expense include Home EMI about 25k + Household Expense 8K + other misc 5K\n25+8+5=38K*3= 1.14L as EF\nI advised him to keep aside at least 6 months as EF ie 38*6=2.28L+buffer and round off =2.5L\nNow the question is with 4k in RD it takes approximately 5 years (60 months) to create this EF\nInstead if he put in all of 10K surplus in RD it will only take 2 year to create same amount .\nI suggested him to put in 10K and make sure EF is in place first. But he doesnt want to miss out on opportunity available in market due to uncertainty to purchase more units with low NAV in his MF Funds\nSo What is best Keep 4K RD and create EF within 5 year (put in yearly bonuses will bring this to 3 years)\nOr\nRD for all 10K and create EF under 2 years (may be in 1.5 year)?\nHi\nEmergency fund need to be highly liquid… please dont go for RD.\nI guess the investor is so conservative.so i suggest him the below one\nHe can go for a sweep account . i shared u a link\nhttp://www.moneysavingshelp.com/2011/bank-2/how-to-get-higher-interest-on-your-savings-account/\nShort explanation:\nU are allowed to specify a particular amount above which it will be swept from your savings acc on a particular date of the month and kept in fixed deposits for every 1000 units. Their lies the advantage. say 10000 swept from my account i am withdrawing 1000 remaining 9000 will be getting the fd interest. Till the date when u with draw 10000 will be given fd interest.Many banks are offering this different names.\nEg. sbi saving plus account —Multi deposit option\nThis is a must one for every induvidual.\nAs the interest incurred on fixed deposits and RD are taxable.If he chooses this fixed deposit (Sweep account) he will get more interest and no penal interest will be deducted if you withdraw it intermediately.\nThis solves the purpose of emergency fund and also earns highest interest rate.\nShortcomings with the RD:\nU cant take out immediately (u are allowed with some interest deduction).\nless interest than fd.\nIn both the cases we need to pay tax on the interest. then why should he go for low interest scheme?\nif he wants some other option\n1. liquid funds and debt funds….\nIn this uncertain world we need to keep the emergency fund and that too liquidity is also important.\nHappy Investing!!!!!!!!\n", "final_result_str": "no", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "1850d929-612e-49f0-8035-3d5fed8552d1", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "网页：好像是针对印度的英文投资理财网页\n语法：错误48个，低水平写作\n营销型内容：关于投资理财的建议\n思路：讨论合适的投资理财方案"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "08b82bb4-754e-4f71-a8f3-e2bfa2c0f403", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "逻辑混乱，语法错误多"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "089e5600-1a83-4161-80e3-f7548e076dde", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "- grammarly：语法错误较多\n- 句子间的关联性较差"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "4e1f1d35-97ff-42fc-99be-45361080098c", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "投资理财相关\n语法错误53个"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

I maintain that because Tigger is a tripod that technically she’s only 3/4 of a dog and therefore falls under the dog limit… The rescue group we are fostering for has contacted Kris and told him that they are going to \"focus\" on finding Tigger a forever home before she becomes a permanent fixture. I think after 6 weeks she is permanent…\nIt’s not going to be a good day if they take my lil Tigger tot away. I have become a protective mommy and don’t think anyone else can take care of her like I can… Are they going to know that tripods have special needs and carry 60% of their weight on the front legs and shouldn’t jump up or down from heights and and and and…???\nGrrrrr.\nP.S.\nI’m thinking of running away with Tigger.\nI think you’re a great Mommy too!\nIs the rescue group trying to find a permanent home because your boyfriend isn’t all for adopting Tigger? I think your arguments for keeping Tigger are all great, it’s surprising that he hasn’t come around yet.\nHmmm, anyone else have suggestions that might help to change his mind?…..\nIt's better to hop on three legs than to limp on four.™\nLatest Tripawds News\nRead my story here.\n23 October 2008\nThat sounds like our home, my hubby wants only 3 (which is our limit in our city), and we have 5.\nWe had gotten down to 3, Calamity, Morgan & Trigger, when they announced the closing of the track. Munchie was in my kennel & totally in love with me. She actually had a group to go to in St. Louis and this group had a vested interest in her as they had placed her mom too. But Munchie ended up coming home with me. Hubby was ok with that as she quickly won him over!\nKade is another story. He is a nephew to Calamity & Morgan out of Kitty, their brood bitch sister. I had made a personal commitment to this entire litter that was racing at the track. When he was retired at the track closing I decided to bring him home to foster him. I wanted to make sure he got a great home. I also wanted a chance to place him with one of his 2 brothers I had already placed. Soooo, he is here as a \"foster\". My excuse for not sending him home yet is that he has not yet had his medical (still intact & no dental). With Calamity’s expenditures there was no extra money for him at the moment.\nNeedless to say, after all of this time, my hubby has come around & Kade is now a member of this family! He’ll be getting his medical this month as soon as my vet friend & I can find a day we can neuter him together (he’s crypted too – yuck!) and I’ll do his dental while he’s under. He had blood drawn this week to qualify him for the blood donor program too.\nKade is here to stay! And we have 5 greyhounds once again!\nI hope you find a way to keep Tigger too!!! I can already hear the love you have for that little tripawd!\nJanie & Calamity\nJanie & Calamity http://www.trix.....gspot.com/\nPnerissa & Tigger,\nI wish your boyfriend would look at the odds of Tigger finding a home who understands tripawds the way you do. She doesn’t stand much of a chance of finding a permanent home and you are right there for her! How can he not look at her and know that her chances of finding an excellent home are so slim for her. He’s just gotta change his mind. Yes, cuteness counts, and Tigger’s got to just start pouring it on!\nTigger just needs to be your dog; she just has to!\nLove, Blazer, Kitty Kimber & Mom (Vicki)\nNo, the rescue group always tries to find the dogs homes pretty quick. I think particularly before they \"wear out their welcome\" in the foster home (we’ve had several that have eaten the blinds, wall paper, chewed the legs of antique furniture, chewed the window sill, etc.,).\nKris’s main arguements are a) he can’t walk 4 dogs at a time (he gets up waaaaay earlier than I do and walks the dogs) b) if we keep Tigger then he can’t take in anymore foster dogs and they’ll die.\nKris takes the dogs twice a day (sometimes 3 times a day) on two mile walks (the route is 2 miles, so sometimes the dogs get 6 miles in). Gets the dogs plenty tired and keeps them out of trouble.\nKris has said that Tigger doesn’t get adopted in a couple of months then she can stay, so I’m hoping that her \"handicap\" works against her in that respect. We all know she’s not handicapped at least. 😉\nJust an update. So far my sabotage attempts to keep Tigger from getting adopted is going well. *evil grin* My precious baby will only let me put her harness on her for walks, and really only comes to me if called. *grins some more* She's still learning many tricks, like a one-legged scratch at the door to be let in or out (even though we have a doggy door). Did I mention she's scary smart? Now she simply watches what the other dogs do, and she copies them.\nBev & Tigger\nTigger got up at 3 in the morning and emailed the rescue lady a list of demands (special needs list), and also told her that she was running away. Who knew that Tigger could type? Anyway, apparently the rescue lady was quite amused and has left her with me instead of taking her to the shop.\nLet's see how amused the rescue lady is when she winds up on a slow boat to china courtesy of Tigger's plotting…\nBev & Tigger aka co-conspirators\nHahahaha! I knew Tigger had it in her! No one believes me, but my dog types, too! Yay!!! Now, Tigger won't have to go to that “gnarly” old shop with that rescue lady. By the way, who's rescuing who here? I think, Bev, that you are the one doing the rescuing! Man, I'd love to see that lady's face when that slow boat (hopefully, a sampan) arrrives to send her to China. You have a very smart dog there and you'd better hang on to Tigger. Tell your boyfriend that “thousands” of us are rooting for you to keep her (thousands of what, I'm not sure, but thousands of carrots count, too, and they root!)\nBy the way, my email address is: vriss@comcast.net if you ever need to do any further plotting. I promise to help in any way I can.\nLove, Blazer, Kitty Kimber & Mom (Vicki)\nHey thanks for the Tigger update. We are hoppy to hear that she’s still with you! Hang in there, I’ll bet she’ll officially be yours soon.

For example, if ice accumulates on an engine inlet of an aircraft gas turbine engine, such as on a leading edge or lip of the engine inlet, such ice accumulation may disturb airflow and affect aerodynamic performance. Moreover, ice pieces may break off and enter the engine, resulting in possible damage to the engine.\nKnown aircraft engine anti-icing (EAI) assemblies, systems and methods exist. Such known EAI devices, systems and methods may involve transporting hot air or hot gases from the engine's compressor, e.g., engine compressor bleed air, to the engine inlet to provide thermal anti-icing to the engine inlet to prevent ice accumulation. In addition, such known aircraft EAI devices, systems and methods may involve the use and installation of a complex assembly of structures, for example, link structures to support the supply ducts and/or seals to prevent leakage of the supply ducts.\nHowever, the use and installation of such known link structures to support the supply ducts may involve increased labor, time, and complexity to assemble and install. This may, in turn, result in increased manufacturing costs. In addition, such link structures may require the use of numerous installation and assembly attachments, such as fasteners, brackets or other attachment elements, which may add weight to the aircraft. Such increased weight may, in turn, impose a performance penalty with respect to the aircraft, i.e., increased aircraft fuel consumption.\nMoreover, known seals used to prevent leakage of the supply ducts may include the use of silicone based seals, silicone/metallic seals, and elastomeric seals, as well as carbon seals. However, such known silicone based seals, silicone/metallic seals, and elastomeric seals may not be able to tolerate the very high temperatures, i.e., about 800 degrees Fahrenheit, or greater, that may be required for the supply duct, the engine inlet, and surrounding parts. In addition, such known silicone based seals, silicone/metallic seals, and elastomeric seals may have limited wear resistance, may require time consuming maintenance and inspection procedures to be performed after installation and use, and may be difficult to install if only blind installation, i.e., by feel alone, is available. Further, known carbon seals may be expensive, which, in turn, may result in increased manufacturing costs.\nAccordingly, there is a need in the art for improved aircraft engine anti-icing (EAI) barrier assemblies, systems and methods for air vehicles such as aircraft.\n\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "4e2fee8e-10ac-4d4f-a531-9a892b62c332", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "发明专利内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "2f242a44-e84a-4f4b-b417-ffa21f4dc4ee", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "专利"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "7eaa39b6-55b2-48d5-aec0-59f6f3c337e0", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "1. 语句通顺\n2. 语法错误13"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "73353f0a-0010-4b51-8b83-7e9cb25e68f7", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 技术知识内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Technical Field\nThe present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a thin film device using an inter-substrate transfer technology for the thin film device.\n2. Related Art\nIn semiconductor application devices such as liquid crystal display devices (LCD) or electroluminescence (EL) display devices, plastic substrates are sometimes used preferably as base substrates for the reason of preventing breakdown caused by deformation or dropping impacts, flexibility, or demands for weight saving. However, since the plastic substrates do not have enough heat resistance for a high temperature process required for manufacturing semiconductor devices, it is impossible to form semiconductor devices on the plastic substrates by an ordinary manufacturing process.\nAs a technology for forming a semiconductor device on a plastic substrate, a transfer technology has been proposed, in which a semiconductor application device is manufactured by attaching an element-forming layer (a layer to be transferred, hereinafter referred to as a transfer layer), which has a thin film semiconductor device formed therein and is detached from a heat resistive transfer-source substrate, to a plastic substrate, the transfer-target substrate after forming the thin film semiconductor device on the transfer-source substrate. Such a transfer technology is described as “a peeling method” or the like in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications No. 10-125929, No. 10-125930, and No. 10-125931 in detail.\nHowever, electro-optic instruments or electronic instruments in recent years are required to be packaged in high-density and low profiled, and accordingly, the thin film devices manufactured using the transfer technology described above are also required to be packaged in high-density without increasing thickness.\n\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "4e68abd9-3af9-4133-b09f-adb5faeab09c", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "1. 膜设备制造方法的内容\n2 语句通顺，5个语法错误"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "2c640b64-d91f-480b-8796-027ed249c9af", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "专利内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "435e6518-0a29-4895-854d-93d756286532", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "通顺的专利介绍"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "e3aaddd5-697d-4af4-a905-4f1ec379fa43", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 知识性内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Honesty and truth don’t really mean as much to everyone as it does to each individual person, yet all the bullshit in life can fertilize. Insignificant or insatiable, words can piggyback on feelings, and a second glance is just as significant for another chance, or even an eye roll. We grow and change into different people we expect to be, and there’s hardly a person aside from who we use to be that can say, “you aren’t who I expected to be.” Whether we met expectations or bet expectations, the biggest disappointment is the appointment kept when time’s are harry, and no bigger bow to where you came from. Ask yourself, “are you ready?” as a joke and see if you give a laugh or take a deep breath first. Of course I don’t know what that means.\nAuthor Archives: Daniel C.A.S.\na mother to you\ntonne s’apriz mi\nsigh again that time goes on.\ntime is yours to wield, nonetheless.\ngood in and with\nyour time\nbe bad should you like,\nwhen you waste it\nwho you think you are is\nnot the end, after all.\nbut what you have made time\nEggs\nLet me tell you about eggs. I spent 2 months sleeping. I went to bed at 7pm. I’d wake up close to noon, maybe later. I had migranes, never had migranes before. I got them from sleeping. Everybody loves talking about sleep.\nWhen I was out of bed i rode a bicycle. I rebuilt it, speedy red color. I cycled because I needed a reason to get out of bed because of migraines from sleep. I didn’t cycle far, my muscles were getting used to it. I’d be at the pond writing, just so i could spend time somewhere other than in my bed. I tried to get home by bedtime. Aside from suicide this was the best I could disappear from the world.\nbut eggs. white, brown, organic or not don’t matter. Skillet, Spatula, eggs, skillet, and some milk.\nWhisk eggs with milk\npour the eggs into the HOT skillet slowly scrambling simultaneously. It cooks the eggs faster.\nGive the eggs a little brownness from the oil\nand the milk will have made the eggs really fluffy\nTry green onions next time if you liked it. Taking the time to cook a couple of eggs in the morning is my advice to anyone that wanted to try rebuilding their life again. middle-aged, down on cash and don’t have any friends you can think of calling… get the eggs, asshole! We gotta fix you, fast!\nTake the time and care to cook some really good looking eggs and then cleaning up before you eat. And that’s how you’re going to rebuild your ship, sailor. Remembering to tidy up the loose things on and around your world, you’d look like you were dancing and fixing your life.\nBecause I know that world you’re left in, sitting on a plastic lawn chair after turning down suicide. My first thought with the hammer in my hand was, “well, i just spared my own life.” I didn’t know what I was going to do with the hammer anyway. But how do you use a second chance like that. Probably retrieve all the notes. And cook a couple of eggs. I call ’em Pardon Eggs.\nSkip Everyday\nWhen I passed away the first time, I cashed in my chips of chaos for structure. No room for messes I couldn’t manage, straight lines only. However, one can never shed the roots from which they’ve come to fruition, so the chaos lingers. So I kept my chaos at bay with perpendicular angles and tectonic shifts, mentally and actually.\nThey say you can read a person by how they keep their room, and it’s true. From a room of acute and oblique, and laundry as carpet, I went to a Swiffered linoleum, and cubic IKEA shelves. Within those shelves, were where my micromanaged chaos lived. Juxtaposed eccentricity and ethereality, I thought it would maintain the structure in my life. But one can never anticipate the unpredictability of others.\nThe man who took me in and gave me a chance with a job I’ve only dreamed of, allowing me to pursue and collect the wonders of life that waited in single file, took his own life. He did so with taste, a Smith and Wesson Model 29, .44 Magnum. Dirty Harry’s gun. His head, cleanly taken off, and off with him, the stability he gave me. I haven’t had too much experience, with death, or maybe I have and repressed it’s memory. Wait, yeah I did, a close friend had died of hypothermia and blood-loss in New York City two years earlier, but I don’t think that counts. Okay, I’m bad with death.\nThis man helped mentor me into writing, and gave me a job under him, as his head editor. Now that he selfishly took his own life because of a divorce that robbed him of his children, I’m selfishly wondering about what job I can find next. Only a week has passed since the incident, yet, it is only a matter of time before the skyscraper of stability I’ve gained in my life, comes toppling over, leaving a rubble’d gravesite I can call my own.\nIt still wasn’t as bad as the first time I died, when my heart was wrung dry and kept in an oblivious girl’s dresser, but now I’ve no body, no heart, and what’s left of my soul isn’t strong enough to power to the flashlight I need to light my way.\nI can’t talk to anyone about it either, because I’m too stubborn to listen to their words. I’ve always found my therapy to be writing, especially in the state of despair. Though, lately, I’ve been finding myself writing things that sound like suicide notes. Not because I’ll soon run out of funds, some of the richest people are often the saddest people, but because nothing in this earth feels like it grips me to it anymore. We sometimes forget to show love to the things we love, and thus, are never prepared to show them to the exit.\nThe things in life we love, help us live; being without those things, help us leave.\nFiled under non-fiction rambling, stories\nJack Kurtilick Holds Rare Maltese Anfibidorian Hostage\n“…and some things in life hint to the fact everyone was meant to unequivocally suffer in due time. We all feel liberated by the sight of the ocean, though we can not live in it. We die, then return to whence we came. I may drink like a bastard now, but I’d like to call it training! How old are you? 18, 19? Breathing underwater seemed a bit more advantageous in opposition of knowing how to swim,” then Jack looked at me, sharpening his once roundish eyes,”are you sure you don’t want a drink, Daniel?”\n“I’m alright, thanks.”\n“There’s no shame in it, provided your laxed provisionally minimal, adherent regards towards Christian propaganda.” said Jack, pouring himself another scotch, straight. I paused for a moment because I had absolutely no idea what this drunk fucker was talking about. After gathering what was left of my mind, I understood his power; he spoke in jargon, like a doctor. No person has any fucking idea what the doctor is talking about, but the way they spoke allowed you to nod your head, accept, and receive a terminal death sentence. That’s how Jack spoke, though it could also be the half empty bottle of scotch on his end-table.\n“I’m really just here for, Eleanor. The Maltese Anfibidoria or whatever the thing is called… the, ‘FISH,'” I gestured quotations with my fingers, “means a great deal to her.” I couldn’t look Jack in his eyes. I mean, I’d want to kill me too, if my ex-girlfriend sent a younger, adept replacement to retrieve a prized, rare fish at our old apartment. I, then, glanced up as a fluke due to the absence of a response and locked onto his eyes, and to my surprise, only saw the eyes of an man misplaced from another world. Donning the eyes of, what seemed like, a passionate player who’d lost a chess match. Defeated by a kid with beginner’s luck. Hand on his glass, he peered closer. Then withdrew. Then spoke.\n“The ‘FISH,’ is in the back, Danny boy.” Jack said a he pointed towards another end of the apartment.\nAfter a moment, I spoke. “Thanks, Jack.” I started what must have seemed like the most awkward exit. As I was about to round the corner, Jack spoke.\n“Daniel,” I turned and faced him, “little Danny Smolensk knows where to go, if he were to change his mind about that drink right?”\n“Yeah… Danny S. knows.” I nodded and gave a half-assed non-military salute, about faced. I hadn’t known at the time that I would never see Jack again. He was to vanish on a fishing excursion. Jack really wasn’t a bad guy. I liked him.\nFiled under stories\nquickstopshopptopcyclops\nDaniel, then, questioned the possible outcomes his situation had harnessed. He thought about all his school chums of the past. Kenny was a successful drug dealer with no aims or aspirations to conquer anything besides making rent on time. Alan was simultaneously the premiere floral and compost adviser in the garden section of a Hall-mart, and Kenny’s number one customer. Marcus had a career as a high school nurse. He received a prestigious education, a prestigious degree, from a prestigious school, and now, at most, with vigor, applies band-aids and prescribes sleep in the nurses’ examination bed for an entire class period. He does so with undefinably prestigious passion. Even Daniel’s first high school girlfriend Kimberly, (which took place during Senior Prom, only) became a police officer and an internet wholesaler of unnecessary (ninja) equipment, and homemade jewelry. During high school, Kim tried out for both the cheerleading squad and the football team and stole a spot in one of those. She still, and has never never held a pom-pom. Daniel thought, all the things you could been could be found in the town you never had the intention of naturally dying in. The yearn for a meaning or a greater purpose in the world, only meant and amounted to how persuasive your excuses were.\nDaniel stood brooding in the pick a cart, any cart section of the market lobby, brooding over the accomplishments people he knew had made, and decided he could get over his silly inclination to drink, and accomplish the goal. Daniel changed the ringtone on his cellphone to one that would encourage him, as he placed the Alcoholics Anonymous pamphlet into an unused shopping cart. “Baby steps, baby. That’s how accomplishments happen,” Daniel thought, “how pathetic would I look if I couldn’t fulfill the only goal I’ve ever wanted to accomplish?” Bells were not rung, not a single toast was made, and not a facetious soul cheered or tackled.\nThe cart he unknowingly claimed with a pamphlet had a wheel that steered slightly to the left, but angled the cart sideways to compensate the piece of crap. “It’s no trouble,” he thought, “There! Now I’ve conquered this bitch.” And that’s when his cellphone went off. Confused at first, Daniel then realized the improbability of anyone else with “Paranoid Android,” (by Radiohead) as a ringtone was strong, despite his intention of having “No Suprises” instead. He reached for his phone in his back right pocket, brought it up to his face, and saw digits to a phone number calling. The number wasn’t saved among his contacts so it only showed up at a number with a vaguely familiar area code. “Hello?” Daniel asked, with one hand holding the cart at course-compensating angle.\n“I knew it was you, I saw you in the parking lot,” pause. “I can’t believe you still have the same number! It’s been like, ten years!” said the male voice in a dizzyingly enthusiastic manner.\n“Yeah, my lucky set of numbers. They’ve always reached to me, in a way.” Daniel said dryly as he looked at the different sauces that were meant to change the way the fish tasted. Daniel believed everyone he ever knew were like fish with many kinds of sauces lathered on them which was meant to suppress much of the distaste they initially came with. He placed the sauce jar back on the rack. Daniel was always a black coffee, salt and pepper, on-the-rocks, kind of guy. He thought, “if some fucker took seven measly minutes to ponder then invent these things, how rude would I be to suggest they should’ve done this or that, instead? That’s like telling the bartender you liked his idea for a drink, respected the faith he had in it’s glory, and then telling him not to quit his “day job,” as you slowly finished his drink.\n“Haha, you’re funny! I was afraid what they said was true about you Hollywood types; you say what the writers say, and laugh when a casting director has something you want,” said the voice, “and plus the drugs and booze therapy that EVERYONE ELSE has to pay for.”\n“I haven’t gotten to the drugs yet, but, the year doesn’t end for another six months.” said Daniel, after realizing he, and the world lurked in the birth-month of the first and only love he’d ever had.\n“Yeah sure, what are you getting in there? Better be some fuckin’ sour cream and onion potato chips. I’m coming in to make sure.” After realizing the caller’s identity,\n“Son of a bitch, I don’t believe it. Kenny? Is that you?”\n“Yeah, baby! If you’re not in the Chips section, I’m gonna fuck your mom. How’s she doing?”\n“Good question.”\n“Sorry, I forgot. Come say hi and hold hold my hand, faggot.”\n“That’s rude, even for you.”\n“I said I forgot!” Kenny pleaded. “Sorry!”\n“No, the other thing.”\n“Oh. What, you went fag in Hollywood?” Kenny used fag in his daily repertoire, despite it’s context, though he did have shining qualities. He despised animal abuse so much as to not wear leather. Like a vegan. Kenny had no problem eating them.\n“No.” Daniel couldn’t stand arguing with him over political corrections. They never ended, though each of Kenny’s points became less and less sensible. The problem with it, Daniel thought, was that Kenny believed every word he said.\n“Whoooooa there, Mr. Hollywood, I’m just kidding. It’s fine if you’re a fag.”\n“Things don’t change around here, do they?” Daniel said as he placed a bag of sour cream and onion chips on top of the twelve pack of the cheapest beer he found, which was on top of the Alcoholics Anonymous pamphlet. Drinking was like a camera lens filter, blocking or accenting the malicious and unnecessary elements of the immediate world for the photograph. Daniel drank to filter out the idiocracies and hopelessness of life.\n“What? Everything’s changed, man. Hey, I see you.” They hung up. Daniel looked around and found Kenny. He was wearing fitted jeans, dark blue running sneakers, a plain white T-shirt, and his football Letterman from high school. Outside the new lip-ring, Kenny dressed like Kenny.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "34f0e357-3de9-473e-8ea4-bf2d8c706690", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "聚合性文学创作，过于抽象"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "8c470bfa-5f4b-41ca-ad21-f57897b5561a", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "作品合集，有故事有诗歌"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "f83a36be-f591-4db3-aee3-374fd0f21f1c", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "- 逻辑：句子之间的逻辑性牵强，不好理解。"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "d949631e-dcfa-404a-a66b-ed601ec3e506", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "内容不健康"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Uncertainty about whom to date. Whom to love. Who loves you back. Where to work. Sometimes how to pay the next bill. How to cook. Should you venture out to that movie or restaurant alone or wait for a friend to join you? Should you buy a house or keep renting? Try online dating or play it safe? (And then sometimes you venture onto an online dating site briefly, only to get hit on by a man three times your age who is proudly posing with his prized stuffed turkey in his profile pic, and you dart quickly back to the certain path of safety. This is a strictly hypothetical scenario, of course.)\n\nEvery single day reminds me of the many, many uncertainties of single life . . . and how those same uncertainties brought me here, to this place, as a writer. As a blogger. As an author. As someone you have invited into your world, at least for a little while, by reading these words.\n\nJust six short years ago, I was trapped in a toxic, abusive relationship that would ultimately change everything about my life; I just didn't know it at the time. Night after night after night you could find me hidden away in my bedroom in the apartment I shared with my agnostic boyfriend, crying out helplessly to God from one of the darkest corners I'd ever found myself cowering in. God's grace is big enough to cover sinful decisions, as it turns out. And it was during that time when I first began to really experience and embrace the beautiful uncertainty of not just believing in God, but of walking with Him. I knew without a doubt God was going to deliver me from that relationship; I just didn't know how. And at that moment, I didn't need to know how. I just needed to draw near to Him and trust Him.\n\nI became a Christian at age twenty. But I don't feel that I truly became a Christ follower until those nights of helplessness spent on my knees before Him six years ago. It took fleeing from an unhealthy relationship to send me running straight into His arms. I didn't have a close relationship with Jesus until that season of surrendered uncertainty made Him come alive to me in a whole new way. I knew _of_ Him, but I didn't _know_ Him. I talked _at_ Him, but I didn't listen _to_ Him. My heart was in the right place, and I loved Him, but I didn't seek after Him. I didn't pursue a relationship with Him. I didn't really listen to Him much at all actually. It must have made Him really sad.\n\nBut you know what? He was faithful, even if I wasn't. If you've read my other books, you know what happened next. A few weeks later I was free of that relationship and setting the only New Year's resolution I have ever kept: to write more and to find a way to inspire others with my story.\n\nGod met me there—right in the middle of my hopelessness, sinfulness, and powerlessness—and He turned my life around. He became _real_ to me. He didn't wait until I'd cleaned myself up to intervene. He didn't reprimand me before He redeemed me. And He also didn't hand me a roadmap before we started our journey together. He simply stepped in, took the controls, and started to rebuild my life one brick and one miracle at a time, always calling me to greater levels of trust and faith and boldness. Not because I had all the answers, but because I had finally surrendered to the One who did.\n\nOver the next five years, He would continue to guide me and prune me and use me, never failing to blow my mind as I watched Him work in and through my life to impact the lives of others. (Like you, there, holding this book.) Through my own trial and error, hijinks, heartbreaks, stubbornness, sinfulness, and humanness, He managed to do what I asked Him to do—make my story count—over and over and over again, sometimes in the most unbelievable, jaw-dropping, and, yes, even hilarious ways. (My walk with Him is anything but orthodox.) And the uncertainty I once ran from in my life—from being a planner and a controller and a completely neurotic, type A personality—I began to embrace in my life. The uncertainty of singleness. The uncertainty of completely surrendering to Him, no matter what. The uncertainty of stepping out in faith, even when fear and the certainty of playing it safe fought to hold me back.\n\nThe _beautiful uncertainty_.\n\nThen a little more than a year ago, I said a prayer that changed my walk with Him yet again.\n\nWhen I set my goals for 2014 and created my yearly vision board (you'll find instructions for creating your own board later in the book), I listed only one goal for the year. One goal. No other dreams or plans or hopes for my career or love life. What was that one goal?\n\nI will seek, pursue, and fall in love with Jesus with radical abandon.\n\n(Warning: _only_ say this prayer if you're prepared for your entire world to be rocked on its very axis.)\n\nOver the next year, I would see miracles abound: From the planning and implementation of a nationwide book and speaking tour in only a little more than a month, to the removal of a relationship that had left me in limbo for seven long years. From standing on a stage with my knees knocking in front of twenty thousand women at one of my biggest hero's conferences to finally finding the physical home where my soul belonged in the form of a beautiful ranch in the country.\n\n**I DISCOVERED THE BEAUTIFUL TRUTH THAT WHEN YOU SEEK FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS, ALL THINGS REALLY ARE ADDED TO YOU.**\n\nAnd, in my journey at least, I found that when you seek Him first, the things that aren't part of His plan are taken away.\n\nSo now I want to invite you to travel with me through that wonderful, painful, magical, challenging, life-altering year of highs and lows, tragedies and triumphs, snowstorms and earthquakes, high stakes and heartbreaks, great wins and great losses, and shedding tears and overcoming fears. On the pages that follow, you'll find essays, prayers, lessons, inspiration, and hopefully a little encouragement. You might even get so lost that you find yourself. And most of all, you'll find beautiful uncertainty. You may not find all the answers, but I hope when you're finished reading, you'll feel brave enough to start asking the questions—of yourself and of God (even the really hard ones).\n\nWhether you're idling in stubborn sinfulness or walking in seemingly never-ending singleness or living with any sort of uncertainty—waiting for love, waiting for marriage, waiting for babies, waiting for a cure, or a miracle, or a sign, or for God—I hope my journey will help make the wait a little easier and the uncertainty a little bit more beautiful.\n\nMy walk with Him has not, is not, and will never be perfect, but it is _real_. It's real and raw and messy, unclear and doubt-filled and, at times, rebellious. As I'm sure yours is. But it's the most beautiful walk I've ever taken. Because the destination doesn't matter. Holding His hand for the journey is enough.\n\nHe's always just enough light for the step I'm on. And His presence is always a beautiful certainty, even when absolutely nothing else is.\n\n_Prayer_\n\nGod help me to see the good in the \"not knowing\" . . . the joy in the \"in-between\" . . . the meaning in the \"meantime.\" \nPART ONE\n\n_Winter_\n\n_A Date with God_\n\nA couple of years ago a friend told me about a season she had right before she got married when she decided to spend six months \"dating\" Jesus. She told me she would fix Him a cup of coffee in the mornings and even reach over and buckle His seat belt when she would be driving somewhere. Her goal was to focus all of her time and energy on Him the way she had focused it on so many fruitless relationships over the years. It sounded incredibly intriguing (and also a little weird), but as I listened, all I could picture was me sitting in Starbucks talking to God in an empty chair across from me and being carted off the premises in a straitjacket.\n\nBefore I made a snap judgment about her sanity (or mine), however, I decided that—like a lot of things in life—you shouldn't knock it until you've tried it. I mean, if Jesus is alive and present and on the move in our day-to-day lives thanks to the Holy Spirit (which He is), who's to say my friend hadn't stumbled onto a really genius concept?\n\nA few days later I was in line at Zaxby's waiting to order lunch when I felt God begin to tug at my heart. \" _Order something for Me too_ ,\" I could feel Him whisper into my spirit. (And when I talk about God speaking to me, I should clarify that I've never heard an audible voice.)\n\n**HE LAYS THINGS ON MY HEART IN SUCH A POWERFUL WAY, I KNOW IT'S HIM NUDGING ME OR LEADING ME TO DO SOMETHING.**\n\nWhen I felt His gentle tug, I immediately started to argue with Him. \"But, God, Zaxby's is a little pricey. You want me to order a full meal for You that's just going to sit there and go to waste?\"\n\nAs soon as I responded to God with those words, I could just imagine him laughing at me. (Yes, sometimes I wonder if God is chuckling at my shenanigans. Often, actually. I think He must get such a kick out of me and my ridiculousness.)\n\n_\"Mandy. I give you breath and life and a heartbeat_ every single day _, and you can't spare seven dollars for Me?\"_\n\nSo I ordered God a chicken finger plate with extra Zax sauce, just like me. (I figured God surely loved Zax sauce since it _has_ to be the modern-day equivalent of manna from heaven.) And when I got home, I sat down at my desk with both our meals and started to eat. Now obviously God didn't beam down from heaven and join me for chicken tenders. But what followed was the sweetest thirty to forty-five minutes of communion with Him I had ever had. There was something so moving about sitting at my desk that day, quietly sharing a meal with the God of the universe. There was something even more moving about the fact that _He_ wanted to share a meal with _me_. Me. Little ol' me. Imperfect, greatly flawed, often the conductor of the Hot Mess Express _me_. And yet, there He was, standing at the door of my heart knocking, waiting to come in and eat with me (Revelation 3:20).\n\nI had gone into this experiment with no small amount of uncertainty, even a little hesitation, wondering if my simple offering was silly or pointless or even crazy, but I ended up eating my chicken tenders with tears rolling down my face and His presence hovering all around me.\n\n**THAT'S THE GOD WE SERVE. A DEEPLY PERSONAL GOD WHO WANTS TO BE A PART OF OUR MOST ORDINARY MOMENTS. IN THE BEAUTIFUL UNCERTAINTY OF OUR EVERYDAY LIVES, HE LONGS TO BE OUR MOST BEAUTIFUL CONSTANT.**\n\nLater, of course, I ended up eating the second meal myself. And I never regretted the seven-dollar investment, not even for a moment. Because I consider that day my first real \"date\" with God.\n\nIt was the best seven dollars I'd ever spent.\n\nBEAUTIFUL CERTAINTY:\n\nAs much of a mess as I can be, and as flawed as I am, I can honestly say my relationship with Jesus never fails to bring me great surprise and laughter and joy. If you don't have that kind of relationship with Him, it is my hope that this story (and this book) will inspire you. So much of the beauty, heart, and messy realness of Christianity is lost in our attempts to be perfect and to convince other people we are. And so many precious moments of closeness and intimacy with God are lost in our fear of being judged, or looking silly, or being afraid to approach Him as a _friend_. Just stop. Get real. Be who you are with Him, warts and all.\n\n**JESUS WON'T RUN FROM YOUR WEAKNESS, YOUR HUMANNESS. HE'LL RUN TO IT.**\n\nHe'll honor your willingness to seek Him above all else. And along the way, the two of you might even share a few laughs.\n\n_Prayer_\n\nGod, thank You that with You, even the most ordinary moments can be extraordinarily beautiful. Help me to come to know You, not just as a Father and as a Savior but as a Friend. \n_One Year, One Goal_\n\nBefore each new year begins, I usually fill a vision board with at least twenty to twenty-five goals and resolutions for the next twelve months. And over the past several years, I've seen amazing things happen and dreams realized that were lifted verbatim off my simple little dry-erase board.\n\nOn the cusp of 2014, however, I wanted to do things a little differently. I listed only one goal on my vision board for the _entire year_ :\n\nI will seek, pursue, and fall in love with Jesus with radical abandon.\n\nAfter writing that resolution on my vision board in late 2013, my life seemed to kick into overdrive. It was as though the shift in my priorities had shifted me to the next level! Things with my career were booming. The website and my social media platforms were thriving. My friendships were being strengthened. I even started getting healthier in my eating and exercise habits.\n\nMost importantly, my relationship with Jesus did indeed become the most precious, life-giving, and joy-producing relationship of all. I was taking time to meditate and be still and get silent and stop talking _at_ Him and instead listen _to_ Him. My life had never felt more hopeful and exciting, and, well . . . _alive_.\n\n\"Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.\"\n\n—Matthew 6:33 ESV\n\nIt's like God wanted me to see, really _see_ , that I never had to seek success at all. Or friendships. Or love. Or opportunity. Or anything other than Him. We hear the Scriptures and we learn the Scriptures and we recite the Scriptures, but when we actually _see_ the Scriptures lift right off the page and play out in real time, in real ways in our lives . . . it's awe inspiring.\n\nAnd the best part was, I didn't _want_ to pursue anything other than Him. The more He added to my life, the less I needed anything other than Him. It was the most perfect example of the upside-down way Jesus does things in His kingdom. The last will become first, the humble will be exalted, the poor will become rich. The more I had of Him, the less I needed anything else.\n\nTurns out, the more you seek Him and the more you find Him, the less you need the \"things.\" He is beautifully, perfectly, entirely _enough_.\n\nEXERCISE: CREATE YOUR OWN VISION BOARD\n\nCreating your own vision board is super easy to do, and the benefits far outweigh the cost! There's something powerful about writing out your prayers and dreams and goals and having them posted somewhere where you see them every single day. Plus, it's biblical: \"Where there is no vision, the people perish\" (Proverbs 29:18 KJV).\n\nI created my vision board from a plain white dry-erase board. It's as easy breezy as that. Most of the time I simply write my goals, dreams, prayers, and plans in list format, but occasionally I will tape some pictures up for added encouragement. You could also use a bulletin board if you prefer to have nothing but pictures for inspiration. Obviously, Pinterest makes for an excellent and endless source of material—from pictures to healthy eating plans to quotes and everything else in between!\n\nBefore you begin your board, I would encourage you to say a prayer and ask God to reveal what He would have you focus on for the weeks, months, or even year ahead. Had I not done that, I wouldn't have been led to write only one goal on my vision board for 2014, and the incredible year that followed might have never happened, including the inspiration for this book!\n\nYou can change your list as often as you want—or as quickly as you start checking off goals. You'll be surprised to see how being bold enough to lay out your dreams in black and white has a way of bringing them to life. And most importantly, hang your board in a place where you will see it at least a couple of times a day. I try to read through mine every morning when I wake up and at night before I go to sleep.\n\nYou don't have to wait for a new year, a new month, a new week, or even a new day to create your vision board. You can start now!\n\nHappy dreaming, praying, envisioning, pinning, creating, and realizing!\n_Coffee with Jesus_\n\nAs 2013 was drawing to a close, God had begun to shake my spiritual foundations to the core. I suspect so He could put down new ones.\n\nI had my one goal in place for the upcoming year and was attending a new Bible study that had revolutionized my relationship with Jesus. One night a wonderful lady stood up and gave her testimony about her quiet time with the Lord, and her words left me speechless. When she enters into her quiet time, she sits in her favorite place and visualizes she's there with Jesus, simply having a conversation with Him. Her place is her front-porch swing, but you can really pick any place that represents peace and calm and openness to you. (You can actually do this wherever you are, even if you are on the other side of the world from your special place. Just close your eyes and picture yourself there! That's the beauty of meditation.)\n\nWhy had I never thought of this before? Why had I just always talked _at_ Him and not _to_ Him?\n\nIn case the concept of spending quiet time with God is unfamiliar to you (as it was to me for a long time), it's basically taking time either within your normal prayer time or throughout the day to get silent before God and listen for His voice. The Bible tells us in John 16:13: \"But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come\" (NASB).\n\n**THE HOLY SPIRIT WANTS TO TALK TO US. BUT HE IS A GENTLEMAN. HE WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO COMPETE WITH THE NOISE AROUND US, OR SHOUT TO BE HEARD OVER NETFLIX, OR FORCE US TO LISTEN AT ALL, IF WE ARE DETERMINED NOT TO.**\n\nThink about it. If you had a friend who was always talking, talking, talking but never stopped to take a breath and listen to what you had to say, would the friendship last very long? Our relationship with God is much the same way. It can be either as shallow as we settle for or as deep as we are willing to go.\n\nWell, I decided I was tired of the kiddie pool. I wanted to go deeper with Him. I wanted to know Him more.\n\nI wanted to know Him all I could.\n\nThe place where I began to visualize myself talking to Jesus was in front of my fireplace with a cup of coffee. And that is where my quiet time is spent to this day. Warmth to me fosters communion and closeness and conversation. I sit by my little fireplace with my cup of coffee and picture Him there with me and invite Him to join me in my quiet time and tell me anything He wants me to know. Most days don't start until I've had my fireside chat with Jesus. My prayer time has never been so rich or so sweet. We don't hurry, Jesus and me. We take our time. Sometimes I talk first; sometimes I simply wait. It's becoming easier and easier to close my eyes and see Him sitting there beside me, coffee mug in hand.\n\nSometimes He speaks to my spirit. Sometimes we sit silently. I tell Him funny things. I tell Him serious things. I ask Him questions. Sometimes He answers. Sometimes He doesn't. Sometimes I picture us toasting our coffee mugs together in celebration when something really good happens.\n\nBut whatever we do, it's beautiful. It's beautiful and uncertain and even a little vulnerable, inviting Jesus to join me in the midst of whatever mess I've created this week. It's all about patience and childlike faith and a willingness to wait.\n\nAs are most worthwhile endeavors in life.\n\nBEAUTIFUL CERTAINTY:\n\nI'm learning God wants to speak to us, and we have to offer Him the beautiful silence to do so. When I quiet my heart and my thoughts and just draw close to Him, I begin to hear His still, small voice in my spirit. Today I urge you to stop talking and stop asking and stop begging and stop requesting and just get silent in His presence and _listen_. Who knows? His still, small voice might just blow your mind.\n\n_Prayer_\n\nGod, thank You for the sweetness of Your presence. Show me how to not just talk at You but to listen to You. Remove any distraction that would keep me from hearing Your still, small voice. \n_If an Ex Pokes You on Facebook and You Don't Respond, Did Anything Actually Happen?_\n\nEven though I hesitate to give him one more keystroke or one more dot of ink on the pages of my life, the continuing saga of Mr. E and me (my on-again/off-again ex of seven years) is a story that needs to be told. Because, you see, the story finally gets a conclusion this time.\n\nHe came back into my life on a Monday.\n\nAs you may recall, at the end of _I've Never Been to Vegas but My Luggage Has_ , I hadn't spoken to Mr. E in six months. That six months stretched into a year, and then almost another year until the final weeks of 2013, when I suddenly found myself Facebook to Facebook with Mr. E.\n\nBeing that it had been one year, ten months, and eighteen days since we had spoken a word to one another, and given his penchant for grand gestures, you're probably thinking he swept back into my life with great pomp and circumstance, right?\n\nYeah. No. It was in the form of (drumroll, please) . . .\n\nA Facebook poke.\n\nAre you kidding me?\n\nLet me take a moment to say here and now that I have never understood Facebook pokes. They are weird. They seem antiquated, like something better suited for Myspace. And they're completely arbitrary and random. What does a \"poke\" mean, exactly? That you want to talk? Then why not just send me a message? Call me crazy, but I just think there are a lot better ways to communicate than through a Facebook poke.\n\nBut I digress. Then again, this was Mr. E. He wasn't exactly known for his communication skills.\n\nWhy now? Why after almost two years was this epic character from my past choosing to reemerge into my present?\n\nAnd what was I supposed to do about it? Ignore him? Or, dare I . . . poke back?\n\nI remember asking my Twitter friends what it all meant. I actually tweeted, \"If an ex pokes you on Facebook and you don't respond, did anything actually happen?\" After much debate, the general consensus seemed to be that Facebook poking was sometimes a way for someone you hadn't spoken to in a while to reestablish communication. A safety net, in a manner of speaking. Reaching out and indicating interest in talking without putting much on the line (well, that part sounded familiar). So there it was. This was clearly Mr. E's way of letting me know he was back on the grid of my life, if I wanted him there.\n\nBut did I want him there? That was the real question. Perhaps my reaction to the poke was less confusion about what a Facebook poke meant and more about what a Facebook poke from Mr. E meant.\n\nGod had let me know me almost two years prior, after the last time I spoke with Mr. E, that I was not to contact him anymore until He freed me to do so. That I was to completely walk away and let him go and do nothing whatsoever except pray for him. That was the only action I felt freed to take on behalf of this giant question mark of a relationship.\n\nSo I did. Night after night, for almost two years, I prayed for him. From the darkness of my front steps on cold winter nights. From beneath the shade of my favorite tree at the park on warm spring days. From my table at Starbucks watching the brilliantly hued autumn leaves drift slowly to the ground on crisp fall afternoons. For two years I cried out to God on Mr. E's behalf. In the silence, in the quiet, it seemed absolutely nothing was happening on the surface to move either God _or_ Mr. E to make any sort of a bold move on behalf of our relationship. I couldn't see any sign that anything in the heavens or on the earth was being shaken. (But the beautiful thing about God is that in the middle of the uncertainty of my relationship with Mr. E, I was being drawn closer to Him.)\n\nAnd then came the infamous Facebook poke. It was so ridiculous and so hilarious and yet, at the same time, so wildly appropriate that our paths would converge again . . . on social media. (Hadn't God made really big moves in my life over the past few years via social media?)\n\nTaking that into consideration, remembering all the prayers on all the nights over the past two years of silence, and remembering the five years of history prior to that, I took a deep breath . . .\n\nAnd I poked him back.\n\nMy seven years of back and forth with Mr. E had been sometimes beautiful, mostly uncertain. (As matters of the heart often are.) Maybe he didn't deserve another chance. Or even a Facebook poke. But I knew whatever happened, God had my back.\n\n**WHEN YOU KNOW GOD IS YOUR SAFETY NET, SUDDENLY LEAPS OF FAITH DON'T LOOK SO SCARY.**\n\nBEAUTIFUL CERTAINTY:\n\nAs scary as it might be to take a chance . . . it's scarier not to. There comes a time when you have to just stop waiting for the answers and start boldly living with the questions. As for me? I pray I'm always brave enough to take the shot. Go for it. Leap without looking. And walk through fear to see what—and who—is on the other side.\n\n**IF YOU TRUST GOD AND TAKE A CHANCE, GOOD THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN OR BAD THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN. BUT IF YOU DON'T TAKE A CHANCE, NOTHING HAPPENS.**\n\n_Prayer_\n\nGod, thank You that when You are at the center of my life, I can take bold steps and chances and risks with confidence, knowing that even if things go wrong, You can find a way to turn it for my good. \n_Lessons Learned from a Homeless Man Named Louie_\n\nOne afternoon as I was pulling out of McDonald's, iced coffee in hand, I spotted a homeless man standing on the side of the road, selling newspapers. This is a familiar sight in Nashville. Although I usually try to purchase the one-dollar newspapers when I see someone selling them, I didn't have cash, so I kept going. As I pulled out into the busy intersection to head to my meeting, however, the man waved at me, a sweet, humble smile on his face. Something about that wave and smile plucked at my heartstrings. I ignored it, though, wanting to get back on the road, since I knew there were still traffic jams to navigate. As I approached the red light to make a left turn and head back to the interstate, I felt God tugging at my heart.\n\n_\"Mandy, turn around and go offer to buy that man something to eat.\"_\n\nI didn't hear the audible voice of God, but I knew in my heart what He was telling me to do.\n\nStill, I tried to ignore it. I was running more than fifteen minutes late already.\n\n\" _Mandy_.\" I felt God's insistent prodding. I continued to resist, arguing with Him in my mind.\n\n\" _God, I don't want to. I'm a single woman, alone, with no way to defend myself should he turn out to be dangerous. What if he's just a panhandler and not even really homeless? What if? What if, what if?\"_ You know, basically all the usual arguments we have with ourselves and with God to get out of confronting the problem of homelessness and poverty, and admitting maybe we can have a small hand in being the solution.\n\nAs the light turned green and I started to make the left turn that would take me back to the interstate and away from the man on the corner, something in me just couldn't turn my back on him. I swooped around in the middle of the road instead, making a U-turn and circling back around to him.\n\nI rolled down my window, and the man approached me, somewhat shyly.\n\n\"Hello!\" I greeted him. \"I don't have any cash (which was true), but can I buy you something to eat or drink?\"\n\nHe smiled. \"Well, I sure do appreciate it, young lady. I'd love something to eat.\"\n\n\"What can I get for you?\"\n\n\"Well,\" he looked a little bashful. His face was deeply tanned and lined with creases from long hours spent in the sun. He was clearly not impaired in any way, and although he was a bit rumpled and disheveled, he was dressed as nicely as one could be under his circumstances and seemed to take pride in his job selling newspapers. \"It's fifty-cent cheeseburger day at McDonald's. How about four of those?\"\n\nThe request broke my heart a little. I was offering to buy him anything he wanted to eat, and his biggest wish was four, fifty-cent cheeseburgers from McDonald's. That's all. He didn't even ask for a drink.\n\n\"Can't I get you something to wash them down with? A Coke, maybe?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, no ma'am. The burgers will do just fine.\"\n\nI assured him I'd be right back. And as I sat in the line at McDonald's, my eyes filled with tears. It would take me exactly five minutes and two dollars to make someone's day a little brighter, and I had almost passed up the opportunity to do so. Out of fear, out of doubt, out of my own selfish desires to get somewhere a little faster and avoid an inconvenience.\n\n**HOW OFTEN IN LIFE DO WE MISS OUT ON BLESSING SOMEONE BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO BE INCONVENIENCED?**\n\nWhen I got to the window, I was hit with sudden inspiration and ordered the four cheeseburgers . . . plus a large order of fries, two apple pies, and a large Coke. If I was going to be a blessing, I was going to be as big of a blessing as I could be—even if it was in the form of McDonald's. It's funny how God can use something as seemingly insignificant as a fifty-cent cheeseburger to love on one of His children.\n\nThe entire order was just seven dollars. (A fact not lost on me that my \"meal with God\" at Zaxby's a few weeks prior had been the same price.) Didn't Jesus say, \"Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me\" (Matthew 25:40 NIV)?\n\nI drove back to him and handed him the food. He took it from me gratefully. \"God bless you, young lady.\"\n\n\"Can I ask you your name?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am. It's Louie.\" He handed me one of the wrinkled newspapers he had been clutching.\n\n\"Hi, Louie. I'm Mandy. Is there anything I can pray for you about?\"\n\nHis kind, worn eyes crinkled at the sides when he smiled down at me.\n\n\"No, ma'am . . . but I'll be praying for you.\" Then he paused. \"When you can't trace God's hand, you sure can trust His heart.\" He reached down and gave me a fist bump. I laughed.\n\n\"Thank you, Louie. I hope you have a great rest of the day.\"\n\n\"God bless you, Mandy.\" He trotted away clutching the drink and the bag of McDonald's goodies as if they were gold. And I headed back into traffic, my heart full.\n\nLater I was reflecting on my encounter with this precious soul (that almost didn't happen) when God started to speak to me about several things. Things I can only hope I am able to do a good job of being a vessel and putting into words here.\n\n1. How often do we ignore God's pullings and tuggings on our hearts because the thing He's telling us to do doesn't seem safe, or convenient, or sensible? We so often go through life looking for signs, angels, and touchstones to point us in the right direction but missing our opportunities to be those things for someone else. What if we're not always supposed to be on the lookout for our guardian angels? What if that's not enough? What if we're supposed to actually _be_ those things for someone else?\n\n2. When we do miss opportunities to be a blessing to others, we also lose the blessing ourselves. And I don't say that for ego-driven or pride-driven reasons. I'm sure Louie enjoyed his three-course meal from McDonald's, but there's no way he enjoyed it even half as much as I enjoyed blessing him with it. It filled my heart with joy to fill that sweet man's belly with food, and it only cost me seven dollars. It often takes so little to bless someone so much. Why don't we do it more often?\n\n3. This is the most important lesson I took from my encounter with Louie. He was homeless, disheveled, and likely not all that clean. Who knows how frequently he gets to bathe, living on the streets? His life in pieces all around him. His next meal, and even his next steps in life, uncertain. Yet, even in the midst of all that, and actually _because_ of all that, he moved me. He captured my heart. I wanted to show him love. I wanted to do whatever I could to minister to him and bring him a little joy.\n\nSo what's my point in all this? We tend to run from God when we sin. We hide from Him when we mess up. We stand cowering in the corner of the ruins of our lives, scared to approach Him or face Him or ask Him for any kind of help because we're afraid He's mad at us. We're afraid we're too big of a mess for Him to possibly love us. We are pitifully human and entirely, and not always beautifully, uncertain. We are, in a sense, Louie.\n\nBut what if it's possible that if I, in all my fleshly, fallible, imperfect humanity, found something so sympathetic and so worthy of love in Louie, then maybe, just _maybe_ , God isn't turned off or angry or unsympathetic with us in the middle of _our_ messes? What if it is, in fact, exactly the opposite?\n\n**WHAT IF GOD SEES US STANDING THERE, HOPELESS AND HELPLESS AND ENSNARED IN THE CHAOS OF OUR OWN BAD CHOICES, AND INSTEAD OF TURNING HIS BACK ON US, IT MAKES HIM LONG TO OPEN HIS ARMS EVEN WIDER TO US?**\n\nWhat if we've been wrong about Him all along? What if He hates the sin because of what it's done to our lives but is still passionately in love with the sinner? What if He looks beyond the dirt and the muck and the filth and the garbage we've cluttered our lives with and sees only the beautiful, precious heart of His child beating underneath?\n\nOr . . .\n\nWhat if we're hanging our heads in shame, asking God for a fifty-cent cheeseburger because we don't feel like we're worthy of more than that, and all the while He longs to bless us with the burgers, the fries, the large Coke, and the apple pie?\n\nBEAUTIFUL CERTAINTY:\n\nI'm so thankful that despite what the world would have us believe, loving God isn't about being perfect or flawless or even having it all together. It's about loving God first, loving people second, and allowing God to use our imperfections, mistakes, and failures to glorify His strength, which is made perfect in our weakness (2 Corinthians 12:19). There is no one more usable to God than the imperfect person. And this is just one reason why I love Him so very much.\n\n_Prayer_\n\nGod, help me to always seek to be a blessing to others, even when it's scary or uncertain or inconvenient . . . especially then. May I never pass up an opportunity to allow Your love to shine through me. Help me learn to rest in Your grace even as I extend it to others, knowing there is nothing I can do to deserve it and also nothing I can do to cancel it out. \n_Clarity and Closure_\n\nAfter the Facebook poke between Mr. E and me, in the silence, in the moment between uncertainty and certainty when I battled between seeking clarity and seeking closure, I began to imagine what I would say to him after two years of silence.\n\nWhy was it so hard to figure out what I would say to him beyond a Facebook poke? For the same reason I tried to avoid all thoughts of Mr. E whenever possible: Because I wasn't over him. Because I still thought about him all the time. Because I had blocked his Facebook updates so they wouldn't come to my newsfeed because when and if the day came that something popped up telling me he was engaged or getting married or even just \"in a relationship,\" I wasn't sure my heart would be able to handle it.\n\nHad I put my life on hold for him? No. I lived fully and I lived big. And I tried to be as open as I possibly could to new love finding me. But at night, once I had taken off my makeup and my defenses were down and my mind started to wander, it seemed rather than new love sitting down at the table of my life to join me, old love managed to find its way back in . . . and I was back there again. Back in the middle of the moment when I last saw him, standing at a crowded train station in Queens, clinging to him for dear life, never wanting to let go . . . because I knew the moment I did, he would disappear down the street and out of my life with the same haste of a New York City taxi speeding away from the curb.\n\nIf I closed my eyes even a little, I was back in that moment, wondering what I could do or say differently to change the way the story went. To change the fact that more than two years would pass before I'd see him or talk to him, or even hear a word of any kind from him at all. I could still taste the tears and hear the sounds of the train speeding down the track. I could still smell his clean, fresh linen shirt as I rested my head on his shoulder for the last time. I could almost rewind every moment since that one and close my eyes tight enough to feel like, for a second, I was back there with him and we were still \"us,\" and there was still a chance to find and mend the errant thread of our almost-relationship before it\n", "final_result_str": "repair", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "a53ede17-d65d-4866-bf17-bead2b7639a0", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "need_repair", "evidence": "前置内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "4d24997b-95ad-4e69-8214-fba74b41af53", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "正常的小说"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "cae11aaf-8aac-4afd-bb9a-c45deadf36a5", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "书"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "551efe40-cdd3-41cc-97be-094e4fa12a6e", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 知识性内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

A beam steering generator sets the amplitude and phase of each transmit module.

Phased array radars provide a spatial degree of freedom to shape the transmitted beams. Fully focused beams can be generated for high sensitivity missions and shaped and spoiled beams can be generated for lower sensitivity missions.

Other array blockages and voids are created by the presence of auxiliary and dummy elements.\nAs a result, the transmitted Cosecant-squared antenna pattern may have high side lobes which degrade effective clutter rejection.\n\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "983f965c-f4c0-4252-92af-c0aa0d6d94fb", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "介绍雷达系统，主题明确"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "9534ec39-1e31-43a7-887b-a7bf6d01a4bc", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "1. 雷达系统的介绍\n2. 1处语法错误，比较少"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "aef39b2f-4bf9-4aa6-8fc6-5103ca72675c", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "学术内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "bfe2d63f-5f30-4585-a599-802889374b89", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 知识性内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates generally to a system to increase the communication and sensing capabilities of a surface craft. More particularly, this invention relates to sensor and communications equipments carried in a balloon tethered to a surface craft to increase line-of-sight sensing and communication.\n2. Description of the Prior Art\nLine-of-sight (LOS) communications are being used to provide secure high-speed transfers of data to-support tactical operations. Currently, only satellites are capable of supporting LOS communications and transfer of data over the considerable distances where ships, aircraft, and submarines are typically separated during anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations. However, satellite communications are expensive, limited by channel availability, require large antennas for two-way communications (found only on ships having large decks), and cannot always be as flexible as required to meet the changes that frequently, rapidly develop during ASW operations.\nAircraft that drop sonobuoys to listen for submarines must then orbit high in the sky to monitor them and receive their LOS data. The high orbiting of the aircraft prevents them from flying low where they are more likely to detect a submarine visually or though the use of radar, MAD, or FLIR which work better at low altitudes. Another factor to consider is that the number of aircraft and ships for ASW is decreasing so that each ship/aircraft is forced to cover larger areas of search. Consequently, they may miss some of the LOS data, and this potential constraint places additional stress on personnel to effectively coordinate and share the gathered data to find submarines that are becoming even quieter.\nCurrently, there is a limitation of the amount of improvement that can be obtained through improving the location or size of the antenna/sensor packages to increase detection/reception ranges. In addition, many antenna/sensor packages may have their capabilities restricted to one degree or another and may not be able to perform their functions effectively by being placed on a ship where LOS may be compromised by electromagnetic interference, and other competition from other on-board systems. Size, location, and weight of some antennas may affect the ship\"\"s stability (roll), delectability, and the amount of power that may be available to a system without impacting other systems, and some active and passive countermeasures may interfere with the operation of other shipboard systems. Loading a ship with sensors and communications packages may actually create a further problem since hostile cruise missiles may home in on these packages. Since an effective defense against cruise missiles is to draw attacking cruise missiles away from a ship, it may be better to locate the packages the missiles home onto someplace else besides on the ship.\nThus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art for a system including a balloon towed behind a moving ship that supports appropriate instrumentation packages overhead to improve line-of-sight sensing and communication capabilities.\nThe first object of the invention is to provide an improvement for surface craft, or ships to improve their line-of-sight sensing and communication capabilities.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a system including a balloon tethered to and towed by a ship to support sensors and/or communications equipment to improve their LOS (line-of-sight) capabilities.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a towed airborne array system providing improved performance of sensor and communications equipments with ships, submarines, and aircraft operating in larger areas.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a towed airborne array system improving the performance of existing sensors and communications equipments.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a system for monitoring sonobuoys from a surface ship to free ASW aircraft from orbiting and monitoring duties.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a system for monitoring sonobuoys from a surface ship and/or unmanned, autonomous buoys to free ASW aircraft from orbiting and monitoring duties.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a towed airborne array system that increases flexibility to use power and transmission bands for communications.\nStill another object of the invention is to provide a towed airborne array system that permits less reliance on satellites and provides twenty-four hour improved capabilities in line-of-sight communications and data sensing.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a towed airborne array system that increases capabilities for mine detection and countermeasures performance.\nThese and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.\nAccordingly, the present invention provides a towed airborne array system including a balloon towed behind a moving surface ship that supports appropriate instrumentation packages overhead to improve line-of-sight sensing and communications.\n\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "8a8030b9-595b-4560-9c46-94797400da86", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "1. google没搜到；\n2.

I was surrounded by all of Seth’s family and close friends, my close family, and my bridesmaids. Seth’s sister, Abbey, did an amazing job making the bridal shower so personable to me with my kitchen decor colors, and all of my favorite foods. I was so taken back at everyone’s selflessness, kind, and thoughtful gifts. We had so much fun opening up all of our wonderful gifts, then taking them back to Seth’s and looking at them all again, making a huge stack and shutting the door behind us, then Seth had to returned back to school. Someday soon we will be able to organize all of our neat gadgets into a home soon! I just cant wait to begin using all of our fun stuff and cooking for Seth!\nThank you to all of you that joined us on Sunday! We are so appreciative of your gifts and we can’t wait to celebrate with you on July 12th!\nSkip forward to this weekend…We spent our Friday night chilling on the couch dancing and picking out wedding music. I think we have some pretty unique, not heard yet at a wedding, music going on! I’m very excited to meet with our DJ in June, especially after winning ProShowDJ from South Bend, that was a huge blessing! Then today and tonight we pulled out all of our wedding decor and sat and organized it all. I really hope that everyone will look at every detail. I’m sure some will, and also some will never know the amount of time and effort that was put into each piece. But our wedding day is so important to us, and it is also important to us that it is unique and personal to us.\nWedding stuff will be on a break for the next two weeks as I prepare for vacation with my family in Destin, Florida. And also for the week that I have to work late and make up for all the time that I am missing, and of course prepare all my beautiful (& handsome) clients for this tropical vacations also! Why do we scramble the week before vacation to prepare everything, and also work your booty off at work!? Oh yeah, I guess so you will fully take advantage of your time on the beach!

Pick up your newspaper from a newsstand then pop into La Boqueria market – at its most colourful in the morning – for a proper Catalan breakfast like baby squid and poached eggs.\n\n10.30am\n\nGothic Quarter\n\nAcross La Rambla is the Gothic Quarter. Meander through its shady, narrow lanes and palm-filled courtyards. Get the background on today's Old Town at the City History Museum (MHCB) or have a coffee break in the diminutive Meson del Café on Llibreteria.\n\n12 noon\n\nBreathtaking church\n\nOver Via Laietana is the Born district. Glimpse the breathtaking interior of Santa Maria del Mar, or sip una copa de cava on the terrace of La Vinya del Senyor and admire the church facade.\n\n1.30pm\n\nLunchtime\n\nGet into the local rhythm and have a menú del dia, three courses at remarkably low rates in a neighbourhood bar like Rodrigo in Argenteria, or around the Passeig del Born.Another option is to walk 10 minutes to Barceloneta for a paella by the sea at Can Majó.\n\n3.30pm\n\nSiesta break\n\nA gentle stroll along the Passeig Marítim towards the Vila Olímpica, pausing for coffee in one of the waterfront xiringuitos (beach bars), is ideal for working off lunch. Indulge in a taxi back to base for a reviving siesta, essential to keep up the pace until the wee hours.\n\n5.30pm\n\nExplore the Eixample\n\nA session of retail therapy in the modernista setting of the Eixample is recommended for all the family.Those who don't shop can visit a Gaudí building, like La Pedrera or Casa Batlló, or just wander around the area to see a wealth of decorative details, from stained glass to ceramics, by his genius contemporaries.\n\n8.30pm\n\nDrinks and tapas\n\nRelax at one of the many terrace bars in elegant Rambla Catalunya, or try the eponymous cocktail at Dry Martini, Aribau 162.Afterwards go for tapas, the perfect dinner, especially when created by top chef Carles Abellan at Tapas 24.\n\n11.00pm\n\nOn the town\n\nRound off the day in style just up the road at designer Club Ommsession, Rosselló 265, part of award-winning Hotel Omm, where you can rub shoulders with the sleek and beautiful. Alternatively, catch a cab to Mirablau, halfway up Tibidabo hill, and dance till dawn overlooking the city.\nIntroduction\n\nSpain is located in the far southwest of Europe and comprises the largest part of the Iberian Peninsula (with Portugal claiming a narrow strip hugging most of the western coastline). The Balearic Islands of Ibiza, Mallorca and Menorca, in the western Mediterranean, also belong to Spain, as do the sub-tropical Canary Islands, off the west coast of Africa.\n\nThe El Molino windmill outside Antigua village, Fuerteventura\n\nAPA Neil Buchan Grant\n\nEvolution of Modern Spain\n\nStarting with the Phoenicians' founding of Cádiz in 1100BC, Spain was colonised over a period of some 2,500 years by such diverse cultures as the Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Visigoths and the Moors, all of whom contributed something to the character of the country. It was not until the Catholic Monarchs, Fernando (Ferdinand) and Isabel, drove the last remaining Moors from their capital in Granada in 1492 that Spain became a united country. At the same time, the previously harmonious relationship between Catholics and people of Jewish and Moorish origin was broken by the Spanish Inquisition, which persecuted the latter two groups and expelled them from the country. The same year saw the event that started Spain's Golden Age – the first modern European voyage to America led to Spain becoming fabulously wealthy from her Southern American colonies. These treasures, however, were soon squandered in pointless wars and Spain retreated, introspectively, behind the formidable barrier of the great Pyrenees mountain range.\n\nIt was a desperately poor Spain that re-emerged onto the international stage in 1936, torn asunder in a violent, murderous civil war between the left-leaning Republicans – assisted by the famed International Brigades – and the right-wing Nationalists led by General Franco, helped by German and Italian military might. After his victory in 1939, Franco instituted a harsh dictatorship that ended only with his death in 1975. He was succeeded as head of state by King Juan Carlos I who, despite having been groomed as a successor by Franco, surprised the country by immediately setting in motion a rapid and bloodless transformation of Spain into a democratic constitutional monarchy. Since then, general elections have seen the government controlled by parties of both the left and of the right. During the past two decades, more and more power has devolved to the 17 autonomous regions.\n\nWide open spaces\n\nWhile Spain is (at 504,880 sq km/194,885 sq miles) the third largest country in Europe, after Russia and France, it has a proportionately small population (just under 47 million). Consequently, and unusually in Europe, vast areas of the country remain wild, rugged and under-populated.\n\nRich Scenic Diversity\n\nImpressive mountain ranges, such as the Pyrenees and Sierra Nevada, as well as numerous lesser-known massifs, are spread throughout Spain's mainland, a large part of which is made up of the central plateau, or meseta. And, not to be outdone, the Canary Island of Tenerife has Mt Teide – the highest mountain in the country. Along Spain's Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts – and, of course, on the islands – you find almost every conceivable type of beach environment. Inland are powerful rivers, arid plateaux, wide plains and even, in Almería and on the island of Fuerteventura, desert.\n\nRegional Pride\n\nSpain's varied terrain and the assimilation of so many diverse cultures have shaped the character of its peoples. And it is, in reality, peoples in the plural. Some of the country's 17 autonomous regions are fiercely independent – both in their thinking and in their relative freedom from interference by central government, a combination that has given rise to passionate 'regional nationalism', most notably among the Catalans and Basques, but in other regions as well. This is reflected most obviously for visitors in the use of local languages rather than Castilian Spanish. In fact, only about 60 percent of Spaniards use Castilian as their first language.\n\nCostume reinforces regional identity – here in Murcia\n\nAPA Gregory Wrona\n\nDespite the regions differing widely in custom and character, they generally share a very 'Spanish' lifestyle. This includes a love of children, devotion to family and friends, and an open and inclusive social life that involves partaking of much fine food and wine. Generally, Spaniards are a garrulous, happy and contented people who place much importance on politeness, both with each other and strangers.\n\nA Wealth of Attractions\n\nThe variety of scenery and attractions in Spain promises that there will be something of interest here to the newcomer or the seasoned traveller, and everyone in between. First-time visitors may want to plan an itinerary that takes in the most important cities of historical interest that appeal to their particular interests.\n\nModernisme in Barcelona\n\nAPA Greg Gladman\n\nMadrid is the Spanish capital and transport hub, located at the geographical heart of the country, and is the most obvious place to start. Not only is it of importance in its own right, but it can also be used as a base to visit a host of fascinating nearby cities and places of interest. Barcelona, world famous for its architecture and style, should be high on everyone's list of priorities. In fact, if anything, it has more individual attractions than Madrid. Andalucía, a name that is evocative of passionate emotion, is a must, with its famous white villages and spectacular Moorish heritage in the cities of Sevilla, Córdoba and Granada.\n\nMany millions of people visit Spain each year with the aim of simply relaxing on a beach, and for this they have numerous options. The world-renowned Costas stretch from the Costa Brava at the eastern end of the Pyrenees all the way round past Gibraltar to the Costa de la Luz and the border with Portugal. Less well known is the Costa Verde (Green Coast), which is quite different in almost all respects from the other Costas, and stretches along the northern coast, passing through Cantabria, Asturias and Galicia on its way from the Basque Country. Don't forget, either, the Balearic Islands off Spain's eastern Mediterranean coast, with resorts that range from the rowdy to the refined. Visitors from the northern hemisphere in search of serious winter sunshine and swimming need look no further than the volcanic Canary Islands. Just off the coast of northwest Africa, these seven islands are as different from each other as it is possible to be.\n\nSpain also has scores of places that far fewer visitors get to see. The Basque Country, an entity unto itself, is graced by the elegant town of San Sebastián and by the stylish city of Bilbao, home to the Guggenheim Museum. Ancient Castilla y León has the fine old Castilian cities of Burgos, León, Salamanca and Segovia. Navarra is renowned for the bull-running that forms part of the San Fermín Festival in Pamplona, but also has beautiful green countryside. La Rioja is justly famous for its wines, and the old kingdom of Aragón stretches from the high Pyrenees down to its capital Zaragoza and on to Teruel. Between Madrid and Andalucía are two of the least-visited regions of Spain: Castilla-La Mancha, to the east and south, is well known for its wines and Don Quixote windmills, and the isolated city of Cuenca is famous for its Casas Colgadas (Hanging Houses). Extremadura has always been remote, but that didn't stop the Romans from making Mérida one of its major towns. Cáceres, also founded by the Romans, is important for its collection of 16th-century palaces.\n\nCala Figuera, Mallorca\n\nAPA Greg Gladman\nA Brief History\n\nSpain's history is as rugged and colourful as the land itself. It is a tale of Roman and Moorish domination and a glorious Golden Age; of empires and colonies conquered and defeated; of brave knights and foolish kings; and of a bloody and destructive civil war that saw Spain cut off from the international community for some four decades of the 20th century. Since Franco's death in 1975, Spain's transformation into a modern European state has been nothing short of spectacular.\n\nEarly Influences\n\nThe earliest inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula were Paleolithic people who probably arrived via a land bridge linking Europe and Africa between Gibraltar and Morocco. As the Ice Age gripped Europe, the first Iberians put on bearskin coats, stoked up their fires, and fed off deer, bison and wild horses – just like those depicted on the walls and ceilings of caves discovered in Cantabria, near Altamira, which date back at least 15,000 years.\n\nDuring the Bronze Age, Celtic migrants settled in northern and central Spain, while the south and east were inhabited by various Iberian tribes of North African origin. The Iberians had their own written language, sophisticated industry and tools, and they created fine works of art, such as the stone sculpture of a female deity, known as La Dama de Elche (The Lady of Elche), a star attraction at Madrid's Archaeological Museum. The Celts and the Iberians interacted where their territories overlapped and developed a distinct Celtiberian culture. The Celtiberians soon gained fame as warriors and it is said that they invented the two-edged sword, later to become standard equipment in the Roman army, and to be used against their inventors.\n\nBefore this, Phoenicians, sailing from bases in North Africa, founded several colonies in southern Spain. The first of these, established in about 1100BC, was Gadir (present-day Cádiz). Carthage, which was itself a Phoenician colony, established an empire of its own that spread as far north into Spain as Barcelona and the island of Mallorca. The Carthaginians exploited Spain's silver and lead mines and drafted the country's young, able-bodied males into their army. Barcelona was the base from which Carthaginian forces under Hannibal set out to defeat Rome in the 3rd century BC, nearly succeeding in their objective before being defeated by the Romans in the Second Punic War. The defeat of the Carthaginians left the way open for Rome to take control of the peninsula, though it took nearly 200 years to subjugate the stubbornly resistant Celtiberians.\n\nSpain Under the Caesars\n\nSecond only to the homeland itself, Spain was to become the most important part of the Roman Empire. In many parts of the country the stamp of Roman civilisation remains: in roads and bridges, walls and vineyards, as well as in the ruins of aqueducts and amphitheatres, palaces and villas. Three living Spanish languages are descended from Latin: Gallego (Galician), Castilian (Spanish) and Catalan. Roman law forms the foundation of the Spanish legal system, and Spain gave birth to Roman emperors as memorable as Trajan and Hadrian, as well as the writers Seneca and Martial.\n\nThe Romans initially divided the peninsula into two: Hispaniae Ulterior and Hispaniae Citerior ('Farther' and 'Nearer' respectively). When later, under Augustus, it was carved into three provinces, the capital cities were established at what are now Mérida (in Extremadura), Córdoba (Andalucía) and Tarragona (Catalonia). Christianity came to Spain early in the Roman period. The word may have been carried by St Paul himself – he is said to have preached both in Aragón and at Tarragona.\n\nThe Visigoths\n\nOverstretched and increasingly corrupt, Rome watched its far-flung colonies disintegrate, and Germanic tribes, some with a deserved reputation for barbarism, hastened into the vacuum. The Vandals had little to contribute to Spanish culture. However, the Gaulish Visigoths from France did bring a certain constructive influence. Former allies of Rome, they ruled from Toledo, where they displayed their intricate arts and built opulent churches.\n\nThe 300-year regime of the Visigoths never achieved any measure of national unity, and eventually foundered on the thorny question of succession. They had introduced to Spain the commendably democratic principle of elective monarchy, but this fostered a web of intrigue and assassination as contenders attempted to secure the crown. These, as well as other problems, were often blamed on the handiest scapegoat: the industrious and successful Jews. They had fared well under the Romans and early Visigoths, but at the start of the 7th century, all non-Christians were forced either to convert to Christianity or face exile.\n\nEnter the Moors\n\nDuring AD711, an expeditionary force of around 12,000 Berber troops from North Africa sailed across the Straits of Gibraltar and poured ashore into Spain. Their expertly planned invasion was led by General Tariq ibn Ziyad (the name Gibraltar is a corruption of Gibel Tariq – Tariq's Rock). His ambition was to spread the influence of Islam.\n\nWithin just three years, the Moors had reached the Pyrenees. Their initial success was assisted by ordinary citizens attracted by promises of lower taxes and by serfs offered the chance of freedom. Spanish Jews welcomed the Moors as liberators because, initially at least, the occupation forces stipulated religious tolerance. However, conversion to Islam was later forcefully encouraged, and many Christians chose to embrace the Muslim creed.\n\nFusion of Moorish and Christian elements at the monastery of San Juan de Duero, Soria\n\nConor Caffrey\n\nThe most tangible relics of the Moorish era in Spain are today among the country's greatest tourist attractions: the exquisite palaces, gardens and mosques of Córdoba, Granada and Sevilla. Thanks to the advanced irrigation techniques imported from North Africa, crops such as rice, cotton and sugar were planted, and lush orchards of almonds, pomegranates, oranges and peaches thrived. Other Moorish innovations made possible the production of paper and glass.\n\nArtistic legacy\n\nThe art of medieval Moorish artisans is preserved in today's best Spanish craft buys – ceramics, tooled leather and intricate silverwork.\n\nThe Christians Strike Back\n\nThe Moorish juggernaut that trundled north from Gibraltar in 711 met no serious resistance. It was 11 years before the fragmented defenders of Christian Spain won their first battle. Exiled to the northern territory of Asturias, the Visigothic nobles, led by Pelayo, joined with local mountain folk to strike the first blow in the long-drawn-out Reconquest of Spain. Further Christian victories would be a very long time coming, but Pelayo's success in 722 at the Battle of Covadonga (the village is now a shrine) sparked off the desire to defeat the Moors and gave heart to a struggle that was to simmer for centuries.\n\nIn the middle of the 8th century, the Christians of Asturias, under King Alfonso I, took advantage of a rebellion by Berber troops to occupy neighbouring Galicia. Here, at Santiago de Compostela, the alleged discovery of the tomb of the apostle St James (Santiago) was to make Compostela the religious focus for Spanish Christians and a rallying point for knightly defenders of the Christian faith throughout Europe. More breathing space from Moorish pressure was won in what we now know as Catalonia. Charlemagne, King of the Franks, captured Catalonia's capital, Barcelona, and established a buffer zone here between Islamic Spain and France. Spanish Christians then seized the advantage and expanded south and west into the area between Catalonia and Asturias, which soon had so many frontier castles that it became known as Castile.\n\nThe Reconquest see-sawed on for hundreds of years, as each side gained and lost territorial advantage under a succession of leaders. Over the centuries, squabbles among the Moors resulted in alliances of convenience with the Christians, and the intermingling of the two cultures was commonplace. Christians who thrived in the Moorish regions were known as Mozarabes, and their Moorish counterparts – Muslim inhabitants of Christian enclaves – were known as Mudéjars. These two names are now attached to the two most important art styles of this period, which are a blend of both Christian and Moorish elements.\n\nBanys Arabs (Arab Baths) in Palma de Mallorca\n\nAPA Greg Gladman\n\nEarly in the 10th century, the Asturian capital was transferred approximately 120km (75 miles) south from Oviedo to León, a symbolic step deep into former 'infidel' territory. However the Muslims were far from on the run. United under the dictator al-Mansur ('the victorious'), they reclaimed León, Barcelona and Burgos and, in a severe blow to Christian morale, sacked the town of Santiago de Compostela. The death of the charismatic al-Mansur in 1002 revived Christian hopes. In 1010, they succeeded in recapturing al-Mansur's headquarters of Córdoba, and the city of Toledo fell in 1085.\n\nStatue of El Cid in Burgos\n\nAPA Chris Coe\n\nThe fall of Toledo sent out shock waves to Moorish rulers elsewhere in Spain and they called for help from the Almoravids, a North African confederation of Muslim Berber tribes based in Marrakesh. Known for their military prowess, they halted the Reconquest, but in the 12th century sent for further reinforcements from the Almohad fundamentalists, who stepped up the persecution of Jews and Mozarabes. The turning point of the Reconquest is held to be the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212. In its wake, the Christian forces regained most of Spain south to Andalucía, to the point where the final Moorish stronghold at Granada was recaptured in 1492.\n\nA Singular Nation\n\nUp until the 15th century, the various regional kingdoms of Spain remained resolutely independent. There were some sporadic moves towards unity, which usually involved strategic marriage contracts, and it was one such royal marriage that united the shrewd Fernando of Aragón and strongly religious and patriotic Isabel of Castile. Under the reign of the Catholic Monarchs, as Pope Alexander VI entitled them, a single Spain was created, comprising most of the nation we know today, though the component parts of the newly united kingdom retained their individuality and their institutions.\n\nEl Cid\n\nThe legend of El Cid, Spain's national folk hero, is recounted in the epic poem El Cantar de Mío Cid. Born Rodrigo Díaz deVivar in around 1040 near Burgos, he was a highly successful soldier of fortune.Vivar at first fought for the kings of Castile in the battle against the Moors. When Sancho II died in mysterious circumstances,Vivar humiliated his successor, Alfonso VI, by forcing him to swear publicly that he had nothing to do with Sancho's death. Exiled for his impudence,Vivar joined the Moors, from whom he received his honorary title, El Cid (Arabic for 'Lord'). El Cid's greatest victory was in 1094, when he led a Christian-Moorish army to take Valencia, where he died in 1099. Encouraged by his death, a Moorish army regrouped to take the city. El Cid's body was propped on his horse and ridden before the defending army, which routed the attackers.\n\nAiming to further unite the country, Fernando and Isabel inaugurated the Inquisition in 1478. Initially intended to safeguard religious orthodoxy under Isabel's influential confessor, the fanatical Tomás de Torquemada, it became a byword for the persecution of Jews, Muslims and, later, Protestants. Several thousand suspected heretics were horribly tortured and many were publicly burned at autos da fé (show trials). In 1492, Torquemada convinced Fernando and Isabel to expel the surviving unconverted Jews – perhaps 200,000 in all, including some of the country's best-educated and most productive citizens.\n\nThe year 1492 was a momentous one for Spanish history. Not only did it witness the expulsion of the Moors and the Jews, but also Europe's discovery of the New World by Genoese explorer Cristobal Colón (Christopher Columbus). Sponsored by Queen Isabel (who, according to legend, pawned her own jewels to raise the money), the expedition and subsequent annexation of the New World territories laid the foundations for Spain's Golden Age.\n\nThe Habsburgs\n\nWhile Fernando and Isabel were Spain personified, their grandson and heir to the throne, Carlos I, born in Flanders in 1500, could barely compose a sentence in Spanish. Through his father, Philip, Duke of Burgundy, he inherited extensive possessions in the Low Countries; he was appointed Holy Roman Emperor (Charles V) in 1519. An unpopular king, Carlos alienated his Spanish subjects by appointing Flemish and Burgundian supporters in key posts such as Archbishop of Toledo and regent during his frequent absences. Carlos's expansionist foreign policies consolidated Burgundy and the Netherlands as Spanish provinces. He also annexed Milan and Naples and drew Spain into a series of costly European wars funded from the seemingly bottomless pit of Spain's New World bounty.\n\nIn 1556, overwhelmed by his responsibilities, Carlos abdicated in favour of his son, Felipe II. Born and educated in Spain, the new king gave top jobs to Castilians and proclaimed Madrid his capital, thereby converting an unimpressive town of 15,000 into the powerhouse of the greatest empire of the age. As literature and the arts flourished, Felipe worked endlessly to administer his over-extended territories. He captured Portugal, and shared in the glory following the destruction of the Turkish fleet at Lepanto (1571). However, the destruction of the Spanish fleet in the disastrous Armada episode (1588) and the spiralling cost of maintaining the empire eventually robbed Felipe of his health and severely depleted the Spanish treasury. He died in devout seclusion at El Escorial, the palace-monastery in the hills northwest of Madrid.\n\nMadrid's elegant Retiro Park, transformed from a former Habsburg hunting ground by Spain's Bourbon rulers\n\nConor Caffrey\n\nAlthough Spain was still the dominant force in Europe at Felipe's death, the Golden Age and empire were on the wane. Felipe III delegated his responsibilities to his favourites, involved Spain in the Thirty Years' War between the Catholic and the Protestant parts of Europe, and expelled the remaining Moriscos (Moorish converts to Christianity after the Reconquest), many of them farmers, thereby precipitating an agricultural crisis.\n\nThe final century of the Habsburg era saw a gradual, then a rapid decline in Spanish fortunes. Ironically, in contrast to the severe loss of territorial possessions and despite the ravages of war, pestilence and famine, the works of Velázquez, Zurbarán, Murillo and Ribera bear witness to the achievements of Spanish artists of the age.\n\nThe last of the Spanish Habsburgs, Carlos II, died heirless in 1700. His crown went to the Duke of Anjou, grandson of Louis XIV of France, who claimed the title as Felipe V of Spain. Archduke Charles of Austria (another Habsburg) contested the claim, which sparked the War of the Spanish Succession, ended by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713.\n\nBourbons on the Throne\n\nFelipe V eventually secured the throne, but his diminishing empire was now shorn of Belgium, Luxembourg, Milan, Sicily and Sardinia. To add insult to injury, Britain snatched strategic Gibraltar. The most successful Spanish king of the 18th century, Carlos III, recruited capable administrators, disbanded the Inquisition, invigorated the economy and paved the streets of Madrid. But Spain came increasingly under the power of France during the Bourbon period.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Franco-Spanish fleet by the British at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, Carlos IV had to abdicate. Napoleon tried to appoint his brother Joseph as José I, but the Spanish rose against the French, resulting in the Peninsular War (known in Spain as the War of Independence). In 1814, with the help of British troops led by the Duke of Wellington, the French were finally ousted. While all this was going on, a number of Spain's most profitable American colonies took advantage of her preoccupation to secure their independence.\n\nWith Fernando VII on the throne, a Bourbon king once again ruled Spain, but the country miserably failed to prosper. Political infighting, a repressive monarchy and anti-clerical revolts led to the domestic Carlist Wars. The 19th century ended with another disaster as Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines were lost in the Spanish-American War.\n\nThe Spanish Civil War\n\nItalian planes bomb the Republicans in the Civil War\n\nAPA Glyn Genin\n\nSpain escaped the horrors of World War I, watching the carnage from a position of neutrality. Alfonso XIII backed the dictatorship of General Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923–30), but went into exile (never to return) after anti-royalist forces won a landslide victory in the 1931 elections. The new Republic was riven with bitter ideological conflicts, between the Left and Right. A left-wing victory in the 1936 elections and the assassination of the Monarchist leader, Calvo Sotelo, ignited nationalist and conservative fears of a Marxist revolution. Monarchists, clergy and the right-wing Falange organisation united behind the Movimiento Nacional, led by General Francisco Franco. Meanwhile, a coalition of liberals, communists, socialists and anarchists cast their lot with the newly elected Spanish government.\n\nThe outcome was the Civil War: three years of horrific bloodshed and destruction which gutted towns and cities and claimed between 50,000 and 75,000 lives, as father fought son and region battled against region. Franco emerged victorious, but the country was shattered, both physically and emotionally.\n\nThe New Spain\n\nFranco ruled the country for almost 40 years, a period of political repression accompanied from the 1960s onwards by economic development. On Franco's death in 1975 his chosen successor, Juan Carlos de Borbón, grandson of Alfonso XIII, was crowned king. He oversaw an extraordinarily swift and smooth transition from dictatorship to democracy. A new constitution was approved that devolved many powers to 17 newly created 'autonomous' regions.\n\nThe Socialist party held power for much of the 1980s and 1990s. During this time Spain rejoined the mainstream of international life, becoming a member of Nato and the EU. In the momentous year of 1992 a World Fair was held in Seville and the Olympic Games in Barcelona. A right-of-centre government succeeded the Socialists but was ousted from power in 2004 following the traumatic terrorist bombing of Madrid commuter trains. In 2007 Spain was hit by the credit crisis, which badly affected its important construction industry, and has forced a rethink of economic priorities.\nHistorical Landmarks\n\nc.3000BC Bronze-Age Celts in the north, Iberians in the south.\n\n1100BC Phoenicians found Gadir (Cádiz).\n\n3rd century BC Carthaginians conquer much of Spain.\n\n1st century BC Romans complete their conquest of Spain.\n\n1st century AD Christianity introduced.\n\n4th century Decline of the Roman Empire.\n\n6th century Visigoths make Toledo their capital.\n\n711 Moors take Andalucía and control most of Spain.\n\n722 Christian Reconquest begins at Covadonga.\n\n758 Córdoba becomes the Moorish capital.\n\n1469 Marriage of Fernando (Ferdinand) of Aragón and Isabel of Castile paves the way for Spain's unification.\n\n1478 Inauguration of the Inquisition.\n\n1492 Fall of Granada,the last Moorish stronghold,to the Christians completes the Reconquest.

Under Mohammed I, the Moors fortified the town in 865, and made it a walled city. Just over two centuries later, in 1083, Madrid was reconquered by King Alfonso VI. Fernando IV summoned the Courts of the Kingdom in 1309, the Catholic Monarchs ordered the de-fortification of the city's walls and gates in 1476 and, in 1561, Felipe II moved the court here from Toledo, making Madrid the capital of a vast empire.\n\nThe early part of the next century, during the Habsburg era, saw the addition of the Plaza Mayor. The House of Bourbon succeeded the Habsburgs, and it was this dynasty that was responsible for many of the grand buildings and monuments that adorn the city today. Among these are the Royal Palace, completed in 1764; the Alcalá gate, raised in 1778 to honour Carlos III's entry into the city as king, and the Prado Museum constructed between 1785 and 1819. During the Spanish Civil War, the city was subject to a siege by the Nationalist forces, whose eventual entry into Madrid effectively ended hostilities.\n\nMadrid is the largest city in Spain and, at an elevation of 655m (2,100ft), the highest capital in Europe. The ambiance of this hustling, bustling modern city reflects an intriguing blend of old and new. It also makes a good base for exploring several nearby historic cities. The best way to get around town is by the cheap and efficient metro (underground) system.\n\nThere is much to see, and the best place to start is the bustling Plaza Puerta del Sol (Gate of the Sun), the hub of 10 converging streets. This is literally the crossroads of Spain, known as 'Kilometre 0' in the country's highway system, and home to an imposing equestrian statue of Carlos III and a smaller statue depicting Madrid's coat-of-arms – a bear standing against a madroño (arbutus, or strawberry) tree.\n\nSitting out on the vast Plaza Mayor\n\nAPA Glyn Genin\n\nPlaza Mayor\n\nA few blocks west is the Plaza Mayor A [map] (Main Square), a 17th-century architectural masterpiece. Its broad arcades surround a vast, traffic-free, cobbled rectangle, once used as the innercity showground for bullfights, pageants and even public executions. Today, an equestrian statue of Felipe III surveys rows of outdoor cafés and lively summer-season festivals. The plaza's most famous houses are the Casa de la Panadería (Bakers' Guild), which holds some of the city archives, and the Casa de la Carnicería (Butchers' Guild), whose facades are decorated with a series of vibrant, and even mildly erotic, paintings.\n\nContinuing west on Calle Mayor, Plaza de la Villa juxtaposes stately 16th- and 17th-century buildings of differing styles. These include the lovely Casa de Cisneros, which belongs to the ornate and delicate style of architecture known as Plateresque (platero means silversmith), and the towering Habsburg-era Ayuntamiento (City Hall).\n\nPalacio Real\n\nTo the north is the Palacio Real B [map] (Royal Palace; Apr–Sept Mon–Sat 9am–6pm, Sun and holidays 9am–3pm, Oct–Mar Mon–Sat 9.30am–5pm, Sun and holidays 9am–2pm; charge; closed on state occasions), set among formal gardens on a bluff overlooking the Manzanares Valley. Felipe V commissioned this imposing French-style palace on the site of the old Moorish fort, and furnished its 2,000 rooms (more than any other European palace except the Hermitage in St Petersburg) in a suitably regal fashion. It was the principal residence of Spanish kings from Felipe's time in the mid-18th century until Alfonso XIII was exiled in 1931. Visit at your leisure, or join one of the hour-long tours that take in around 50 rooms, including the overwhelmingly rococo Gasparini Room, the Ceremonial Dining Room with seating for 145 guests, and the Throne Room with its stunning Tiepolo ceiling frescoes. Also worth seeing are the Royal Armoury, the Pharmacy and the Library.\n\nGuards at the Palacio Real\n\nAPA Glyn Genin\n\nThe Gran Vía C [map] is Madrid's main thoroughfare. Lined with shops, hotels, restaurants, theatres, cafés and nightclubs, it cuts a wide path west to east from Plaza de España to the busy round Plaza de la Cibeles, so named for the Cybele Fountain that is adorned with a sculpture of a Greek fertility goddess.\n\nDiego de Acedo (1644), by Velázquez, Museo del Prado\n\nConor Caffrey\n\nArt Collections\n\nArt lovers are spoilt for choice in Madrid. One of the city's fascinating hidden treasures is the Monasterio de las Descalzas Reales (Tue–Thur and Sat 10.30am–12.45pm and 4–5.45pm, Fri 10.30am–12.45pm, Sun and holidays 11am–1.45pm; charge; guided tours), located behind the El Corte Ingles store at the Puerta del Sol. Once a retreat for the Kings of Castile, this 16th-century convent has been handsomely endowed with a wealth of art treasures. The Real Academía de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, also close to the Puerta del Sol, has a fine collection of paintings by Goya (mid-June–Sept Tue–Fri 9am–5pm, Sat 9am–3pm, Sun 9am–2.30pm, rest of the year Tue–Sat 9am–5pm, Sun until 2.30pm; charge, free on Wed except holidays).\n\nHoused in 18th-century neoclassical grandeur, the Museo del Prado D [map] (Tue–Sun 9am–8pm; charge, free Sun), with its fabulous art treasures amassed by the Spanish monarchy, is not to be missed. The Prado houses the world's greatest collection of Spanish paintings, and a particularly strong set of Italian and Flemish masterpieces. If time is short, plan ahead and decide what you most want to see. Likely top-of-the-list sights are works by El Greco (1541–1614), Ribera (1591–1652), Zurbarán (1598–1664), Felipe IV's court painter Velázquez (1599–1660, whose Las Meninas, or Maids of Honour, is said to be Spain's favourite painting), Murillo (1617–82), and magnificent Goya (1746–1828). Of the Dutch and Flemish masters, be sure not to miss works by Hieronymous Bosch (known as 'El Bosco') and Rubens. The Italian Old Masters include works by Raphael, Titian and Tintoretto.\n\nThe big three\n\nArt lovers intent on seeing Madrid's Big Three art museums – the Prado, Thyssen-Bornemisza, and the Reina Sofía – would do well to acquire the Paseo del Arte voucher. This allows visits to all three museums for a single price (around €18), a considerable saving on the individual admission prices. It's vaild for a year.\n\nAcross the Plaza Cánovas del Castillo, the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza (Tue–Sun 10am–7pm; charge) spans 700 years of artistic endeavour from the Italian primitives to Pop Art. Just a short distance to the south the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía (Mon–Sat 10am–9pm, Sun 10am–2.30pm; charge, free on Sat after 2.30pm and on Sun am) has important collections of modern art and many masterpieces by Picasso – including his monumental mural, Guernica, inspired by the Civil War bombing of a Basque village.\n\nThe impressive Museo Arqueológico (Tue–Sat 9.30am–8pm, Sun 9.30am–3pm; charge, free Sat after 2.30pm and Sun, partially open while refurbishment work is undertaken) contains the celebrated Celtiberian bust known as La Dama de Elche and a wealth of Visigothic treasures discovered at Toledo. In the gardens is a replica of the prehistoric Altamira caves, complete with wall paintings.\n\nIf the sightseeing and the bustle get too much, the enormous Parque del Retiro behind the Prado is a favourite spot for Madrileño s out for a stroll. Originally a 17th-century Habsburg hunting ground, it offers 121 hectares (300 acres) of leafy avenues, flower beds and park benches, as well as a rose garden, boating lake and Sunday morning sideshows. There are also cafés, exhibitions in the Palacio de Cristal and Palacio de Velázquez and, across the road, a botanical garden founded by Carlos III in 1781.\n\nAround Madrid\n\nAranjuez\n\nOne of the most popular day-trips from Madrid is to the royal town of Aranjuez 2 [map], 48km (30 miles) south by train or motorway. The best way to get here in summer is from Atocha station on board the Tren de la Fresa, a steam train running along Spain's second-oldest railway line built in 1849. The main reason to make the journey is to stroll in the pleasant formal gardens, laid out for the leisure of the court, which nudge up to the banks of the Río Tajo (River Tagus). It is not hard to see how they could have been the inspiration for Spain's most famous piece of music, Joaquín Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez.\n\nNot to be missed is the Palacio Real, a royal palace which stands at the heart of Aranjuez. It took shape over 200 years, evolving through the reigns of eight monarchs, but in its present form it is mostly the work of 18th-century baroque inspiration. The guided tour leads visitors through a succession of ornate rooms including the throne room, king's smoking room and porcelain room. From outside the palace two bridges lead over a narrow branch of the river to the Jardin de la Isla (Island Garden), which combines Spanish, Flemish and Moorish influences in its classical fountains and clipped hedges.\n\nToledo is almost surrounded by the River Tagus\n\nAPA Glyn Genin\n\nToledo\n\nLocated on a strategic hill protected by the encircling River Tagus, Toledo 3 [map] is a fascinating historical city and a Unesco World Heritage Site. Conquered by the Romans in 193BC, Toledo became the political and religious capital of the Visigoths in the 5th century AD after they had overrun the Vandals. After the Moors invaded Spain, in AD711, the city was incorporated into the Córdoba Emirate. When the Emirate disintegrated in 1012, it became the capital of an independent kingdom. In 1085 Alfonso VI of León reconquered Toledo and made it his capital, a status it retained until 1561 when Felipe II moved the capital to Madrid. This marked the beginning of the decline of the importance of Toledo, even though it has remained the seat of the Primate of Spain.\n\nUnquestionably the most important monument in the city is the massive cathedral (Mon–Sat 10am–6.30pm, Sun 2–6.30pm; charge). The first one on this site was built jointly by the Visigoth King Recaredo I and the first Bishop of Toledo, San Eugenio. Converted into a mosque by the Moors, it was not until 1227 that King Fernando III, 'the Saint', began construction of the present building. It was not completed until the 16th century and as it incorporates numerous architectural styles it is known as the 'Museum Cathedral'. The coro or choir (closed Sun morning) and main altar reredos are marvels of woodcarving. Just behind the main chapel, Narciso Tomé's baroque Transparente is an 18th-century masterpiece, and in the Sala Capitular (Chapter House) there is an intricate ceiling in the Mudéjar style. If you look up you'll see hats hanging precariously from the vaulting. They are suspended over plaques that indicate tombs of Primates buried below; each hat belonging to the respective Primate.\n\nToledo Steel\n\nToledo is famous all over the world for the quality of its steel, and swords have been forged here since Roman times.According to legend, the special property of the steel is inherited from the magical water of the RiverTagus (RíoTajo). Look for damascene steel souvenirs.This is a craft unique to the city, which involves inlaying black steel with decorative gold, copper and silver filigree.\n\nDon't miss, either, the Tesoro (Treasury) with religious artworks, including 18 paintings by El Greco, and Enrique de Arfe's Monstrance. Made of solid silver and gold, it has more than 5,600 parts and weighs a substantial 200kg (430lb).\n\nDominating the city is the enormous Alcázar (Oct–May Tue–Sat 9am–7pm, Sun 10am–3pm, June–Sept Tue–Sat 10am–9pm, Sun 10am–3pm), a fortress destroyed and rebuilt many times since the Roman era. The latest destruction occurred during the Civil War and the fortress houses an Army Museum with displays relating to the dramatic 72-day siege.\n\nEl Greco in Toledo\n\nThe painter El Greco is inextricably linked with Toledo. His first commission was to paint the reredos at the Cistercian convent of Santo Domingo el Antiguo which, founded in 1085 by King Alfonso VI, is the oldest monastery in Toledo (11am–1.30pm and 4–7pm, closed Sun am; charge). More famously, his Burial of the Count of Orgaz, a fascinating depiction of local noblemen attending the count's funeral, is on display at the church of Santo Tomé (daily 10am–7pm, winter until 6pm; charge) – also notable for its landmark Mudéjar tower. The young boy attending upon the saints is considered to be a likeness of El Greco's son, and on a handkerchief dangling from the boy's pocket he signed his name, Doménico Theotokopouli, and the date, 1583. More of El Greco's work, including a Crucifixion with Toledo as the backdrop, can be found at the 16th-century Museo-Hospital de Santa Cruz (Mon–Sat 10am–6.30pm, Sun 10am–2pm; free).\n\nExhibit in the Army Museum\n\nAPA Glyn Genin\n\nJust downhill from Santo Tomé is a restored 14th-century building El Greco lived in for a number of years. It now forms the Casa-Museo de El Greco (closed for refurbishment), and brings together some of El Greco's work, as well as pieces by Murillo.\n\nNearby is La Sinagoga del Tránsito built by Samuel Levi, a 14th-century financier and a friend of King Pedro I of Castile. Muslim artists adorned the walls with intricate filigree and Hebrew inscriptions from the Psalms. The synagogue houses the Museo Sefardí (Sephardic Museum; mid- Feb–early Dec Tue–Sat 10am–9pm, Sun 10am–2pm, early Dec–mid-Feb Tue–Sat 10am–6pm; charge). Not far away is the Santa Maria la Blanca synagogue, which resembles a mosque and has a simplicity of style that enhances its ambiance.\n\nJust down the street is a fine church with royal connections.

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of die cast thin-walled details of metal and a device in a mold adapted thereto.\n2. Description of Known Technology\nDie cast metal parts are commonly used today. These are used in many different areas where there are high demands for low weight, function and precision. Details obtained through ingot casting need to be extensively processed after casting to achieve the desired precision. Such details also need fairly thick goods to ensure complete filling of the mold cavity since no pressure can be applied. The latter increases the weight of finished work piece weight which is not desirable. Also inner volumes of articles intended to have a certain capacity is reduced. Injection molding of for example aluminum makes it possible to utilize so called rheo-casting which provides higher homogeneity and reduced risk of forming pores in the molded goods. Injection molding of aluminum is performed in the temperature range 670-720° C. High pressures are used to produce thin-walled parts in particular when utilizing rheo-casting. This implies that high demands on the sealing planes in the mold as the melt has low viscosity and easily creeps into the partition plan. Traditionally, it has therefore been considered impossible to design injection molded details with collapsing core as this would greatly reduce the life expectancy of the mold.\nOne way known in the art is to utilize separate cores for providing undercuts. These separate cores are assembled into the mold prior to molding and is after the molding pried or knocked out of the molded part. There are several problems with this known method.\nFirst of all, the molded part will shrink onto the separate core and the release angle will therefore have to be rather large, typically in excess of 5°. This will of course limit the practical use of making undercuts.\nSecondly the cycle time will increase as the mold will have to be assembled before each molding.\nThirdly the separate cores will be damaged due to all the handling especially when the separate cores are knocked out of the molded part. This will affect the sealing of the mold and consequently limit the useful life of the mold itself.\nFourth, the mold temperature is very important for the quality of the molded detail and there is no practical way to temper the separate cores prior to, as well as during the molding cycle.\nFifth, the use of separate cores will also increase the need for post molding treatment as the inevitable dents on sensitive edges of the separate cores, which are intended to form sealing planes in the mold will cause so called burrs and flash.\nSixth, the knocking and prying operation to remove the separate cores from the molded part will increase the risk for damaging not only the separate core but also the part itself. Small cracks or fissures not unlike those related to as metal fatigue can occur which leads to a need for substantial testing of molded parts with serious functions such as certain critical vehicle components.\nSeventh, the separate cores need to be fixed in their proper position during the molding which calls for one or more support pins arranged at the opposite side of the mold. These support pins will leave holes in the molded part and these holes will in most cases have to be plugged after molding.\nEight, all of the above listed problems will inevitably lead to a substantial cost increase for the molded articles due to increased handling, longer cycle times, shorter life expectancy of the molds, increased amount of rejected articles, lower average quality of molded parts, increased testing to assure quality and finally increased work effort on each molded part.\n\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "39471726-74bf-4204-bc5a-7362713f55fe", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "通顺的发明专利"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "4ab33579-83b5-4d8a-bbc5-59abcb712be6", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "专利"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "3b93286d-5e08-4e98-9516-9b11e6322a71", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "1. 语法错误23\n2 发明专利"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "10bdddd2-1496-47a0-8695-7b77afd9ac1e", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 知识性内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

In these the writer attempted to give as\nvivid and exact an idea of the sights and scenes which he witnessed as\ncould be conveyed to those who had never visited Europe.\n\nWhether describing Westminster Abbey, or York Minster,\nStratford-on-Avon, or the streets of London; the wonders of the Louvre,\nor the gayeties and glitter of Paris; the grandeur of the Alpine passes;\nthe quaintness of old continental cities; experiences of post\ntravelling; the romantic beauties of the Italian lakes; the underground\nwonders of Adelsberg, or the aqueous highways of Venice,--the author\naimed to give many minute particulars, which foreign letter-writers deem\nof too little importance to mention, but which, nevertheless, are of\ngreat interest to the reader.\n\nThat the effort was, in some measure, successful, has been evinced by a\ndemand for the sketches in permanent form, sufficient to warrant the\npublication of this volume.\n\nIn so presenting them, it is with the belief that it may be pleasant to\nthose who have visited the same scenes to revisit them in fancy with the\nwriter, and with a hope that the volume may, in some degree, serve as a\nguide to those who intend to go \"over the ocean,\" as well as an\nagreeable entertainment to the stay-at-homes.\n\n      C.

What a realm of\nenchantment to us, story-book readers, was beyond the great blue ocean!\nand how we resolved, when we grew to be a man, we would travel all over\nthe world, and see every thing, and buy ever so many curious things in\nthe countries where they grew or were made. Even that compound which\nproduced \"the finest jet black ever beheld,\" was to us invested with a\nsort of poetic interest in boyhood's day, for the very stone jug that we\nheld in our hand had come from London,--\"97 High Holborn,\"--and there\nwas the picture of the palatial-looking factory on the pink label.\n\nLONDON! There was something sonorous in the sound, and something solid\nin the very appearance of the word when written. When we were a man,\ndidn't we mean to go to London!\n\nYears added to youth dissipated many of these air-built castles, and\nother barriers besides the watery plain intervene between the goal of\none's wishes, and Europe looks further away than ever. \"Going to Europe!\nEverybody goes to Europe nowadays,\" says a friend. True, and in these\ndays of steam it is not so much of an event as formerly; indeed, one\nwould judge so from many of his countrymen that he meets abroad, who\nmake him blush to think how they misrepresent Americans.\n\nThe Great Expositions at London and Paris drew from our shores every\nAmerican who could by any manner of means or excuse leave business, and\nobtain funds sufficient to get over and back, if only for a six weeks'\nvisit. The Exposition brought out to Paris and to Europe, among the\nswarm of Americans who went over, many such, and some who had scarcely\nvisited beyond the confines of their native cities before crossing the\nAtlantic. These people, by their utter inexperience as travellers, and\nby their application of the precept inculcated in their minds that money\nwould answer for brains, was a substitute for experience, and the only\npassport that would be required anywhere and for anything, became a\nsource of mortification to their countrymen, easy game for swindling\nlandlords and sharp shop-keepers, and rendered all the great routes of\ntravel more beset with extortions and annoyances than ever before.\n\nBut about \"going to Europe.\" When one decides to start on a pleasure\ntrip to that country for the first time, how many very simple things he\nwishes to know, that correspondents and people who write for the papers\nhave never said anything about. After having once or twice gone over in\na steamship, it never seems to occur to these writers that anybody else\nwill want to become acquainted with the little minutiae of information\nrespecting life on board ship during the trip, and which most people do\nnot like to say they know nothing about; and novices, therefore, have to\nclumsily learn by experience, and sometimes at four times the usual\ncost.\n\nSpeaking of cost, let me say that this is a matter upon which hardly any\ntwo tourists will agree. How much does it cost to go to Europe? Of\ncourse the cost is varied by the style of living and the thoroughness\nwith which one sees sights; by thoroughness I mean, besides expenditure\nof time, the use of extra shillings \"_pour boires_,\" and the skilful\ndispensation of extra funds, which will gain admission to many a\nforbidden shrine, insure many an unexpected comfort, and shorten many a\nweary journey.\n\nThere is one popular error which one quickly becomes disabused of, and\nthat is, that everything abroad is dirt cheap, and it costs a mere song\nto live. Good articles always bring good prices. Many may be cheaper\nthan at home, it is true, but they are by no means thrown away, and good\nliving in Paris cannot be had, as some suppose, for three francs a day.\n\nIf one is going abroad for pleasure, and has a taste for travelling, let\nhim first decide what countries he wishes to visit, the routes and time\nhe will take, and then from experienced tourists ascertain about what it\nwould cost; after having learned this, add twenty per cent. to that\namount, and he will be safe.\n\nSafe in the knowledge that you have enough; safe in being able to make\nmany little purchases that you will never dream of till you reach Regent\nStreet, the Boulevards, the \"Piazza San Marco,\" the Florence mosaic\nstores, or the Naples coral shops. Safe in making little side excursions\nto noted places that you will find on your route, and safe from the\nannoying reflection that you might have done so much better, and seen so\nmuch more, if you had not limited the expenditure to that very amount\nwhich your friend said would take you through.\n\nThese remarks of course apply only to those who feel that they can\nafford but a fixed sum for the journey, and who ought always to wait\ntill they can allow a little margin to the fixed sum, the more\ncompletely to enjoy the trip.\n\nI have seen Americans in French restaurants actually calculating up the\nprice of a dinner, and figuring out the price of exchange, to see if\nthey should order a franc's worth more or less. We may judge how much\nsuch men's enjoyment is abridged.\n\nOn the other hand, the class that I refer to, who imagine that money\nwill pass for everything, increase the cost of travel to all, by their\npaying without abatement the demands of landlords and shopkeepers. The\nlatter class, on the continent, are so accustomed, as a matter of\ncourse, to being \"beaten down\" in the price, that it has now come to be\na saying among them, that he who pays what is at first demanded must be\na fool or an American. In Paris, during the Exposition, green Englishmen\nand freshly-arrived Americans were swindled without mercy. The jewelry\nshops of the Rue de la Paix, the Grand Hotel, the shops of the Palais\nRoyal, and the very Boulevard cafes fleeced men unmercifully. The\nentrance of an American into a French store was always the occasion of\nadding from twenty to twenty-five per cent. to the regular price of the\ngoods. It was a rich harvest to the cringing crew, who, with smirks,\nshrugs, bows, and _pardonnez moi's_ in the oiliest tones, swindled and\ncheated without mercy, and then, over their half franc's worth of black\ncoffee at the restaurant, or glass of absinthe, compared notes with each\nother, and boasted, not how much trade they had secured or business they\nhad done, but how much beyond the legitimate price they had got from the\nforeign purchaser, whom they laughed at.\n\nAll the guide-books and many tourists exclaim against baggage, and urge\nthe travelling with a single small trunk, or, as they call it in\nEngland, portmanteau. This is very well for a bachelor, travelling\nentirely alone, and who expects to go into no company, and will save\nmuch time and expense at railway stations; but there is some comfort in\nhaving wardrobe enough and some space for small purchases, even if a\nlittle extra has to be paid. It is the price of convenience in one\nrespect, although the continual weighing of and charging for baggage is\nannoying to an American, who is unused to that sort of thing; and one\nvery curious circumstance is discovered in this weighing, no two scales\non the continent give the same weight of the same luggage.\n\nPassage tickets from America to Europe it is, of course, always best to\nsecure some time in advance, and a previous visit to the steamer may aid\nthe fresh tourist in getting a state-room near the centre of the ship,\nnear the cabin stairs, and one having a dead-light, all of which are\ndesirable things.\n\nHave some old clothes to wear on the voyage; remember it is cold\nat sea even in summer; and carry, besides your overcoat and warm\nunder-clothing, some shawls and railway rugs, the latter to lie round on\ndeck with when you are seasick.\n\nThere is no cure for seasickness; keep on deck, and take as much\nexercise as possible; hot drinks, and a hot water bottle at the feet are\nreliefs.\n\nPeople's appetites come to them, after seasickness, for the most\nunaccountable things, and as soon as the patient 'hankers' for anything,\nby all means let him get it, if it is to be had on board; for it is a\nsure sign of returning vigor, and in nine cases out of ten, is the very\nthing that will bring the sufferer relief. I have known a delicate young\nlady, who had been unable to eat anything but gruel for three days,\nsuddenly have an intense longing for corned beef and cabbage, and, after\neating heartily of it, attend her meals regularly the remainder of the\nvoyage. Some make no effort to get well from port to port, and live in\ntheir state-rooms on the various little messes they imagine may relieve\nthem, and which are promptly brought either by the stewardess or bedroom\nsteward of the section of state-rooms they occupy.\n\nThe tickets on the Cunard line express, or did express, that the amount\nreceived includes \"stewards' fees;\" but any one who wants to be well\nserved on the trip will find that a sovereign to the table steward, and\none to the bedroom steward,--the first paid the last day before reaching\nport, and the second by instalments of half to commence with, and half\njust before leaving,--will have a marvellously good effect, and that it\nis, in fact, an expected fee. If it is your first voyage, and you expect\nto be sick, speak to the state-room steward, who has charge of the room\nyou occupy, or the stewardess, if you have a lady with you; tell him you\nshall probably need his attention, and he must look out for you; hand\nhim half a sovereign and your card, with the number of your room, and\nyou will have occasion to experience most satisfactorily the value of\nBritish gold before the voyage is over. If a _desirable_ seat at the\ntable is required in the dining-saloon--that is, an outside or end seat,\nwhere one can get out and in easily,--or at the table at which the\ncaptain sometimes presides, a similar interview with the saloon steward,\na day or two before sailing, may accomplish it.\n\nBesides these stewards, there are others, who are known as deck\nstewards, who wait upon seasick passengers, who lie about the decks in\nvarious nooks, in pleasant weather, and who have their meals brought to\nthem by these attentive fellows from the cabin table. It is one phase of\nseasickness that some of the sufferers get well enough to lie languidly\nabout in the fresh, bracing air, and can eat certain viands they may\nfancy for the nonce, but upon entering the enclosed saloon, are at once,\nfrom the confined air or the more perceptible motion of the ship,\nafflicted with a most irrepressible and disagreeable nausea.\n\nWell, the ticket for Liverpool is bought, your letter of credit\nprepared, and you are all ready for your first trip across the water.\nPeople that you know, who have been often, ask, in a _nonchalant_ style,\nwhat \"boat\" you are going \"over\" in; you thought it was a steamer, and\nthe easy style with which they talk of running over for a few weeks, or\nshould have gone this month, if they hadn't been so busy, or they shall\nprobably see you in Vienna, or Rome, or St. Petersburg, causes you to\nthink that this, to you, tremendous undertaking of a first voyage over\nthe Atlantic is to be but an insignificant excursion, after all, and\nthat the entire romance of the affair and the realizing of your\nimagination is to be dissolved like one of youth's castles in the air.\nSo it seems as you ride down to the steamer, get on board, pushing amid\nthe crowds of passengers and leave-taking friends; and not until a last,\nand perhaps, tearful leave-taking, and when the vessel fairly swings out\ninto the stream, and you respond to the fluttering signal of dear ones\non shore, till rapid receding renders face and form indistinguishable,\ndo you realize that you are fairly launched on the great ocean, and\nfriends and home are left behind, as they never have been before.\n\nOne's first experience upon the great, awful Ocean is never to be\nforgotten. My esteem for that great navigator, Christopher Columbus, has\nrisen one hundred per cent. since I have crossed it, to think of the\namount of courage, strength of mind, and faith it must have required to\nsustain him in his venturesome voyage in the frail and imperfect crafts\nwhich those of his day must have been.\n\nTwo days out, and the great broad sweep of the Atlantic makes its\ninfluence felt upon all who are in any degree susceptible. To the\nlandsman, the steamship seems to have a regular gigantic see-saw motion,\nvery much like that of the toy ships that used to rise and fall on mimic\nwaves, moved by clock-work, on clocks that used to be displayed in the\nstore windows of jewellers and fancy dealers. Now the bows rise with a\ngrand sweep,--now they sink again as the vessel plunges into an\nadvancing wave,--up and down, up and down, and forging ahead to the\nnever-ceasing, tremulous jar of the machinery. In the calmest weather\nthere is always one vast swell, and when wind or storm prevails, it is\nboth grand and terrible.\n\nThe great, vast ocean is something so much beyond anything I ever\nimagined,--the same vast expanse of dark-blue rolling waves as far as\nthe eye can reach,--day after day, day after day,--the great ship a mere\nspeck, an atom in the vast circle of water,--water everywhere. The very\nwind sounds differently than on land; a cheerful breeze is like the\nbreath of a giant, and a playful wave will send a dozen hogsheads of\nwater over the lofty bulwarks.\n\nBut in a stiff breeze, when a great wave strikes like an iron avalanche\nagainst the ship, she seems to pause and shudder, as it were, beneath\nthe blow; then, gathering strength from the unceasing throb of the\nmighty power within, urges her way bravely on, while far as the eye can\nreach, as the ship sinks in the watery valleys, you see the great black\ntossing waves, all crested with spray and foam, like a huge squadron of\nwhite-plumed giant cavalry. The spray sometimes flies high over the\nsmoke-stack, and a dash of saline drops, coming fiercely into the face,\nfeels like a handful of pebbles. A look around on the vast expanse, and\nthe ship which at the pier seemed so huge, so strong, so unyielding,\nbecomes an atom in comparison,--is tossed, like a mere feather, upon old\nOcean's bosom; and one realizes how little is between him and eternity.\nThere seem to be no places that to my mind bring man so sensibly into\nthe presence of Almighty God as in the midst of the ocean during a\nstorm, or amid the grand and lofty peaks of the Alps; all other feelings\nare swallowed up in the mute acknowledgment of God's majesty and man's\ninsignificance.\n\nIf ever twelve days seem long to a man, it is during his first voyage\nacross the Atlantic; and the real beauty of green grass is best\nappreciated by seeing it on the shores of Queenstown as the steamer\nsails into Cork harbor.\n\nLand again! How well we all are! A sea voyage,--it is nothing. Every one\nwho is going ashore here is in the bustle of preparation.\n\nWe agree to meet A and party in London; we will call on B in\nParis,--yes, we shall come across C in Switzerland. How glib we are\ntalking of the old country! for here it is,--no three thousand miles of\nocean to cross now. A clear, bright Sunday morning, and we are going\nashore in the little tug which we can see fuming down the harbor to meet\nus.\n\nWe part with companions with a feeling of regret. Seated on the deck of\nthe little tug, the steamer again looms up, huge and gigantic, and we\nwonder that the ocean could have so tossed her about. But the bell\nrings, the ropes are cast off, the tug steams away, our late companions\ngive us three parting cheers, and we respond as the distance rapidly\nwidens between us.\n\nCustom-house officials examine your luggage on the tug. American\ntourists have but very little trouble, and the investigation is slight;\ncigars and fire-arms not forming a prominent feature in your luggage,\nbut little, if any, inconvenience may be anticipated.\n\nThis ordeal of the custom-house constitutes one of the most terrible\nbugbears of the inexperienced traveller. It is the common opinion that\nan inspection of your baggage means a general and reckless overhauling\nof the personal property in your trunks--a disclosure of the secrets of\nthe toilet, perhaps of the meagreness of your wardrobe, and a laying of\nprofane hands on things held especially sacred. Ladies naturally dread\nthis experience, and gentlemen, too, who have been foolish enough to\nstow away some little articles that custom-house regulations have placed\nunder the ban. But the examination is really a very trifling affair; it\nis conducted courteously and rapidly, and the traveller laughs to\nhimself about his unfounded apprehensions.\n\nThe tug is at the wharf; the very earth has a pleasant smell; let us get\non _terra firma_. Now, then, a landsman finds out, after his first\nvoyage, what \"sea legs\" on and sea legs off, that he has read of so much\nin books, mean.\n\nHe cannot get used to the steadiness of the ground, or rather, get at\nonce rid of the unsteadiness of the ship. I found myself reeling from\nside to side on the sidewalk, and on entering the Queen's Hotel, holding\non to a desk with one hand, to steady myself, while I wrote with the\nother. The rolling motion of the ship, to which you have become\naccustomed, is once more perceptible; and I knew one friend, who did not\nhave a sick day on board ship, who was taken landsick two hours after\nstepping on shore, and had as thorough a casting up of accounts for an\nhour as any of us experienced on the steamer at sea. The Cunard steamers\ngenerally arrive at, or used to arrive at, Queenstown on Sunday\nmornings, and all who land are eager to get breakfast ashore. We tried\nthe Queen's Hotel, where we got a very fair breakfast, and were charged\nsix or eight shillings for the privilege of the ladies sitting in a room\ntill the meal was ready for us--the first, and I think the only,\npositive swindle I experienced in Ireland. After breakfast the first\nride on an English (or rather Irish) railway train took us to Cork. The\nroad was through a lovely country, and, although it was the first of\nMay, green with verdure as with us in June--no harsh New England east\nwinds; and one can easily see in this country how May-day came to be\ncelebrated with May-queens, dances, and May-poles.\n\nTo us, just landed from the close steamer, how grateful was the\nfragrance of the fresh earth, the newly-blossomed trees, and the hedges\nall alive with twittering sparrows! The country roads were smooth, hard,\nand clear as a ball-room floor; the greensward, fresh and bright, rolled\nup in luxuriant waves to the very foot of the great brown-trunked trees;\nchapel bells were tolling, and we saw the Irish peasantry trudging along\nto church, for all the world as though they had just stepped out of the\npictures in the story-books. There were the women with blue-gray cloaks,\nwith hoods at the back, and broad white caps, men in short corduroys,\nbrogues, bobtail coats, caubeens and shillalah; then there was an\noccasional little tip-cart of the costermonger and his wife, drawn by a\ndonkey; the jaunting-car, with half a dozen merry occupants, all forming\nthe moving figures in the rich landscape of living green in herbage, and\nthe soft brown of the half moss-covered stone walls, or the corrugated\nstems of the great trees.\n\nWe were on shore again; once more upon a footing that did not slide from\nbeneath the very step, and the never-ending broad expanse of heaving\nblue was exchanged for the more grateful scene of pleasant fields and\nwaving trees; the sufferings of a first voyage had already begun to live\nin remembrance only as a hideous nightmare.\n\nA good hotel at Cork is the Imperial Hotel; the attendance prompt, the\nchamber linen fresh and clean, the viands well prepared.\n\nThe scenery around Cork is very beautiful, especially on the eastern\nside, on what is known as the upper and lower Glanmere roads, which\ncommand fine views. The principal promenade is a fine raised avenue, or\nwalk, over a mile in length, extending through the meadows midway\nbetween two branches of the River Lee, and shaded by a double row of\nlofty and flourishing elms.\n\nOur first walk in Ireland was from the Imperial Hotel to the Mardyke.\nFifteen minutes brought us to the River Lee; and now, with the city\nproper behind us, did we enjoy the lovely scene spread out to view.\n\nIn the month of May one realizes why Ireland is called the Emerald\nIsle--such lovely green turf, thick, luxurious, and velvety to the\ntread, and so lively a green; fancy New England grass varnished and\npolished, and you have it. The shade trees were all in full leaf, the\nfruit trees in full flower; sheep and lambs gamboling upon the\ngreensward, birds piping in the hedges, and _such_ hedges, and\nlaburnums, and clambering ivy, and hawthorn, the air perfumed with\nblossoms, the blue sky in the background pierced by the turrets of an\nold edifice surrounded by tall trees, round which wheeled circles of\ncawing rooks; the little cottages we passed, half shrouded in beautiful\nclambering Irish ivy, that was peopled by the nests of the brisk little\nsparrows, filling the air with their twitterings; the soft spring\nbreeze, and the beautiful reach of landscape--all seemed a realization\nof some of those scenes that poets write of, and which we sometimes\nfancy owe their existence to the luxuriance of imagination.\n\nReturning, we passed through another portion of the city, which gave us\na somewhat different view; it was nearly a mile of Irish cabins. Of\ncourse one prominent feature was dirt, and we witnessed Pat in all his\nnational glory. A newly-arrived American cannot help noticing the\ndeference paid to caste and position; we, who treat Irish servants and\nlaborers so well as we do, are surprised to see how much better _they_\ntreat their employers in Ireland, and how little kind treatment the\nworking class receive from those immediately above them.\n\nThe civil and deferential Pat who steps aside for a well-dressed couple\nto pass, and touches his hat, in Cork, is vastly different from the\nindependent, voting Pat that elbows you off the sidewalk, or puffs his\nfragrant pipe into your very face in America. In Ireland he accepts a\nshilling with gratitude, and invocation of blessings on the donor; in\nAmerica he condescends to receive two dollars a day! A fellow-passenger\nremarked that in the old country they were a race of Touch-hats, in the\nnew one of Go to ----. I found them here obliging and civil, ready to\nearn an honest penny, and grateful for it, and much more inclined to\n\"blarney\" a little extra from the traveller than to swindle it out of\nhim.\n\nI made an arrangement with a lively driver to take us to the celebrated\nBlarney Castle in a jaunting-car--a delightful vehicle to ride in of a\npleasant spring day, as it was on that of our excursion. The cars for\nthese rides are hung on springs, are nicely cushioned, and the four\npassengers sit back to back, facing to the side; and there being no\ncover or top to the vehicle, there is every opportunity of seeing the\npassing landscape.\n\nNo American who has been interested in the beautiful descriptions of\nEnglish and Irish scenery by the British poets can realize their\ntruthfulness until he looks upon it, the characteristics of the scenery,\nand the very climate, are so different from our own. The ride to Blarney\nCastle is a delightfully romantic one, of about six miles; the road,\nwhich is smooth, hard, and kept in excellent order, winds upon a side\nhill of the River Lee, which you see continually flashing in and out in\nits course through the valley below; every inch of ground appears to be\nbeautifully cultivated. The road is lined with old brown stone walls,\nclad with ivy of every variety--dark-green, polished leaf, Irish ivy,\nsmall leaf, heart leaf, broad leaf, and lance leaf, such as we see\ncultivated in pots and green-houses at home, was here flourishing in\nwild luxuriance.\n\nThe climate here is so moist that every rock and stone fence is clad\nwith some kind of verdure; the whole seems to satisfy the eye. The old\ntrees are circled round and round in the ivy clasp; the hedges are in\ntheir light-green livery of spring; there are long reaches of pretty\nrustic lanes, with fresh green turf underneath grand old trees, and\nthere are whole banks of violets and primroses--yes, whole banks of such\npretty, yellow primroses as we preserve singly in pots at home.\n\nThere are grand entrances to avenues leading up to stately estates,\npretty ivy-clad cottages, peasants' miserable, thatched cabins, great\nsweeps of green meadow, and the fields and woods are perfectly musical\nwith singing birds, so unlike America: there are linnets, that pipe\nbeautifully; finches, thrushes, and others, that fill the air with their\nwarblings; skylarks, that rise in regular circles high into the air,\nsinging beautifully, till lost to vision; rooks, that caw solemnly, and\ngather in conclaves on trees and roofs. Nature seems trying to cover the\npoverty and squalor that disfigures the land with a mantle of her own\nluxuriance and beauty.\n\nBlarney Castle is a good specimen of an old ruin of that description for\nthe newly-arrived tourist to visit, as it will come up to his\nexpectation in many respects, in appearance, as to what he imagined a\nruined castle to be, from books and pictures. It is a fine old building,\nclad inside and out with ivy, situated near a river of the same name,\nand on a high limestone rock; it was built in the year 1300. In the\nreign of Elizabeth it was the strongest fortress in Munster, and at\ndifferent periods has withstood regular sieges; it was demolished, all\nbut the central tower, in the year 1646.\n\nThe celebrated Blarney Stone is about two feet below the summit of the\ntower, and held in its place by iron stanchions; and as one is obliged\nto lie at full length, and stretch over the verge of the parapet, having\na friend to hold upon your lower limbs, for fear an accidental slip or\ngiddiness may send you a hundred feet below, it may be imagined that the\nact of kissing the Blarney Stone is not without its perils. However,\nthat duty performed, and a charming view enjoyed of the rich undulating\ncountry from the summit, and inspection made of some of the odd little\nturret chambers of the tower, and loopholes for archery, we descended,\ngratified the old woman who acts as key-bearer by crossing her palm with\nsilver, strolled amid the beautiful groves of Blarney for a brief\nperiod, and finally rattled off again in our jaunting-cars over the\nromantic road.\n\nThe Shelborne House, Dublin, is a hotel after the American style, a good\nFifth Avenue sort of affair, clean, and well kept, and opposite a\nbeautiful park (Stephens Green). Americans will find this to be a house\nthat will suit their tastes and desires as well, if not better, than any\nother in Dublin. Sackville Street, in Dublin, is said to be one of the\nfinest streets in Europe. I cannot agree with the guide-books in this\nopinion, although, standing on Carlisle Bridge, and looking down this\nbroad avenue, with the Nelson Monument, one hundred and ten feet in\nheight, in the centre, and its stately stores on each side, it certainly\nhas a very fine appearance. Here I first visited shops on the other side\nof the water, and the very first thing that strikes an American is the\npromptness with which he is served, the civility with which he is\ntreated, the immense assortment and variety of goods, and the effort of\nthe salesmen to do everything to accommodate the purchaser. They seem to\nsay, by their actions, \"We are put here to attend to buyers' wants; to\nserve them, to wait upon them, to make the goods and the establishment\nattractive; to sell goods, and we want to sell goods.\" On the other\nhand, in our own country the style and manner of the clerks is too often\nthat of \"I'm just as good, and a little better, than you--buy, if you\nwant, or leave--we don't care whether we sell or not--it's a\ncondescension to inform you of our prices; don't expect any attention.\"\n\nThe variety of goods in the foreign shops is marvellous to an American;\none pattern or color not suiting, dozens of others are shown, or\nanything will be made at a few hours' notice.\n\nHere in Dublin are the great Irish poplin manufactures; and in these\ndays of high prices, hardly any American lady leaves Dublin without a\ndress pattern, at least, of this elegant material, which can be\nobtained in the original packages of the \"Original Jacobs\" of the trade,\nRichard Atkinson, in College Green, whose front store is a gallery of\nmedals and appointments, as poplin manufacturer to members of royal\nfamilies for years and years. The ladies of my party were crazy with\ndelight over the exquisite hues, the splendid quality, the low\nprices--forgetting, dear creatures, the difference of exchange, and the\nthen existing premium on gold, and sixty per cent. duty that had to be\nadded to the rate before the goods were paid for in America.\nNotwithstanding the stock, the hue to match the pattern a lady had in\nher pocket was not to be had.\n\n\"We can make you a dress, if you can wait, madam,\" said the polite\nshopman, \"of exactly the same color as your sample.\"\n\n\"How long will it take to make it?\"\n\n\"We can deliver it to you in eight or ten days.\"\n\n\"O, I shall be in London then,\" said the lady.\n\n\"That makes no difference, madam. We will deliver it to you anywhere in\nLondon, carriage free.\"\n\nAnd so, indeed, it was delivered. The order was left, sent to the\nfactory by the shopman, and at the appointed time delivered in London,\nthe lady paying on delivery the same rate as charged for similar quality\nof goods at the store in Dublin, and having the enviable satisfaction of\nshowing the double poplin that was \"made expressly to her order\"--one\ndress pattern--\"in Dublin.\"\n\nI mention this transaction to show what pains are taken to suit the\npurchaser, and how any one can get what he wants abroad, if he has the\nmeans to pay.\n\nThis is owing chiefly to the different way of doing business, and also\nto the sharper competition in the old countries. For instance, the\nPacific Mills, of Lawrence, Mass., would never think of opening a retail\nstore for the sale of their goods on Washington Street, Boston; and if\nan English lady failed to find a piece of goods of the color that suited\nher, of manufacturing sixteen or eighteen yards to her order, and then\nsending it, free of express charge, to New York.\n\nThe quantity and variety of goods on hand are overwhelming; the prices,\nin comparison with ours, so very low that I wanted to buy a ship-load.\nWhole stores are devoted to specialities--the beautiful Irish linen in\nevery variety, Irish bog-wood carving in every conceivable form,\nbracelets, rings, figures, necklaces, breast-pins, &c. I visited one\nlarge establishment, where every species of dry goods, fancy goods,\nhaberdashery, and, I think, everything except eatables, were sold. Three\nhundred and fifty salesmen were employed, the proprietors boarding and\nlodging a large number of them on the premises.\n\nThe shops in Dublin are very fine, the prices lower than in London, and\nthe attendance excellent.\n\n\"But Dublin--are you going to describe Dublin?\"\n\nNot much, dear reader. Describing cities would only be copying the\nguide-book, or doing what every newspaper correspondent thinks it\nnecessary to do. Now, if I can think of a few unconsidered trifles,\nwhich correspondents do not write about, but which tourists, on their\nfirst visit, always wish information about, I shall think it doing a\nservice to present them in these sketches.\n\nThe Nelson Monument, a Doric column of one hundred and ten feet high,\nupon which is a statue eleven feet high of the hero of the Nile, always\nattracts the attention of visitors. The great bridges over the Liffey,\nand the quays, are splendid pieces of workmanship, and worth inspection,\nand of course you will go to see Dublin Castle.\n\nThis castle was originally built by order of King John, about the year\n1215. But little of it remains now, however, except what is known as the\nWardrobe Tower, all the present structure having been built since the\nseventeenth century. Passing in through the great castle court-yard, a\nring at a side door brought a courteous English housekeeper, who showed\nus through the state apartments. Among the most noteworthy of these was\nthe presence-chamber, in which is a richly-carved and ornamental throne,\nfrescoed ceilings, richly-upholstered furniture, &c., the whole most\nstrikingly reminding one of those scenes at the theatre, where the\n\"duke and attendants,\" or the \"king and courtiers,\" come on. It is here\nthe lord lieutenant holds his receptions, and where individuals are\n\"presented\" to him as the representative of royalty. The great ball-room\nis magnificent. It is eighty-two feet long, and forty-one wide, and\nthirty-eight in height, the ceiling being decorated with beautiful\npaintings. One represents George III., supported by Liberty and Justice,\nanother the Conversion of the Irish by St. Patrick, and the third, a\nvery spirited one, Henry II. receiving the Submission of the Native\nIrish Chiefs. Henry II. held his first court in Dublin in 1172.\n\nThe Chapel Royal, immediately adjoining, is a fine Gothic edifice, with\na most beautiful interior, the ceiling elegantly carved, and a beautiful\nstained-glass window, with a representation of Christ before Pilate,\nfigures of the Evangelists, &c. Here, carved and displayed, are the\ncoats-of-arms of the different lord lieutenants from the year 1172 to\nthe present time. The throne of the lord lieutenant in one gallery, and\nthat for the archbishop opposite, are conspicuous. This edifice was\ncompleted in 1814, and cost forty-two thousand pounds. It was the first\nChurch of England interior I had seen over the ocean, and its richness\nand beauty were impressive at the time, but were almost bleached from\nmemory by the grander temples visited a few weeks after. The polite\nhousekeeper, whom, in my inexperience, I felt almost ashamed to hand a\nshilling to, took it, nevertheless, very gratefully, and in a manner\nthat proved that her pride was not at all wounded by the action.\n\nIn obedience to the advice of an Emeralder, that we must not \"lave\nDublin widout seein' St. Patrick's Church,\" we walked down to that\ncelebrated cathedral. The square which surrounds it is as much a\ncuriosity in its way as the cathedral itself. The whole neighborhood\nseemed to consist of the dirtiest, quaintest tumble-down old houses in\nDublin, and swarmed with women and children.\n\nHundreds of these houses seemed to be devoted to the sale of old junk,\nsixth-hand clothing, and fourth-hand articles of every description\none could name or think of--old tin pots and kettles, old rope,\nblacking-jugs, old bottles, old boots, shoes, and clothing in every\nstyle of dilapidation--till you could scarcely say where the article\nended being sold as a coat, and became rags--iron hoops, old furniture,\nnails, old hats, bonnets, cracked and half-broken crockery. It verily\nseemed as if this place was the rag fair and ash-heap of the whole\ncivilized world. The contents of six American ash-barrels would have\ngiven any one of these Cheap John stores a stock that would have dazzled\nthe neighborhood with its magnificence.\n\nYou could go shopping here with two-pence. Costermongers' carts, with\ntheir donkeys attached, stood at the curbstones, ragged and half-starved\nchildren played in the gutters, great coarse women stood lazily talking\nwith each other, or were crouched over a heap of merchandise, smoking\nshort pipes, and waiting or chaffering with purchasers. Little filthy\nshops on every hand dealt out Ireland's curse at two-pence a dram, and\n\"Gin,\" \"Choice Spirits Sold Here,\" \"Whiskey,\" \"Spirits,\" were signs that\ngreeted the eye on their doorposts. The spring breeze was tainted with\nfoul odors, and there was a busy clatter of tongues from the seething\nand crowded mass of humanity that surged round in every direction.\n\nUpon the farther corner of the third side of the square, where the\nneighborhood was somewhat better, we discovered the residence of the\nsexton who had charge of the church--a strong Orangeman, bitterly\nopposed to the Romish church, and with a strong liking for America,\nincreased by the fact of having a brother in the American Union army,\nwho rose from sergeant to colonel in one of the western regiments.\n\n\"Think o' that, sir! Ye might be as brave as Julyus Sayzer in the\nEnglish army, and sorra a rise would ye get, except ye'd be sated on a\npowdher magazine whin it exploded.\"\n\nThe legend is, that this church was originally built by St. Patrick,\nand the sexton took me into a little old crypt at the end of one of the\naisles of the nave--all that remains of that portion of the church,\nwhich it is averred was built A. D. 540. This crypt was floored with\ncurious old tiles, over a thousand years old, put down and the fragments\nmatched together with great labor and expense, and the flooring worth\nmore money than a covering of an \"aven layer o' guineas\" upon it.\n\nThe old stone font, A. D. 1190, the old carved chest for vestments,\nand the curious stone coffins, relics of the old church, were\ninteresting. Among the monuments in the church, Archbishop Whately's\nmagnificently-carved marble sarcophagus, surmounted by his full-length\neffigy, was particularly noticeable; Swift's monument, Stella's tablet,\nand the economical tablet put up in memory of Duke Schomberg by Swift.\n\nHere in St. Patrick's Cathedral are displayed the stalls, arms, and\nbanners of the Knights of St. Patrick, the army \"memorials\" of the India\nand China British regiments, with the flags they carried from 1852 to\n1857 in their campaigns.

INTRODUCTION My concern in this paper is the relationship between faith and rationality. I seek to develop a unified account of statements of faith concerning mundane matters and those concerning religious faith. To do so, I consider the sense in which faith requires going beyond the evidence, and argue that faith requires terminating the search for further evidence. Having established this, I turn to the question of whether it can still be rational to have faith; arguing that, contrary to common assumptions, there need be no conflict between faith and rationality. We shall see that whether faith can be practically rational depends both on whether there are extrinsic costs associated with postponing the decision to have faith and the extent to which potential counter evidence would be conclusive. II. PRELIMINARIES I begin with the idea that faith statements in religious contexts and in more mundane contexts express the same attitude and so share some typical characteristics. By 'faith statements' I simply mean statements involving the term 'faith'. The following are representative examples: I have faith in your abilities. He has faith that his spouse won't cheat on him. I have faith in you. He has faith that you won't reveal his secret. She acted on faith. She has faith that her car will start. It was an act of faith. I have faith that God exists. I have faith in God's goodness. I have faith in God. 1 Forthcoming in Philosophy of Religion: An Anthology, 7th edition, eds. Louis P. Pojman and Michael Rea, Wadsworth. Reprinted from L. Buchak (2012) 'Can it be Rational to Have Faith?', Chapter 12 of Probability in the Philosophy of Religion, Oxford University Press, 225-247. Discussion has been edited to simplify and make accessible the primary mathematical results. 2 These statements share three important features: they involve a relationship between the agent and a particular proposition, between the agent and a particular (actual or potential) action, and between the proposition and the evidence the agent currently possesses. The first thing to notice is that faith statements typically involve a proposition to which the actor involved acquiesces. This is obvious in the case of 'faith that' statements: when a person has faith that p, he acquiesces to p.2 It is also clear in the case of those statements that can be easily translated into 'faith that' statements: for example, the statement I have faith in your abilities is equivalent to I have faith that you will be able to do such-andsuch. It is less obvious in the case of those statements claiming that an individual has faith in a person; however, upon further inspection, having faith in a person does typically require acquiescing to particular propositions about that person. For example, having faith in a person might involve acquiescing to the claim that the person will do the right thing or will succeed at a task, and having faith in God might involve acquiescing to (at least) the claims that God exists and that God is good. By the same token, performing an act of faith or acting on faith seems to involve acquiescing to a proposition, and which proposition one acquiesces to will be set by the context. For example, if setting down one's own weapons is an act of faith, then this is because setting down one's own weapons involves acquiescing to the claim that the other person will then set down his. The second thing to notice about faith statements is that the truth or falsity of the proposition(s) involved is ordinarily a matter of importance to the actor. For example, it does not seem apt to state that I have faith that the Nile is the longest river in Egypt, because I do not care whether or not this is true. We do not attribute faith to a person unless the truth or falsity of the proposition involved makes a difference to that person. I might consider whether to have faith that my spouse won't cheat on me or that my car will start precisely because it makes a difference to me whether or not these things are true. Along the same lines, having faith typically involves an action: a person's having faith in something should make a difference to her behaviour. However, this needn't be an 2 I speak of acquiescing to a proposition rather than believing it because I am not sure that if I have faith in something, I thereby believe it. While it sounds infelicitous to say 'I believe that ~X but I have faith that X', there may not be anything wrong with saying 'I don't know whether X-I have no idea whether I believe that X or not-but I have faith that X'. So as not to prejudge that issue, I make a weaker claim: that having faith involves taking the proposition to be true, that is, 'going along with it', but not necessarily adopting an attitude we might describe as belief. 3 actual action. It would be enough for faith that if a person were put in a particular situation, she would then manifest the relevant behaviour (assuming that there are no forces that would stop her). Faith is thus linked to a disposition to act. This brings us to the next point about the relationship between faith and behaviour: it seems that one can have faith in a particular proposition relative to one action but not to another. For example, I might have faith that my car will start when I only need to drive to work but lack that faith when I am relied upon to carry a life-saving organ to the hospital (as evidenced by the fact that I may double-check my engine or arrange for a backup mode of transportation in the latter case but not the former). A person might have faith in God when it comes to giving weekly donations to the poor but lack faith in God when it comes to allowing himself to be martyred. There are two ways in which we might interpret the fact that one might have faith when it comes to the performance of some actions but not others: we might say that faith is context-dependent, or we might say that faith comes in degrees. There is something to be said in favour of each of these approaches. However, whether one has faith that X, expressed by a particular act A, will be determinate on either approach, and since this will be our basic unit of analysis in this paper, we needn't choose between them. The next thing to bring into the picture is the relationship between the agent who has faith that X (expressed by some act A) and the evidence he has for X. We make assertions of faith only when the outcome of the proposition involved is uncertain or when the evidence we have is inconclusive. For example, when a friend is worried about the outcome of an exam, we might reassure her by saying 'I have faith that you passed'; however, once she shows us that she got an A we would no longer say this. Clearly, this is not because we are less willing to acquiesce to the claim that she passed, but because we now know for certain that she did. For similar reasons, it seems odd to claim to have faith in logical truths. These considerations suggest that a person cannot have faith in propositions of which he is antecedently certain or for which he has conclusive evidence.3 Are there further 3 Although the following worry arises from the possibility of over-determination. I might have faith in my friend, and therefore have faith that my friend hasn't transformed me into a brain in a vat for his own merriment (this example is due to an anonymous referee), and yet I might be antecedently certain that I'm not a brain in a vat (on the basis of philosophical arguments, perhaps). Or I might have complete faith in a friend's testimony, and thus have faith in anything he says; however, it might be that he sometimes says things of which I am already certain. What should we say in these cases? One 4 restrictions on which propositions a person can have faith in? I don't believe so. Indeed, a person may have no evidence at all for the proposition he has faith in, or even may have evidence that tells against the proposition. For example, we could imagine someone saying 'Although she's spilled all the secrets I've told her so far, I have faith that this time will be different', or 'I don't think there's any evidence that God exists, but I have faith that he does'. Therefore, that a person has faith that X implies nothing about his evidence for X, aside from its inconclusiveness. Statements in which the actor has faith despite no or contrary evidence do seem correctly described as cases of faith, even though they are not cases in which we are inclined to think that the actor is wise to have faith; rather, we think his faith is misplaced. We will later see that we can do justice to the distinction between well-placed faith and misplaced faith. My final preliminary observation is that having faith seems to involve going beyond the evidence in some way. The bulk of my argument will be devoted to spelling out in what way one must go beyond the evidence in order to count as having faith. I postpone discussion of this to the next section. We can now begin to give a formal analysis of faith. As we've seen, the term 'faith' appears in many different grammatical constructions: you might have faith in a person, you might have faith in a proposition, you might perform an act of faith, or you might act on faith. We require an account that makes sense of all of these uses of the term. I've already pointed out that faith typically involves a proposition as well as an action to which the truth or falsity of the proposition makes a difference. I propose, then, to make faith that X, expressed by A the basic unit of analysis, where X is a proposition and A is an act, and define the other constructions in terms of this one. It is important that our analysis express the relationship between the proposition and the act. I have explained that a person can have faith that X only if he cares whether X is true or false, and presumably this is because the act of faith constitutes taking a risk on X. What is possible response is to say that a friend's testimony simply can't produce faith in propositions of which I am already certain. After all, we may think it sounds strange to say I am independently convinced that I can't be a brain in a vat, and I also have faith that you haven't envatted me. Another possibility is to claim that these statements, to the extent that we can imagine circumstances in which they could be uttered felicitously, are really modal in character: the actor is claiming that if she wasn't independently convinced that she wasn't a brain in a vat, she would have faith that you haven't envatted her. 5 it for an act to constitute taking a risk on a proposition? We can say that doing A constitutes an individual's taking a risk on X just in case there is some alternative available act B such that A is preferred to B on the supposition that X holds and B is preferred to A on the supposition that ~X holds. For example, telling my friend a secret constitutes taking a risk that she will keep it because on the supposition that she will keep it, I would rather tell her, but on the supposition that she won't keep it, I would rather not tell her. Whether an act constitutes a risk on X will of course be relative to the individual performing the act. So, as a first pass, we might say: A person has faith that X, expressed by A, only if that person performs act A and performing A constitutes taking a risk on X. This is not yet the whole story, but it does allow us to go a step further and identify what it is to have faith in a person, and to perform an act of faith: A person P has faith in another person Q if and only if there is some act A and some proposition(s) X that express(es) a positive judgment about Q such that P has faith that X, expressed by A. 4 So, Bob might have faith in Mary because he has faith that Mary won't reveal a secret he tells her, expressed by the act of telling her his secret. Paul might have faith in God because he has faith that God exists and that God is good, expressed by the act of praying. Again, faith only requires a disposition to choose particular acts, and these acts need not be actually available. We can now take the next step and identify what it is to perform an act of faith, or to act on faith: 4 Notice that the judgment must be positive from the point of view of the agent, in the sense that the agent has a preference for A on the supposition that X, otherwise the account would be subject to the following counterexample: we think that if a person prefers that his friend refrain from smoking, even though he thinks his friend is inclined to smoke, he can't appropriately be said to have faith that she will smoke. 6 A person performs an act of faith (or acts on faith) if and only if he performs some act A such that there is a proposition X in which he has faith, expressed by A. With these preliminaries in place, the rest of this paper will elaborate what else faith that X, expressed by A, requires and under what circumstances it is rational to have such faith. III. GOING BEYOND THE EVIDENCE: THREE VIEWS Before outlining my own view I consider three initially promising ways to make sense of the requirement that faith goes beyond the evidence. I conclude that each of these attempts fails to reveal a genuine requirement of faith. First, however, let me briefly say something about the philosophical framework in which I am working. One way to talk about belief states is as \"on\" or \"off\": you either believe something or you fail to believe it (this could be because you actively disbelieve it or because you withhold judgment from it). But notice that of the many things you believe, you are more confident of some than others; furthermore, of the many things you fail to believe, you take some to nonetheless be more likely than others. As evidence of these facts, we could ask you how much you are willing to bet on various propositions: in general, you will be willing to bet more (accept lower odds) on the ones in which you are more confident. To capture these facts, many philosophers have found it helpful to talk about belief states in a \"graded\" way: beliefs come in degrees (sometimes called 'credences' or 'subjective probabilities') between 0 and 1, and degrees of belief should behave like probabilities. For example, if you assign a degree of belief 0.7 to the claim that the Giants will win the World Series (p(GIANTS) = 0.7), then you should assign degree of belief 0.3 to the claim that the Giants won't win the World Series. As we will see later, degrees of belief underlie a formal theory of rational decision-making, but for now we can just notice that choosing an action is like taking a bet whose outcome is determined by the state of the world. For example, when one assigns p(RAIN) = 0.6 and p(NOT-RAIN) = 0.4, and one leaves the house without one's umbrella, one is taking a bet that involves a 60% chance of getting wet and a 40% chance of staying dry. With this framework in mind, let us consider some attempts to analyse the way in which faith goes beyond the evidence. The first analysis claims that faith in X requires 7 believing X to a higher degree than one thinks the evidence warrants.5 More precisely, for an agent to have faith that X, he must think that the evidence warrants believing X to some degree, say, r, but he nonetheless believes X to degree q, where q is greater than r. More particularly, one might think that faith requires believing X to degree 1 (being certain or fully confident that X), even though one thinks that the evidence warrants a definite credence less than this. On this analysis, having faith involves being entrenched in a kind of partial belief version of Moore's paradox: one thinks something like X is likely to degree r, but I believe X to degree q. Ignoring the issue of whether this could ever be rational-since we don't want to prejudge the issue by assuming there must be cases of rational faith-there are two problems with taking this to be a requirement of faith. First, it seems hard to imagine someone actually having faith in this sense and, especially, recognizing that he has faith in this sense. Yet having faith seems to be a common occurrence, one that does not involve psychological tricks or self-deception. Second, because it unclear that one can reliably or stably have faith in this sense, or even take steps to set oneself up to have faith in this sense, it does not seem to be the kind of thing that ethics would require. And yet, religious ethics and the ethics of friendship do seem to require faith in certain cases. The second analysis is more initially plausible. According to this, for the person who thinks that the evidence warrants believing X to degree r, faith requires acting as if he has degree of belief q-that is, performing the actions that he would perform if he had degree of belief q-where q is greater than r. For example, one would take the bets that would be rational to take if one had degree of belief r. Thus, one can maintain a degree of belief in r- and so avoid epistemic inconsistency-while still behaving, as regards the likelihood of X, in a way that goes beyond the evidence. Again, more particularly, we might think that faith requires acting as if you have credence 1, that is, using p(X) = 1 when making decisions. This would amount to acting as if one is certain that X: not considering or caring about states of the world in which ~X holds when making decisions. I admit that this analysis has some plausibility. However, I again think that there are problems concerning both the phenomenology and ethics of faith. 5 In some of the analyses under review here the act does not figure into the proposal. Therefore, for readability, I will say 'faith that X' or 'faith in X' when I really mean 'faith that X expressed by A, for some particular A'. 8 The phenomenological worry is that, on this analysis, faith requires simultaneously keeping track of two things: one's actual credences, and the 'faith-adjusted' credences that one employs in decision making. However, the phenomenology of faith doesn't seem to involve a lot of mental accounting. Yet perhaps this is not a serious problem, because the defender of this view could argue that since faith is relative to particular acts, one only needs to consider one's faith-adjusted credences when making the relevant decision. There are two more serious problems arising from the fact that although religious ethics and the ethics of friendship endorse faith in many situations, they wouldn't endorse certain demands that this analysis suggests. First, consider what this analysis recommends that a faithful person do when asked whether he believes that X. Since this is an action, presumably the faithful person ought, if he ought to have faith, to figure out what to do using his faith-adjusted credences, not his actual ones. So he ought to claim to believe X more strongly than he does; that is, he ought to lie. But those that endorse faith often strongly denounce lying. The second problem is brought to the fore when we consider the particular view that faith requires acting as if p(X) = 1. On this view, the faithful person ought to take any bet that is favourable on the condition that X obtains, regardless of the stakes. So, if asked to bet $1m on a gamble that pays 1 penny if X obtains, the person with faith in X ought to say yes: after all, he can disregard the possibility of ~X for the purposes of decision making. I'm extremely doubtful that religious ethics would endorse the claim that the truly faithful ought to risk $1m for a mere penny if God exists, especially since they recognize that the evidence isn't conclusive.6 So we can dismiss the first two analyses which held that in order for a person to count as having faith that X, he must treat his credence in X as higher than it in fact is, either by actually raising it or by acting as if it were higher. Perhaps these analyses have gone astray because they took for granted an inadequate account of when faith enters into one's belief formation process. They both assume that one examines all of the evidence dispassionately, forms a belief, and then decides whether to adjust this belief in light of faith. But perhaps the 6 Perhaps the defender of the second analysis could claim that his view doesn't entail an affirmative answer because betting itself, when the payoffs are so frivolous, has an inherent disutility. But it is not clear that he can respond in this way to the case in which the 'payoffs' are goods of real value, e.g., in the gamble that results in a million lives lost if God doesn't exist and one life improved mildly if God does exist. 9 relationship between faith and belief formation is more complex than this assumption recognizes. Instead, faith might require taking evidence into account in a particular way-a way that favours X or gives the truth of X the benefit of the doubt, so to speak. Following this line of thought, a third analysis of faith holds that faith requires setting one's degree of belief to p(X) = 1 prior to examining the evidence. On this view, one interprets evidence, not with an eye towards finding out whether or not X holds, but in light of the assumption that X does hold. On this view, we might say that faith goes before the evidence, not beyond it. Note that this third analysis is different from the 'special cases' of the first two analyses. On those analyses, the faithful individual sets p(X) = 1 (either in his beliefs or for his actions) even though he believes that the evidence warrants something less. On the present analysis the agent doesn't have an opinion about what the evidence warrants that is separate from the question of whether he has faith. So let's say that I have faith that my friend won't reveal a secret I told him, and I overhear a third party complaining that my friend is a gossip. On the first analysis, I consider this to be evidence against the claim that my friend will keep my secret, but I nonetheless ignore it and continue to have a high degree of belief in the claim. On the second analysis, I consider this to be evidence against the claim, and I lower my degree of belief in the claim, but I nonetheless continue to act as if I have a high degree of belief (I carry on as if no one knows my secret, and I continue to confide in this friend). On the analysis we are now considering, I don't consider this to be evidence against the claim, precisely because I have faith in the claim. Indeed, there will be no possible evidence that tells against X. This third analysis has a number of advantages. For one, it sheds light on the fact that there seems to be no good answer to the question of how a rational person ought to set his credences before encountering any evidence. On this view, the reason that there is no good answer is that epistemic rationality stops just short of this question and faith takes over: one can't avoid having faith in something, because one can't avoid setting one's initial credences.7 This vindicates William James' claim that one's non-rational or 'passional' nature must determine what to believe when reason alone doesn't dictate an answer, and that the passional nature generally comes into play in figuring out how to interpret evidence (see James 1896). It also supports an insight of Søren Kierkegaard's pseudonymous Johannes 7 Technically, one could avoid having complete faith in anything, since one could avoid setting p(X) = 1 for all X. However, if we think that degrees of faith correspond to setting lower initial credences, then one would have some degree of faith in many things. 10 Climacus that reason alone cannot produce faith; instead, faith requires an act of will (see Kierkegaard 1846). Roughly, Climacus argues that one can never get to religious faith by engaging in objective inquiry because religious faith requires total commitment to particular historical claims. Objective inquiry can never yield certainty in these matters: it always leaves room for doubt. On Robert Adam's interpretation of Kierkegaard, total commitment to a belief requires a commitment not to revise it in the future (see Adams 1976). Thus, it requires setting p(X) = 1 and interpreting any new evidence in light of this. However, despite its attractiveness, this view is incorrect because it is vulnerable to similar phenomenological and ethical objections to the ones discussed above. Adams himself raises the ethical objection: 'It has commonly been thought to be an important part of religious ethics that one ought to be humble, teachable, open to correction, new inspiration, and growth of insight, even (and perhaps especially) in important religious beliefs' (Adams 1976: 233). We might add that the ethics involved in friendship similarly do not seem to require that we remain determined not to abandon our belief in a friend's trustworthiness come what may. The phenomenological objection can be bought out by considering that anyone who is acting on faith typically feels like she is taking a risk of some sort. The act A that you are performing on faith (that X) is supposed to be better than some alternative if X holds and worse than that alternative if X does not hold. But if one is certain that X holds, then doing A is not a risk at all. On the contrary, A is simply an act that, from your point of view, will undoubtedly turn out well. It is like the act of taking a bet on which you win $100 if water is H2O and lose $100 if it is not. One might reply that from an objective standpoint, doing A is a risk-because setting one's initial credences is risky in some sense. But even if that is the case, the view still fails to explain the phenomenology of acts of faith, since they feel risky even from an internal perspective. What is distinctive about taking a leap of faith, so to speak, is that you are fully aware that it might turn out badly-even if you think that it is unlikely that it will. An additional objection to this third analysis is that it cannot distinguish between cases of well-placed faith and cases of misplaced faith. Recall the above example of the person who knows that her friend has spilled all of her secrets so far but who has faith that he will not spill future secrets. We likely regard this as a case of misplaced faith. At any rate, when we compare this person to the person whose friend has never spilled a secret and who has faith that he will not spill future secrets, we think that this second person's faith has a lot more in its favour. But we cannot make sense of this on the present view, since rationality has 11 no conclusions about which initial credences are laudable and since faith enters the picture before any evidence is interpreted. So, although this third analysis was initially promising, it does not ultimately succeed. On my view, whether someone has faith is not determinable from the credences he brings to the table before examining evidence: a person who starts out sceptical, but who then amasses evidence in favour of X, could indeed end up choosing to have faith that X (consider the conversion of St Paul). Furthermore, a person who begins by assuming that X must be true doesn't thereby count as having faith that X: credulity and faith come apart. So do credence and faith, as we will see in the next section. IV. FAITH AND EXAMINING FURTHER EVIDENCE There is something to Kierkegaard's idea that one can never arrive at faith by engaging in empirical inquiry-that faith instead requires an act of will. However, this is not because faith requires a kind of certainty that empirical inquiry cannot provide, nor because faith must precede inquiry. Instead, it is because engaging in an inquiry itself constitutes a lack of faith. That is, faith requires not engaging in an inquiry whose only purpose is to figure out the truth of the proposition one purportedly has faith in. So the sense in which faith in X requires some response to the evidence aside from that normally warranted by epistemic norms is that it requires a decision to stop searching for additional evidence and to perform the act one would perform on the supposition that X. Consider an example. If a man has faith that his spouse isn't cheating, this seems to rule out his hiring a private investigator, opening her mail, or even striking up a conversation with her boss to check that she really was working late last night-that is, it rules out conducting an inquiry to verify that his spouse isn't cheating. If he does any of these things, then she can rightfully complain that he didn't have faith in her, even if she realizes that, given his evidence, he should not assign degree of belief 1 to her constancy. Similarly, if I have faith that my friend will keep a secret, this seems to rule out asking a third party whether he thinks that friend is trustworthy. To use a religious example, when so-called 'doubting' Thomas asks to put his hand in Jesus' side to verify that he has been resurrected in the flesh, this is supposed to indicate that he lacks faith. We can say something even stronger: faith seems to require not looking for further evidence even if one knows that the evidence is readily available. For example, consider a case in which a man simply stumbles across an envelope which he knows contains evidence 12 that will either vindicate his wife's constancy or suggest that she has been cheating. He seems to display a lack of faith in her constancy if he opens it and to display faith in her constancy if he does not. And this seems true even if the evidence has been acquired in a scrupulous way: we might imagine the wife herself presents the envelope to the man, as a test of his faith.8 So we now have the following first pass at a full analysis of faith: A person has faith that X, expressed by A, if and only if that person performs act A, and performing A constitutes taking a risk on X; and the person refrains from gathering further evidence to determine the truth or falsity of X, or would refrain, if further evidence were available. This formulation has an unfortunate upshot, though: it implies that anyone who has faith that X, expressed by some act A, must decline evidence in the matter of X even if he wants the evidence for purposes other than deciding between the available acts. For example, consider the Christian apologist who has faith that Jesus was resurrected (expressed by, say, the action of going to church every week) but who combs through the historical evidence surrounding Jesus' resurrection in the hopes of finding evidence to convince someone who does not believe. Or consider the person who intends to open the private investigator's envelope publicly precisely to show that he has faith in his spouse's constancy.9 On the current analysis, neither of these acts can be acts of faith: indeed, performing them entails that the agent does not have faith in the proposition in question. The reason that we would say that the apologist has faith in the resurrection even though he continues to look for evidence is that he doesn't consider his decision to attend church dependent on the outcome of his investigation. Indeed, if he had no desire to convince other people, he would not look for evidence. Similarly, the reason we know that the husband has faith in his spouse, expressed by, say, the action of remaining constant himself, is that his constancy doesn't depend on the contents of the envelope, even though it does depend on his (current) beliefs about whether his spouse is cheating. So what these examples show is that the claim that the faithful person does not look for evidence at all is too strong. Instead, the 8 Indeed, my account can easily explain why presenting him with the envelope could be a test of faith: it is a test to see whether he will choose to acquire further evidence. 9 Thanks to Sherrilyn Roush for this example. 13 faithful person does not look for evidence for the purposes of deciding whether to do A. Thus, if he does look for evidence, he considers this search irrelevant to his decision to do A. A precise way to spell out that the act doesn't depend on the evidence is that the faithful agent is willing to commit to A before viewing any additional evidence in the matter of X; indeed, he wants to commit to A. In preference terms, he prefers to commit to A before viewing any additional evidence rather than to first view additional evidence and then decide whether to do A. This covers both the case of the person who looks for no additional evidence and the person who does look for evidence, but not in order to decide whether to do A. We can now formulate my final analysis: A person has faith that X, expressed by A, if and only if that person performs act A, and performing A constitutes taking a risk on X; and the person prefers {to commit to A before he examines additional evidence} rather than {to postpone his decision about A until he examines additional evidence}.10 As mentioned above, my analysis vindicates part of Kierkegaard's insight that faith does require total commitment, and that looking for evidence reveals that one is not totally committed. But what one must commit to is an act, not a belief: specifically, one must commit to performing an act regardless of what the evidence reveals. My analysis also vindicates the idea that faith requires an act of will-on my account one consciously chooses not to look for more evidence (even though doing so might be tempting!)-which is difficult to explain if faith requires a certain degree of belief and belief is not directly under one's volitional control. One upshot of my analysis is that it is possible for two people to have the same evidence, have the same probability function, value the possible outcomes in the same way, and perform the same act, and yet one of these acts displays faith while the other doesn't. So, for example, assume Ann and Erin have the same evidence about Dan's secret-keeping ability; that both have p(Dan will keep a secret) = 0.9; and that both have the same utility 10 I formulate this condition in terms of preference because the theory of practical rationality that forms the basis of the discussion in the rest of this paper concerns preferences rather than choices. I note, however, that if the reader finds it more natural to formulate this condition in terms of a disposition to choose to commit to A, rather than formulating it in terms of a preference to commit to A, that is acceptable. (In any case, preference is strongly linked to a disposition to choose.) 14 functions (that is, the stakes are the same for both of them). Now assume that each has a choice whether to ask a third party what he thinks about Dan's secret-keeping ability before deciding whether to tell Dan her secret. Ann decides to simply tell her secret; Erin decides to ask the third party, and then ends up telling her secret to Dan on the advice of this third party. Here, Ann displays faith that Dan will keep a secret (expressed by the act of revealing her own secret), whereas Erin does not display faith, even though she also performs this act. So the same act in the same circumstances can be done with or without faith. The argument so far has told us nothing about the circumstances, if indeed there are any, in which faith can be rational. I now turn to this question. First I briefly explain the distinction between epistemic rationality and practical rationality, beginning with the former. V. EPISTEMIC AND PRACTICAL RATIONALITY I will assume a broadly evidentialist conception of epistemic rationality: one should proportion one's beliefs to one's evidence. One should not, for example, simply believe what one likes or believe what would make one happy. More generally, one should not take nontruth-conducive reasons as reasons for belief. I will also make some fairly standard assumptions about degrees of belief: degrees of belief obey the probability calculus; one updates one's beliefs by conditionalizing on new evidence; and two people can (rationally) have different degrees of belief in a proposition if and only if they have different evidence that bears on that proposition, or they believe the same evidence bears on that proposition differently, or they have different initial degrees of belief. An important upshot of these assumptions is that a rational person can only change his degrees of belief in response to evidence-and, in fact, must update them in response to new evidence, at least in matters he cares enough about to form beliefs. Epistemic rationality concerns believing what the evidence suggests. Practical rationality, on the other hand, concerns selecting the means to achieve one's ends. An informal way to characterize practical rationality is that it consists in taking the means to one's ends. And just as philosophers use a formal theory (probability theory) to characterize epistemic rationality more precisely, so too do they use a formal theory to characterize instrumental rationality more precisely: decision theory. Recall the earlier point that an action is essentially a gamble in which the state of the world determines which outcome you get. We already know that we can represent the likelihood you assign to various states – and thus the likelihood that an act will lead to each particular outcome – by a degree 15 of belief function. According to decision theory, we can also represent how much you value particular outcomes by a 'utility' function.11 On the standard view, subjective expected utility (EU) theory, rational agents maximize expected utility: they prefer the act with the highest mathematical expectation of utility, relative to their utility and credence functions. Here 'mathematical expectation' just means a weighted average: the value of each outcome is weighted by the likelihood of getting that outcome, and the resultant values are summed. So, for example, if p(RAIN) = 0.6 and p(NOT-RAIN) = 0.4, and if u(getting wet) = -3 and u(staying dry) = 2, then EU(don't bring umbrella) = 0.6(-3) + 0.4(2) = -1. If EU(bring umbrella) = u(carrying around an umbrella) > -1, then a rational decision-maker will bring her umbrella. In my view, EU theory is too restrictive. However, since this is the widely accepted view, and since I agree that expected utility maximizers are practically rational (I merely hold that there are other ways to be rational as well), I will postpone discussion of an alternative view to section IX. Before turning to the question of whether faith can be rational, it is worth clearing up a worry: that the definitions of rationality that I've adopted might not be strong enough. On the present definition of epistemic rationality, one may adopt any degrees of belief, including any degrees of belief concerning the relationship between particular hypotheses and particular pieces of evidence, as long as one's degrees of belief cohere with each other. For example, a person may rationally believe he has been abducted by aliens, as long as he also believes that the evidence he has supports this to the degree that he believes it. A similar point holds about preferences in the case of practical rationality. Both epistemic rationality and practical rationality, as I define them here, are notions of consistency: the only restriction on degrees of belief is that they are consistent with one another, and the only restriction on preferences is that they are consistent with one another, given one's degrees of belief in each possible state of the world. However, there is another notion of rationality, which rules out believing one has been abducted by aliens and rules out certain preferences, which we might call reasonableness. I cannot fully respond to this worry in depth here. But it is important that the consistency notion of rationality and the reasonableness notion come apart quite readily. Consistency restrictions are structural: they rule out particular patterns of belief or desire, regardless of the content of these attitudes. On the other hand, reasonableness restrictions are 11 On the debate between realism and functionalism about the utility function, see J. Dreier (1996). 16 substantial: they rule out particular beliefs or desires, regardless of which other beliefs or desires one has. Therefore, we can talk about what they require separately, and this project is about the requirements of rationality in the consistency sense. Or, since this sense of rationality exhausts the subjective sense of rationality, this project addresses the question of whether it can ever be rational given the agent's own attitudes to have faith. If we want to answer the further question of whether it is reasonable to have faith-that is, of whether a person has objective reasons to have faith-we can address this separately. Indeed, nothing in my argument relies on the content of the propositions believed or desired. Hence the question of whether faith is reasonable can be answered by asking whether there are any contents for which it is reasonable to have the patterns of belief and desire presented in my examples. Finally, I want to be clear that I am not assuming here that there are any benefits to believing false propositions, or to holding certain beliefs regardless of whether they are true. In my analysis, I assume that knowing the truth in the matter of X is always beneficial to the agent who is making a decision based on X: it allows her to choose the action that in fact turns out better for her. VI. PRACTICAL RATIONALITY AND EVIDENCE-GATHERING It should be clear that on the first two analyses of faith, considered in section III, above, faith is irrational. On the first analysis, which requires the agent's credences to be higher than those the evidence suggests, faith is epistemically irrational, and on the second analysis, which requires the agent to act as if his beliefs are different than they are (that is, to take something other than his credences as 'what he believes' for the purposes of decision making), faith is practically irrational, however we spell out practical rationality. On the third analysis, faith is always rational, provided one has consistent credences and preferences (though one can't, for example, have faith in two contradictory propositions). On my analysis faith can also be epistemically rational: that one has faith in X implies nothing about one's degrees of belief or the consistency thereof.12 Therefore, one can clearly meet the requirements of epistemic rationality, as I've stated them, while having faith- 12 Technically, it implies that p(X) ≠ 1, but if p(X) = 1 then X is not an appropriate object of faith, so this is not a restriction on one's credences, but on what can count as an object of faith. 17 whether one has faith is completely separate from whether one is epistemically rational because it is separate from whether one has appropriately evaluated the evidence one has.13 But can faith also be practically rational? Faith requires two actions: choosing A rather than the alternatives and not looking for further evidence for the purposes of this choice (or committing to A before seeing further evidence rather than seeing further evidence before deciding). Therefore, faith can only be practically rational if both of these actions are practically rational. Assessing the rationality of the first action is fairly straightforward: choosing A rather than the alternatives is rational just in case A has a higher expected utility than the alternatives, given the agent's credences. So the first (fairly obvious) restriction on when faith is rational is this: one's credence in X must be sufficiently high as to make A the practically rational act. What about the second action? Can it be rational to committo A rather than seeing more evidence before deciding? To address this question, it will help to have a canonical example of the kinds of situations in which the question of faith arises. Again, these situations involve an agent performing an act A in a situation in which the status of some proposition X is in question, and in which there is an alternative B such that he prefers A to B on the supposition that X, and B to A on the supposition that ~X. Let us simplify by assuming that A and B are the only two alternatives, and that B is such that its value does not depend on X, that is, the outcome of B is not affected by whether X holds.14 To put some concrete utility values in place: u(A&X) = 10 u(B&X) = 1 u(A&~X) = 0 u(B&~X) = 1 13 Even if epistemic rationality requires that one look for further evidence, it will not conflict with faith on my definition, since having faith doesn't forbid one from looking for evidence; it only dictates that one must commit to an act before seeing more evidence to postponing the decision. 14 We can represent this by stating that the individual is indifferent between B&X and B&~X. What if X is something that the agent strongly prefers to be true, so that A&X and B&X both have a high utility? One might think, for example, that faith in God is typically like this, since the agent often prefers worlds in which God exists to worlds in which God does not exist, regardless of the agent's choices. As it turns out, the assumption that the agent is indifferent between B&X and B&~X is not crucial to the results discussed here: see Buchak (2012) for details. 18 We could generalize by assuming there is a high value, a middle value, and a low value such that u(A&X) = H, u(B&X) = u(B&~X) = M, u(A&~X) = L, and H > M > L. In other words: A performed when X holds yields the best outcome, A performed when ~X holds yields the worst outcome, and B performed either way yields an intermediate outcome. Here are some examples of decisions that might include the relevant values. Consider an individual who is deciding whether to become a monk and does not have conclusive evidence that God exists. If God exists, then becoming a monk is very good-the individual will experience all the goods of the religious life. But if God does not exist, then becoming a monk will result in the agent living a life that is ultimately wasted. On the other hand, failing to become a monk is fine, but not great, either way, if we assume that from a religious point of view becoming a monk is supererogatory and that the individual lives roughly the same life as a non-monk whether or not God exists. To take another example, consider an individual who is deciding whether to use his van to transport 10 critically injured patients to the hospital rather than using his car to transport 1 and who does not have conclusive evidence that his van works (but he has, say, near-conclusive evidence that his car works, or a backup plan in case it doesn't). Or consider an individual who is deciding whether to reveal a secret to someone else, and who does not have conclusive evidence that the friend will keep it; or an individual who is deciding whether to marry a particular person, and does not have conclusive evidence that this person will make a good spouse. In each case, performing the act could turn out very well or poorly, whereas not performing the act is the same either way.15 We could think of the act as an opportunity for something great-but a risky opportunity-that one might take or pass up. Let us assume that given the individual's current credences and utility function, A has a higher expected utility than B, and so A is practically rational given the individual's current information. Now we want to know whether practical rationality requires that the individual gather more information before she makes her decision. There is a theorem that bears directly on this question: I. J. Good (1967) showed that gathering additional evidence (in Good's 15 One might argue that the act couldn't be the same either way, since, e.g., passing up the possibility of a faithful spouse (or an opportunity to save 10 lives) is worse than passing up the possibility of an unfaithful spouse (or an opportunity not to save any lives). I think the question of how decision theory should handle these nuances is an interesting one, but for now, I will just assume that facts about what might have happened do not make a difference to the agent's utility function-or at least that they make a negligible difference. 19 terminology, making a new observation) and then using it to update one's beliefs before making a decision always has a higher expected utility than making a decision without doing so, provided the following two conditions are met: (1) It is not the case that the agent will perform the same act regardless of the evidence she receives. (2) Gathering additional evidence is cost-free. If condition (2) holds but, contrary to (1), the agent will perform the same act regardless of the evidence, then gathering the evidence will have the same expected utility as not doing so.16 In other words, if these two conditions are met, and if rational individuals must choose the act that maximizes expected utility, then it is always rationally permissible to make a new observation and use it, and it is rationally required that one do so if some piece of evidence that might result from doing so will lead one to do B instead of A. VII. COMMITMENT AND INTERPERSONAL COST We can now consider under which circumstances, if any, one is rationally permitted, or rationally required, to have faith. In this section and the next I spell out when it is rational to refrain from examining additional evidence for the purposes of the choice at hand.

I also assume, as Good does, that for each 'experiment' (or bit of searching) the agent is considering performing, the agent can assign credences to the experiment yielding each possible result, \n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "102e5a80-1f71-406b-bb7b-c595e1b9bee4", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "思路内容：宗教哲学讨论"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "82cbb614-a86d-4d6c-bf39-784b39cfd4e3", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "有逻辑性的文章"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "f97e55dc-f9df-4ab3-98aa-e51bb6235b6c", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 知识性内容，包含前言等"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "3acb3233-b946-44e4-ad7f-4288ab502ffd", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "文章，挺有逻辑"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

He said he previously maximum value having their girlfriend, nevertheless the interests is actually went. He reach feel like they were very best friends, however, personal like was not expose.\nOne other reason one will not commit to a marriage also even in the event he wants a woman is the fact their lifestyle requirements is maybe not lined up which have hers.

It could be since the their goal is not to track down a woman to blow the rest of their lifestyle having.

If you’ve been relationships men for some time in which he enjoys yet to ask that marry him, you are curious, as to why claimed’t he query me to wed your? When your matchmaking appears to be a beneficial total it looks like a scientific step when planning on taking it to the next level. And yet, the kid isn’t in a hurry so you can decide to your.\nYou are heading crazy trying see the hidden explanations for their insufficient connection otherwise desire to formalize the connection by creating the marriage vows, yet, the cause of men’s resistance making a suggestion is not as hard to learn once you know the thought procedure for an everyday child as he is in a significant experience of a woman.\nA frequent man exactly who doesn’t need married try happy with how relationship can be as long as he gets everything the guy need from the dating.

But if you are inquiring, exactly what a whole lot more do i need to maybe provide him, it is possible to currently end up being giving him all of the he wants.\nI am also not to imply you ought to stop what you’re doing, no less than not every one of things that you will do, but simply particular chosen things. If you were extremely enjoyable towards the sweetheart, maybe you is always to place on your own first and have your self, what exactly is it that we wanted? Have always been We bringing every I want using this relationships or was We settling for below We need? Should your answer is the latter, replace the fictional character of relationship. Granted, you should place the people you adore first, but merely he’s performing a comparable to you personally. If the guy throws their goals over you, carry out the same. On condition that one another persons are on an equivalent webpage, will you go equilibrium in your dating.\nAnother reason one boys don’t invest in marriage is they are simply just unclear they wish to spend the rest of their life through its most recent girlfriends. Generate Your Commit teaches you as to the reasons men who currently have girlfriends, and are generally actually managing its girlfriends is actually reluctant to while making a wedding commitment. It’s not too he could be commitment phobics; it’s simply while they areing date using their girlfriends so to dicuss. He is being unsure of whether or not they want to make an union so you can the most recent girlfriends. In reality, the alternative is true – he is certain that its girlfriends aren’t the people to help you spend the remainder of its life that have.

Field of the Invention\nThis invention relates to a structure of treating the terminal (end) of a shield wire (hereinafter referred to as \"a shield wire's terminal treatment structure, or terminal treatment structure\", when applicable) which may be connected to a variety of electrical devices such as an electric motor in an electric car for instance.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nIn general, in the case where a current supplying wire or control signal wire is connected to an electric device mounted on a vehicle such as an electric car, it is often required to subject the wire to electro-magnetic shield treatment or water-proof treatment. The electro-magnetic shield treatment is performed to prevent the electric device from being made unstable in operation by a variety of noises. The water-proof treatment is performed to prevent the electrical contact portion or the like from being damaged by water drops or the like which may enter the electric device along the electric wire.\nAn example of the above-described conventional electro-magnetic shield treatment or water-proof treatment is a terminal treatment structure 100 as shown in FIG. 8.\nThe terminal treatment structure 100 is designed as follows: A shield electric wire 101 with a braid 104 exposed, is inserted into a water-proof grommet 115 under pressure, and then inserted in a metal casing 111 of an electrical device or the like. Inside the metal casing, a conductor 102 covered with an insulating cover 103 is extended as long as required for wiring from the end portion of the braid 104. A connecting terminal 110 such as a crimping terminal, which is to be connected to a terminal (not shown) of the electrical device, is secured to the conductor 102.\nIn the terminal treatment structure 100, the water-proof treatment is as follows: The water-proof grommet 115, which is made of insulating material such as synthetic rubber, is put on the shield wire 101, and the grommet 115 is press-fitted in the metal casing 111 to keep an outer cover 105 water-tight in the metal casing 111.\nThe electro-magnetic shield treatment is as follows: A metal shield connection ring 118, which is connected to the braid 104, is mounted on the end of the water-proof grommet 115, so that the braid 104 is electrically connected to the metal casing 111.\nThe shield connection ring 118 comprises: an inner cylindrical portion 119A which is inserted between the braid 104 and the insulating cover 103 covering the conductor 102 so that it is electrically connected to the braid 104; and an outer cylindrical portion 119B which covers the outer peripheral portion of the water-proof grommet 115 so that it is electrically connected to the metal casing 111. That is, the ring 118 is of a double-crown structure. Hence, the electro-magnetic shielding is achieved when the braid 104 of the shield wire 101 is electrically connected through the shield connection ring 118 to the metal casing 111.\nIn the above-described terminal treatment structure 100, as was described above the inner cylindrical portion 119A of the shield connection ring 118 is inserted between the insulating cover 103 and the braid 104, and the outer cylindrical portion 119B is arranged between the grommet 115 and the metal casing 111. Hence, the shield connection ring 118 acts to fix the whole terminal (end) of the shield wire 100, thus preventing the axial movement of the shield wire 100.\nHence, in the case where, in connecting the connecting terminal 110 to the connecting terminal of the electrical device, the conductor 102 covered with the insulating cover 103 is not long enough, so that it is impossible to adjust the length of the conductor 102.\nFurthermore, it is impossible to provide simple locking means between the shield connection ring 118 and the water-proof grommet 115. Therefore, the shield connection ring 118 may be disengaged from the water-proof grommet 115. In this case, the electrical connection between the braid and the metal casing 111 is diminished. In order to eliminate this difficulty, in the conventional terminal treatment structure, as shown in FIG. 9, the metal casing 111 has a stepped wire inserting inlet 112. The shield connection ring 118 is abutted against the wire inserting inlet 112 so that the shield connection ring 118 may not come off the water-proof grommet 115. However, the above-described conventional structure is disadvantageous in that the metal casing 111 must be machined, and accordingly the structure is high in manufacturing cost.\n\n", "final_result_str": "Notsure", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "d06bba52-9211-40ff-adf7-8a900ab83655", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "1. 没找到原网页；\n2. 专利介绍，语句流畅，\n3. 语法报错九个；"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "e3452d17-7c4c-477f-9749-14cf7d5d5bb0", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "专利"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "22eea353-4f60-43b3-9806-ec9a1a88017c", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "need_repair", "evidence": "逻辑清晰，但是有很多序号，建议删去"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "4abf92ff-a5cd-43f6-9ab8-5464821a6535", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 知识性内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Therefore, for example, their length, their diameter and also various elements of the injection valve being responsible for the way the fluid is dosed may vary in a wide range. In addition to that, injection valves may accommodate an actuator for actuating a valve needle of the injection valve, which may, for example, be an electromagnetic actuator.\nIn order to enhance the combustion process in view of the creation of unwanted emissions, the respective injection valve may be suited to dose fluids under very high pressures. The pressures may be in case of a gasoline engine, for example, in the range of up to 200 bar and in the case of diesel engines in the range of up to 2000 bar.\nAfter a desired injection during the injector closing phase a post injection can occur caused by an injector reopening. Current injector design includes very often a needle armature de-coupled feature. This design increases the impact between armature and upper armature retainer and also allows the needle to have the so called needle overshoot behavior. The needle overshoot happens during the injector standard operating mode: there is a needle overshoot during the needle opening phase. The needle overshoot during the opening phase occurs after that the armature impacts the pole piece impact face. When the armature stops and bounces against the pole piece impact face, the needle continues its motions by the effect of its inertia. By means of this phenomenon the opening phase is controlled for the armature but it is not controlled for the needle. Since the needle movement is responsible for fuel delivery, it happens that just at the end of the opening phase the needle is not in a controlled position in respect to the injector seat. This is unfavorable injector behavior and it impacts in particular way the minimum controllable deliverable flow. Due to the opening phase needle overshoot behavior, the minimum controllable flow quantity is increased. During the closing phase the armature overshoot occurs in the opposite direction, the armature detaches from the armature upper retainer and compresses the anti bounce spring eliminating the needle bounce at closing. Once that the anti bounce spring is compressed it releases the stored energy pushing again the armature against the upper armature retainer generating the unwanted and uncontrolled operating condition of the so called post injection.\n\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "761e221b-ac0e-4e09-857e-796ea1583802", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "知识性内容：喷射阀相关\n逻辑性内容：学术性论述"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "45dc23a7-0cd7-4575-bf06-4da108a1e9b5", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "1. 喷射阀的介绍\n2. 语法错误19个"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "5be3a7ca-8124-4866-8308-ea071cb4e99b", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "具有逻辑性的介绍"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "b44b580f-3f90-4c86-beb1-14239d499b63", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 知识性内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Someone was clearly playing some kind of twisted game with us. Garbed as our captor’s favorite horror movie characters, we were locked away and left to our own devices to find our way out. This horror escape room had us on edge as each of us were challenged to overcome obstacles with merely a trace of help from our trusted comrades.\nCrossroads, also the creator of The Fun House, has really outdone themselves with this escape room experience. It is refreshing to experience a room that delivers awe-inspiring moments around each corner.\nThe start of our experience with Crossroads was pretty average- a nice waiting room and signing waivers. However, upon entering the game, you will notice the quality of the set and structure of this room is visually remarkable! With each member of the team in their own uniquely-themed chamber, each of us was granted a totally different experience. Is it actually scary? In my opinion, no. There are no startles or gore related décor. However, if you are sensitive to even slightly creepy themes, you may disagree with me.\nThe Hex Room is a prime example for how space can be used to make your players feel more fully immersed. Playing The Detective, I got to see each of the players in their own environment (through barred windows or tiny slots). It was my duty to help others in their own path and make connections between them, which of course brought an entire new level of involvement to this scenario.\nThe puzzles were well integrated, many of them overlapping between the multiple themes within the room. Though the types of puzzles were not entirely unique, they were extremely well executed. There are a lot of them, and we did find them rather difficult. However, this game is designed to where you can absolutely come back to play another character with an entirely new set of puzzles to face. There is even a BONUS game (best left for after the end so you don’t run out of time).\nI think that everyone should visit The Hex Room to see what a quality game really looks like. Even if you are like us and don’t get very far, the experience is really worth it. This room will absolutely spoil experienced players who are tired of the usual escape room experience, and will blow the minds of new players! Play this room.

He was widely recognized to be startlingly strong and a phenomenally accurate passer. During his college career he finished two full seasons without any interceptions and two games with 100 percent completions. Unfortunately, he wasn't drafted because the pro teams felt he was too small.\n\nKristen Taylor captained her college soccer team and was extraordinarily quick. She rarely played a game without a \"steal\" and usually had many.\n\nAllan and Kristen dated more and more seriously throughout college and married at the end of their senior year. Their friends teased them that they were only marrying so that they could start their own sports dynasty.\n\nTheir daughter Ell had Kristen's quickness, magnified by Allan's strength and accuracy. The child also had a new mutation affecting the myelin sheaths surrounding her nerves. This mutation produced nerve transmission speeds that were nearly double those of normal neurons. Nerve impulse transmissions being faster, she had much quicker reflexes. Yet the new myelin sheath was also thinner, allowing more axons, and therefore more neurons, to be packed into the same sized skull. These two factors resulted in a brain which had more neurons, though it wasn't larger and a more rapid processing speed, akin to a computer with a smaller scale CPU architecture that enables faster processor speeds.\n\nMost importantly, under the influence of adrenalin in a \"fight or flight\" situation, her nerves would transmit even more rapidly than their normally phenomenal speed.\n\nMuch more rapidly...\n\nPrologue\n\nNew York— Senator Edith Blaustein (R- NY) with the support of Francis Ementhal, renowned astrophysicist from the Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics at NYU, have submitted a bill aimed directly at Ell Donsaii. This legislation would require Dr. Donsaii to turn over all methods and equipment used in their exploration of the third planet of the star Tau Ceti.\n\nEmenthal says that the methods used to send probes to the stars represent a technological leap forward that must be made available to the entire human race. He says it also \"borders on the insane that a girl, only twenty-four years of age, is acting as de facto ambassador for the human race in our initial interactions with the other inhabitants of our Universe.\" He proposes that a new national committee would be put in charge of alien contact.\n\nInterestingly, Dr. Daniel Hage, Ementhal's own Department Chair at NYU is vehemently opposes to this proposed legislation...\n\nKant Fladwami entered the Oval Office and took the seat indicated by President Flood. Attorney General Aaron Blythe and Secretary of Defense Amundsen, a holdover from the previous administration, sat in the other chairs. Flood turned to Fladwami, \"Kant, in our conversations you've recommended that we not pressure Donsaii to release her interstellar tech to Ementhal's proposed committee of eminent scientists. So far I've agreed with you, but now that Ementhal has got Blaustein taking a bill to Congress we're going to have to do more than 'just say no.' I wanted to have you review your rationale with me again. Aaron will hopefully apprise me of the legal ramifications.\" He waved at Amundsen, \"And I'd like Mark's opinion too. He's known Donsaii a lot longer than either of us, and after all, he's the one that would be responsible for defending us if she does bring the Huns from outer space down on us.\"\n\nKant took a deep breath and glanced at Amundsen. \"Well, the issues are tremendously complex. I take Ementhal's point that encounters with possibly inimical alien races carry tremendous risk, not just for the United States, but for the human race in general. Where he and I differ is in regards to the question of who best should curate these endeavors and risks. Ementhal contends that a committee of brilliant scientists—to which, I would point out, he has had to add politicians in order to get the support of Blaustein and Congress...\" Kant shrugged, \"In any case, a committee... of hopefully brilliant people. He feels such a committee is needed to avoid the possibility of a faux pas in our interactions with an alien race.\" Fladwami looked from the President to Amundsen and sighed, \"Gentlemen, I do not trust committees. In the face of a need for urgent decision, they are often extraordinarily clumsy. I suspect that in such endeavors secrecy may sometimes be necessary, and that such a committee could not be relied upon to maintain that secrecy. Personally, I would prefer to rely on one brilliant person; a person already awarded the Medal of Honor and the Medal of Freedom for exemplary service to our country. I trust Ell Donsaii, whereas no matter how such a committee might be formed, I will never be able to fully trust it.\"\n\nAmundsen opened his mouth to speak but Fladwami put up a hand to forestall him. He said, \"One more point, Mark. I don't think that Donsaii is willing to turn the equipment or the methods over to such a committee. She won't trust them any more than I do. Trying to force her to release that tech might backfire in the worst way.\"\n\n\"Backfire?\" Amundsen said.\n\n\"Backfire,\" Fladwami said emphatically. \"Donsaii has singlehandedly advanced technology and created wealth at a faster pace than any other individual in history.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Blythe interjected, \"all I hear about is how she's destroying the economy.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Fladwami chuckled, \"she's certainly disturbed the economy. With so much change there will, of course, be people losing their jobs. Railroads took jobs from drovers, electricity took jobs from lamp salesmen, and the internet destroyed newspapers. We don't have milkmen anymore either. Now Donsaii's PGR chips are turning the telecomm industry upside down and her ports are revolutionizing transportation. But... they're letting us do things better... and cheaper... so the people who do have jobs can buy things cheaper. The 'woe is me' people aren't pointing out that industry is booming as more and more uses are found for this new technology. Actually, people are being hired in droves. Sure, some people have lost jobs, often jobs they've held for a long time and that they treasure, but unemployment is actually dropping. We should also recognize that the burgeoning exports of her technology have recently given the U.S. a positive balance of trade for the first time in a long time.\"\n\nFlood interrupted, \"This discussion of the economy is interesting, but doesn't have much bearing on the question of whether or not we should be letting one person control our 'first contact' with other intelligent races out there.\"\n\nFladwami quietly but emphatically said, \"It is relevant if we piss off the goose that's been laying the golden eggs by trying to force her do something she feels is unethical.\"\n\nBlythe raised his eyebrows, \"Unethical? Why would she feel it's unethical?\"\n\nFladwami snorted, \"Speaking to me, she's likened giving that committee control of first contact, to handing a gun to a three year old.\"\n\nBlythe stared, \"But you don't give a gun to a psycho either! How can we leave said gun in the control of a single individual!\"\n\n\"You haven't met this individual have you?\"\n\n\"Well, no but... any individual might flake out.\"\n\n\"So can an entire committee, or even an entire country under the sway of a charismatic leader. Look at Nazi Germany. There are plenty of other examples.\"\n\nPresident Flood cleared his throat, \"I propose that we invite said young lady up for a discussion of the issues. I want to hear directly from her the rationale for not wanting a committee to be in charge and discuss other options she may feel are reasonable... Besides, I need to congratulate her before the nation for what she just did in the Olympics.\"\n\n\"You can say that again...\"\n\n***\n\n\"Ms. Donsaii, Ms. Donsaii!\" the reporter in the press pool waved his hand.\n\nEll acknowledged him.\n\n\"We're all aware that none of the medical or drug testing done on you has found any banned substances, but how do you explain your ability to perform at a level so much higher than even the world's most elite athletes,\" he shrugged, \"like those who have attended and competed at these Olympics?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't know.\" Ell grinned at him, \"I can assure you that I haven't found some magic, undetectable drug that lets me run fast. My parents were both very athletic, but so were the parents of many of the athletes at these Olympics. My leading hypothesis is that somehow my nervous and musculoskeletal systems, by the luck of the draw, have every one of their gene selections fall at the extreme end of choices that give up endurance for speed.\" She laughed, \"I assure you I'm a terrible endurance athlete. I'd never be chosen for anyone's long, or even their middle distance track team.\" She pointed to another reporter.\n\n\"How does it feel to have proven Michael Fentis wrong after all those times he said you couldn't actually have run that fast?\"\n\nEll gave a wistful look, \"Kinda sad, actually. Mr. Fentis is an amazing sprinter who rightfully took great pride in his accomplishments. I'm embarrassed and ashamed that I was petty and prideful enough to set out to prove him wrong.\"\n\nStartled glances among the reporters there showed just how few had anticipated that answer...\n\n***\n\nAn enormous crush of reporters and paparazzi waited outside the exits from the Track and Field facilities. Each had their own reasons for choosing the exit they believed that Donsaii would leave through, though some were members of teams that had multiple exits covered. Aware of her propensity to wear ball caps and hoodies to cover her signature strawberry blond hair, every light skinned person wearing such was subjected to intense scrutiny.\n\nNo one noticed the slender dark-skinned girl with the spiky black hair and beaky nose that slipped from one of the smaller exits and looked curiously around at the AV-equipped crowd. She crossed the street, hopping on a bus before it made its turn to head back out toward the hotels. Taking a seat, she leaned her head against the window and was gone.\n\nSalah boarded the bus away from the Olympic venues and nearly sat next to another man before he saw the girl. She had on a snug t-shirt and jeans. With a smile he slid into the seat next to her, \"Hello,\" he said, gazing at her breasts and noticing the odd design on the front of her shirt. It had a red circle with a slash through it, over a hand. \"What's the meaning of your shirt?\" he asked, sliding a hand down between their legs so it rested against her thigh. A nice firm thigh he noticed with some delight.\n\nHer hand followed his down between their legs and onto his hand. \"It means,\" she said, \"keep your hands to yourself.\" She grasped his index finger and started bending it backward,\n\nSalah reached over with his other hand and grabbed at her wrist, \"Hey! What are you doing?!\" The girl was astonishingly strong!\n\nDespite his grip she continued to turn his finger back until it really hurt. Trying to take the stress off of it, he slid off the seat and crouched to his knees.\n\nLooking at him with icy green eyes, she said, \"If I let go, will you keep your hands to yourself from now on?\"\n\n\"Achhh!\" Humiliated and embarrassed, Salah ground out, \"Yes! Yes!\"\n\nShe let go and he shook his hand out with some relief, but also growing anger. She'd brought it on herself, after all, dressing like a sleazy tart! Tight shirt and pants, spiky hair, colored contacts! How did she have the gall to disrespect him for acting in a fashion she'd as much as asked for? The bus bumped along, stopping here and there. Salah's temper rose. Inside he fumed with a desire for revenge. Then she taunted him by cheerfully, as if nothing had happened between them, getting up and saying, \"This is my stop.\"\n\nAs her legs separated to step past his knees into the aisle, Salah couldn't resist.\n\nHe shot his hand up between them...\n\nBefore his hand reached her crotch, something struck him in the cheek. People on the bus turned to stare at the whipcrack sound.\n\nSomething had hit him, hard! Salah at first thought another passenger had knocked into his head with some large piece of rigid luggage.\n\nBut then, leaving no doubt about who had delivered the blow, the girl leaned down and growled, \"I told you to keep your hands to yourself!\" Confused and woozy, Salah groped for the glasses which had flown off his face.\n\nPeople stared at Salah while the girl got off the bus without further incident. His equilibrium recovered, but he had a difficult time explaining his massively bruised face, black eye and broken glasses to his parents when he got home.\n\nChapter One\n\nDelhi, India—As the Track and Field events of these Olympics conclude, all that anyone can talk about is the complete destruction of the world records in the sprint distances by Ell Donsaii. She is now not just the women's record holder in the three sprint distances and the long jump, but she has broken the men's records as well. She has accomplished this astonishing feat without braggadocio, instead constantly praising her competitors for their accomplishments, no matter how meager those accomplishments now seem. People have begun asking, \"Could this woman perform at an unbelievable level in other sports if she wished?\"\n\nAs Ell walked the last part of the route to her hotel Allan said, \"You have a call from Dr. Kant Fladwami.\"\n\n\"Put him on... Dr. Fladwami, what can I do for you?\"\n\n\"The President has asked me to arrange a meeting. He'd like to both congratulate you on the Olympics and speak to you about alien contact. When will you be back here in the States?\"\n\n\"Um, I'm planning a little vacation over here before I return next week. Do you need me to call that off?\"\n\n\"No, no, that'd be fine. Could you come by the week after next?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n***\n\nThe door banged open and Ell bounded into the hotel room, dressed in her \"Ellen\" get up. \"Shan!\" she shouted gleefully, leaping onto the bed and throwing her arms around him.\n\n\"What held you up?\" Shan asked hugging her back.\n\n\"Coach Black caught me. Turns out I was supposed to be 'making myself available to the press' after my last event of each day of the Olympics rather than immediately sneaking off in disguise. So I sat for a press conference and answered a lot of predictable questions with predictable answers.\" She raised an eyebrow, \"But, now we can get out of here!\"\n\n\"Tired of India already?\"\n\n\"Yup. The men here are really crude. I got groped again today.\"\n\n\"Damn!\" Shan grimaced, feeling like he should have been there to protect her, though he suspected she could protect herself better than he could. \"Did he get another dose of your pepper spray?\"\n\nEll frowned, \"No, he caught me by surprise and I slapped him before I thought to spray him... I feel pretty bad about it.\"\n\nShan snorted, \"You think a slap was worse than being pepper sprayed?\"\n\nShe winced, \"Yeah. I hit him pretty hard.\"\n\nShan shrugged, still doubtful. Changing the subject he said, \"So where are we going?\"\n\n\"Where do you want to go? We've got four more days before we have to be in Venice to catch our plane back to the US.\"\n\n\"Greece?\"\n\n\"Oooohh! The islands?\"\n\nShan shrugged, \"Sure.\"\n\n\"Allan,\" Ell said to her AI (Artificial Intelligence), \"Check us out of this hotel. Tell the pilots we're on our way to the airport and want to fly to a Greek island.\"\n\n\"Which island?\" Allan asked.\n\n\"One with an airport. We don't care much which one. Tell them to surprise us.\" She turned to Shan, \"Is that OK with you?\"\n\nShan nodded.\n\n\"Steve,\" Ell said so that Allan would connect her to her security detail. \"We're heading to the airport. You guys ready enough that we could head downstairs now?\"\n\n***\n\nShan lifted his head off the sheets and peered out the window at the gleaming white buildings of Santorini. He stretched and got up, padding to the window. The sun, rising behind him, lit the scattered, brilliantly blue domes that topped some of the buildings. Straight out the window was an infinity pool, and beyond that the cliff dropped down into the caldera of the ancient Thera volcano on which Santorini perched. The sapphire waters of the Aegean filled the entire bowl of the volcano except for the small island, Nea Kameni, out in the middle.\n\nShaking his head over the beautiful scenery, he turned to head into the next room. Ell lay relaxed on the couch, studying a bizarre graph on the large wall screen. \"Hey girl, jetlag isn't kicking my ass so bad this time. Think I'm toughening up?\"\n\nShe smiled brilliantly up at him. \"Hey, yourself. The time zone only changed two hours, plus jetlag isn't as bad going west as it is going east. I suspect you're just as weak as you've always been.\"\n\nShan frowned, \"You know, your constant belittling of my jetlag tolerance is probably gonna turn me into a eunuch.\"\n\n\"Hah!\" She leapt up from the couch and took him by the hand, pulling him back toward the bedroom. Tossing him a crooked smile over her shoulder, she said, \"Well then, honeymoon boy, we'd better exercise your manhood while it's still functional.\"\n\n***\n\nEll lay, head on Shan's shoulder, running a finger gently over his chest. Shan said, \"So what did you have graphed on the screen in the other room?\"\n\n\"Oh I'm using Mathematica to display what we know about the conditions for formation of the various carbon allotropes. It just seems to me that a good graph would help us understand it better. If we understood it, we might be able to move away from following a recipe that the sigmas told us created a particular allotrope to being able to say, 'this particular set of conditions should optimally synthesize... say diamond.'\"\n\n\"Really? Can I look at that? The pattern you had up looks like a...\" He paused at her upraised hand.\n\nEll's eyes had widened before she put up her halting hand, \"Of course! Come in and look. I've been stymied! Don't tell me what pattern you're seeing; I don't want to influence you. I'll just tell you what's being graphed and then let you play with it while I make a breakfast to restore your strength.\"\n\nEll came back in the living room of their little villa carrying a small tray loaded with sliced toasted bagels slathered in butter. A tub of cream cheese was in her other hand. \"What do you think? Does it fit the pattern you thought it did?\"\n\nShan stared at the plate she had in her hands with widened eyes. \"Was once the day when, seeing that, I would have thought you'd invited some people over for breakfast... But, I'll bet you're planning to eat all but one of those bagels by yourself aren't you?\"\n\nEll blushed faintly, \"Hey, I have been getting a lot of exercise the past few days you know?\"\n\nShan barked a laugh, \"You know you'd eat all of that even if you hadn't just been kicking ass in the Olympics!\"\n\n\"Not so! I made myself an extra bagel 'cause of all that extra exercise.\"\n\nShan shook his head and picked up half a bagel. \"I should just be glad I'm not the one having to keep you in food.\" He scooped up some cream cheese and put a dollop on one side. He took a large bite and leaned back expansively, stretching his arms on the back of the couch and chewing contentedly.\n\n\"Hey!\" Ell poked him in the side. \"I made you these fine bagels; you can't just sit there chewing your cud. You owe me your thoughts on the graph.\"\n\nShan lifted a chin towards the wall screen, \"Read 'em and weep, my little lady. Read 'em and weep. Then I think you should put more cream cheese on my bagel, I'm kinda tired from all that work.\"\n\nEll's head snapped around and she focused on the screen. A three dimensional graph that looked somewhat like an undulating landscape had some of the sigma's specified conditions near some sharp peaks and other sigma specifications near some of the deep valleys. \"My God Shan,\" she hissed, \"That's gorgeous! I've been assuming that the sigma's specifications were optimal, but you're thinking I couldn't get them to fit because they aren't actually the best conditions, right? You think if we adjusted the conditions to fall on the peaks of this plot we'd get even better formation of those particular allotropes?\"\n\n\"That's what I think,\" he waved a negligent hand. \"However, I am but a humble theoretical mathematician. Merely a simple soul, schooled in the use of this modest computational engine.\"\n\nEll snorted, \"Humble!\" Picking up the tub of cream cheese she spread some on a bagel and, taking a big bite, dropped back against the couch to stare at the display. \"As soon as I finish this meager breakfast, I'm gonna have to take you out and demonstrate my admiration.\"\n\n\"I thought you just demonstrated that in the other room?\"\n\n***\n\nWhen Gary arrived at D5R in the morning, his AI told him he had a message from Ell that had arrived the night before. He was to pick up a PGR chip from Sheila that would link him directly to Ell's AI so she could send him a confidential message.\n\nSheila handed him the chip, telling him that Ell had said he should keep that particular chip for future restricted communications.\n\n\"OK,\" he replied, pulling off his headband and socketing the chip in place as he headed for one of the little conference rooms. He had initially planned to just go out into the main research room where he usually worked and watch it on his HUD. With all the cloak and dagger over the chip though, he decided he ought to watch it in a private room, at least 'til he knew what it was.\n\nOnce connected securely, Ell's AI delivered a brief recorded message in which Ell said, \"Gary, I've been working with Shan Kinrais from the Math Department at UNC to plot out the conditions for formation of the various allotropes. He's made a real breakthrough. See the attached graphic plot. We believe the plot diagrams the conditions where you will get the best formation of each different allotrope. Of note, please look at the two neighboring peaks at the upper right. You'll see that, in this region, conditions for graphene and diamond are very close to one another except for a small difference in temperature. If this works out to be true, we believe that you should be able to stitch layers of graphene together with tetrahedral diamond bonds. What we call 'graphend.' You just apply a bit more heat with a micro laser beam at each point where you want to bond the sheets to one another. Lots of cross bonds for a material that you want to be stiff in bending, very few bonds for materials loaded mostly in tension but that you don't want flaking apart.\"\n\nGary had opened the graph. His eye had immediately tracked to a graphene synthesis point that had conditions similar to what he was using to make graphene out at the space habitat. Could the conditions at the peak provide even cleaner or more rapid synthesis? Idly he wondered when Ell and Shan had found the time to collaborate. Ell had been competing in the Olympics and last he had heard Shan was on his honeymoon. Online he guessed.\n\nThen his brain caught up to what she'd said about stitching together layers of graphene and he felt prickles in his scalp...\n\n***\n\nShan walked out of the little kitchenette in their villa with a Zeos Pilsner in one hand. Ell stood at the window overlooking the caldera with her arms stretched out high and wide. He walked over and put his arms around her.\n\nTurning, she snuggled in to his embrace, tucking her head against his shoulder.\n\nShan thought that the moment was close to perfect. All seemed to be right with their world.\n\nAfter a moment she leaned her head back and said, \"Hey, feel like going to a deserted beach?\"\n\n\"Sure, but I already checked, the nice beaches on Santorini are all crowded.\"\n\n\"I was thinking maybe we'd go to one of the little deserted islands near here.\"\n\n\"Hah! Those islands look close on the map but they're actually fifteen to twenty miles from here. If we hired a local boat it'd take a couple hours to get there and a couple more to come back. I'm not sure it's worth it?\"\n\n\"Why don't we fly?\"\n\n\"Deserted islands don't have airports!\"\n\n\"Helicopter?\"\n\n\"Hmm, I know they have a chopper that takes people on tours of the island. Are you thinking we could charter it?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" Ell raised an eyebrow. \"But we could take the little ultralight quadcopter we brought in the Gulfstream.\"\n\nShan's eyes widened, \"What kind of helicopter would fit into that little jet?\"\n\nEll winked at him. \"A little one.\"\n\nAn hour later Shan found himself beside a fairly deserted road, holding a small backpack with five gyro sandwiches and two collapsible cups. Ell and Steve were arguing about whether it was safe for her to take the little helicopter up. Nearby were a couple of SUVs Steve had rented for the security team.\n\nShan stared at the device Ell had pulled out of one of the SUVs. It had been in five pieces which she had snapped together. However, even after assembly, Ell had carried the entire thing by herself suggesting it wasn't very heavy. Almost every part of it looked like it was made out of carbon fiber. It had a couple of large ducted fans, front and back, with smaller ones on each side, mounted a little closer to the back. She set it on its side, and snapped down three spindly little legs with wheels. The legs had all been folded up against the saddle which bridged from the front fan to the back one. Once she'd clicked the legs down, she flipped it up onto the wheels.\n\nThe whole time Ell worked on the copter, Steve kept up a constant harangue about how dangerous this was, how it was probably against Greek law and that he couldn't believe she would consider taking her new husband up in it. \"You told me,\" Steve said, \"that Shan wouldn't even approve of you flying these 'copters, much less taking him with you!\"\n\nEll turned to him, hands on her hips. \"Steve,\" she grinned, \"my mother doesn't nag this much! Take it as a given that I'm going to go somewhere on this chopper. Shan's a big boy, he can decide for himself whether he wants to go or not.\" She turned to Shan, \"I'm gonna take it up for a little ride to make sure everything's working. That way you can see how it works and decide if you want to go for a ride too, OK?\"\n\nShan nodded numbly. He'd always pictured himself as the daredevil of his family. He'd be the one who would have to talk his wife into doing exciting stuff. But a little helicopter she'd designed herself and that the guys in the D5R machine shop built for her? Could his new wife be completely out of her mind?\n\nEll went over to the SUV and pulled on some coverall type pants and a jacket then turned to Barrett, \"Toss me my brain bucket.\"\n\nBarrett actually handed her the helmet and she pulled it on, right over her HUD. She pushed the little 'copter around to the other side of the SUV so the spectators would be protected from any accident. Straddling the seat she twisted the throttle a little then lifted and pulled back on the handlebars while looking at the rotors in the front duct. There were two rotors inside the duct and they began slowly counter rotating. She gradually sped them up; apparently feeling for vibration which would suggest something was out of balance. Then she pushed the handlebars forward while looking back over her shoulder at the back fan. It spun up smoothly as well. Centering the handlebars front to back she lifted and all four fans spun up. The two side ducts had single rotors in them, turning clockwise on the right and counterclockwise on the left. She twisted the throttle a little more and air began blowing out much harder. The lightweight craft lifted off the ground before it had thrown up very much dust.\n\nStaying close to the ground, Ell flew it off about a hundred yards away, then lifted into the air about twenty feet. She made some little circles and figure eights, then flew back over closer to the SUV and landed. As the rotors spun down, she lifted her visor, grinned at Shan and said, \"You ready to go out to an island?\"\n\nShan looked over at Steve, \"have you tried this out?\"\n\nSteve rolled his eyes and shook his head.\n\nShan frowned at Ell, \"Are you sure it can lift both of us?\"\n\n\"Yup,\" she patted the frame. \"High strength carbon fiber. It'll be even lighter when we can make it out of graphend, but for now this is pretty good stuff. The motors back in my barn that're driving the fans put out a total of 500 horsepower so it's actually way overpowered.\"\n\n\"What happens if the rotors come apart, do we have 'chutes?\"\n\n\"If the rotors come apart our biggest problem would be shrapnel but that should be contained in the ducts. Fragments could fly out above or below the ducts, but that's one of the reasons there are screens top and bottom over the ducts, though the top ones also keep the fans from sucking stuff in. So, the rotor shouldn't hit us, but we would go down, so we won't fly very high. We'd fall right into the Aegean out there. Water's pretty warm, about 75oF so we'll be OK for quite a while. We'll just call Steve to rent a boat and come out after us.\"\n\n\"Do we wear life vests?\"\n\nEll slapped her jacket, \"This thing is flotation Kevlar so you ain't goin' down unless you take it off.\"\n\nShan looked over at Steve who shook his head in frustration, then back at Ell who beamed unrepentantly.\n\nShe said, \"You gonna be a fuddy duddy, or you gonna climb on the bitch seat and live a little?\"\n\nShan shook his head woefully, \"I'll bet I'm gonna regret this. You got a helmet and Kevlar suit for me?\"\n\nEll pointed at the SUV, but when Shan turned Barrett was already standing behind him with a helmet and suit his size. A few minutes after that Shan was sitting on the back seat behind Ell. There were a couple of hand grips and Ell's slender waist to hold onto. \"What, no seat belt?\"\n\n\"I thought about it, but it seems like you'd want to be able to bail out. Motorcycles don't have seat belts either. So grab hold and let's go for a ride.\" She turned her head and leaned back to look at him, \"Or you could sit this one out.\" She reached out and adjusted the mounting for the handlebars so they weren't so close to her.\n\nShan sighed, \"Have you ever flown this thing before today?\"\n\n\"Flew version one, which was more like a helicopter, about twenty times. This quadcopter version is number two. I've been up in it a couple times before that little run I just made to check it out.\" Excitedly she started pointing out its features. \"The front and rear ducted fans counter rotate to eliminate gyroscopic effects and each duct has a 175 horsepower engine powering the fans through ports. The two smaller 75 horse ducts pivot.\" She pushed and pulled on the handlebars to show them pivoting front to back. When they're straight down they help lift and tilt us side to side. Pivot them back and they push us forward so we can fly faster than a typical helicopter. Pivot them forward and they become our brakes to slow us down. The 'copter has a pretty high powered AI controlling all the fans so if I pass out and let go of the handlebars it will just slowly lower itself down to the ground and land in an empty space. Driving it is pretty easy. The twist throttle supplies a general level of power. Lift the handlebars and it goes up. Lower them and it drops. Turn them left or right to go those directions, and tilt them to 'bank' it. Push the handlebars forward to go forward and pull them back to slow down or reverse. The AI controls it all by speeding and slowing the fans and pivoting the two side ducts.\n\n\"Oh hell,\" Shan sighed, \"I guess I can't drag this out any longer. Take me up and let's check out the beaches.\"\n\n\"You've got a ported snorkel in that zippered upper left front pocket... just in case we fall in the water.\" The rotors started spinning up as Shan closed his visor. When the wheels got light Ell pushed on the handlebars to tilt the 'copter slightly forward. With a little more lift on the handlebars the hoverbike lifted off the ground and began skimming forward, over the road, across the beach, and out towards the Aegean.\n\nEll lifted them a little higher and they sailed out over the tops of the waves at an altitude of about five feet.\n\nShan found it breathtaking, a lot like his first ride on a motorcycle. But better!\n\nOnce he felt comfortable, Ell lifted to about ten feet and made some exhilarating \"S\" turns, then turned up the speed as they headed northeast from Santorini. Despite the wind noise outside, with his HUD inside the helmet and noise cancellation from his AI he could still talk to Ell fairly easily. \"How do we find an island out here?\"\n\n\"Well, Allan's leading me to Anydros by GPS but...\" she lifted the handlebars and they rose to about thirty feet where they could easily see a little island that had actually just been coming up over the horizon. \"There it is.\" Then she dropped back down to just above the water.\n\nSkimming along just above the water made it seem like they were going a lot faster. \"How fast are we going?\" Shan asked.\n\n\"Only about eighty. We could go faster, but even if we crash at this speed, those soft looking waves are gonna hit us pretty hard. It isn't that far, so we should be there in about ten more minutes at this speed.\"\n\nAs they arrived at Anydros, Ell curved around the south end and swept up the eastern coast of the mile long island. She turned in at a small cove with a beach on the far side and coasted in for a landing just beyond the sand. Flipping up her visor, she turned to Shan, eyes dancing. \"Was that great or what?\" She leapt off the seat and pulled off her helmet and her \"Raquel\" wig.\n\nShan dismounted and pulled off his helmet too, unable to keep the delight out of his eyes. \"Yeah! That was great! When do I get to fly it?\"\n\nPeeling off her Kevlar suit Ell said, \"Hmm, the first time, I think you should fly it from the back seat with your arms around me. That way I can help if you start getting out of control.\" She lifted an eyebrow, \"I like having your arms around me.\" She started unbuttoning her shirt.\n\nThinking that she'd have a bikini under her clothes, Shan's eyes widened when he saw she didn't. \"No swim suit?\"\n\nEll raised her eyebrows, \"Who needs a suit? This island is deserted! She plucked her snorkel and some goggles out of the pocket on her Kevlar suit, then loped gracefully across the sand into the waves.\n\nShan stared admiringly after her for a moment, then started digging for his own snorkel.\n\nAfter playing in the waves a while and snorkeling under them to look at the sea life, they walked back out of the sea. Ell spun joyously around, swinging her arms and laughing. \"This is beautiful!\"\n\nShan nodded, \"You are indeed.\"\n\n\"No, you doofus,\" Ell beamed at him, \"I meant the island and the sea and the beach and being alone on it with you.\"\n\n\"Well, that too.\" Shan grinned at her. \"I'm feeling hungry; how 'bout we get around those gyros you put in my backpack?\"\n\n\"Great idea!\" Ell said, patting her flat stomach and turning to trot that way.\n\nShan dug out the sandwiches and the two collapsible cups, then felt around in the empty backpack. \"Hey, did you put in any drinks? All that's in this backpack are the gyros and a couple of empty cups.\"\n\nShe patted his stomach, \"Maybe we need to drink some of this here six-pack?'\n\nShan snorted, \"We could get pretty thirsty out here with nothin' but saltwater for 20 miles.\"\n\nShe held out her hand, \"Well, let me see one of those cups.\"\n\nShan handed her one of the collapsible cups and she popped it open and turned her back to him. He stared, wondering what she thought she was doing, but then he heard the distinctive sound of beer pouring. She's naked! Where is beer coming from? Shan peered over her shoulder to see beer pouring into the cup from a spot in space about two inches in front of her belly button. It stopped for a moment, then resumed pouring from a spot just closer to her than it had been coming from, then paused again and began pouring from a little farther away. He snorted, \"You're using that single-ended port you put behind your belly button—for beer?\"\n\nEll grinned at him, \"Don't you go acting all hoity-toity on me. I might just pour this beer of yours out in the sand.\"\n\n\"Who's pouring that beer in there for you? It must be what, six in the morning back in North Carolina?\"\n\n\"Yep, you're gonna need to thank Amy for gettin' up so early, just to satisfy your thirst for alcoholic beverages.\"\n\n\"Hah! You're not going to have her pour you a drink?\"\n\n\"Well, of course. As long as she's already had to get up to pour one for you, pouring one for me too doesn't seem like too much additional trouble does it?\"\n\nShan laughed.\n\nShe held his beer out to him and plucked the other cup out of his hand. A moment later Coke started pouring into her cup.\n\nThey sat peacefully on a large smooth boulder at the water's edge. Waves lapped at their feet while they ate their gyros. Shan sipped at his beer, looking out over the sea, glancing at the beautiful woman at his side. He thought about how, if someone had told him a few years earlier he might be doing this today, he would never have believed.\n\nEll turned to him and said, \"You ready to try flying our little hoverbike yourself?\"\n\n\"Yeah!\"\n\nEll used her port to fill their cups with fresh water several times so they could splash the salt water off. Once the sun had dried them off, they put their clothes on and packed their trash back in the backpack. Shan straddled the hoverbike and Ell got on in front of him. Ell said, \"I suggest you spool up the fans, staying short of where they'd lift us off. Then try moving the handlebars around to get the feel of what they do. In flight the AI should keep you from flipping the bike over or doing anything really dumb, but if you want to feel like you're flying it, it's good to have an idea what's going to happen when you do things with the controller.\"\n\nShan twisted the throttle grip a little and checked to make sure all the fans were turning. Tilting the handlebars side to side made the bike strain to tilt against its wheels. He pulled back and pushed forward and then leveled it. He lifted the handle bars to hear the fans all spin up, straining to lift off but unable to rise at the low throttle setting.\n\n\"All right, give it a little more throttle. \"\n\nShan did and it lifted smoothly off the ground. \"I didn't think it would be so steady.\"\n\n\"Trust me,\" Ell laughed, \"without the AI, it wouldn't be. Give it more throttle, but lower the handlebars. It'll be even steadier with lots of power available, but the AI reducing the power because the handlebars indicate you aren't trying to lift very high.\"\n\nShan gradually gave it more throttle while lowering the bars to keep the hoverbike about three to five feet off the ground.\n\n\"All right, take it down into the cove and let's have you practice some circles and figure eights.\"\n\n\"Why not right here?\" Shan asked, though he did start skimming the hoverbike down across the beach to the water.\n\n\"If you wreck it here, you'll land on something hard. I'd rather we bashed our delicate heads on the water.\"\n\nOut over the water, Ell had Shan practice banking to match the tightness of his turns so bike didn't skid around the curves. For amusement, he did make a couple of turns without banking at all which—as long as he didn't push forward on the handlebars and activate the pusher fans on the sides—had the effect of simply spinning the hoverbike while it continued coasting mostly in the same direction.\n\n\"That was fun!\" Shan laughed after a while. \"Shall we head back to Santorini?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\nShan curved out and around the south end of the island, turning toward Santorini. \"What the hell is that?\"\n\nA cloud of dirty yellow brown smoke hung over the island.\n\n\"Allan,\" Ell said, \"What's happened at Santorini?\"\n\n\"There has been a small eruption of the Thera volcano at Santorini with new lava flows emanating from the Nea Kameni island in the middle of the caldera. At present it does not appear to threaten the surrounding caldera islands. The only danger at present appears to be to a group of tourists who were hiking the small crater on Nea Kameni. They have been trapped between a pair of lava flows. Tour helicopters are attempting to pick them up at present, but there is not sufficient space for the helicopters to land.\"\n\n\"Oh my God!\" Ell exclaimed, taking the controls. \"Let's see if we can help!\" She cranked the throttle grip wide open and smoothly pushed the handlebars forward and slightly up. As they leaned forward to decrease wind resistance, the hoverbike rose to about twenty feet and rocketed forward, quickly reaching two hundred miles per hour. At that speed they reached Santorini in about six minutes, Ell lifting the handlebars so that they rose over the northeastern rim of the caldera. Once they crossed the rim she dropped down toward the little island out in the middle of the huge caldera. Clouds of sulfurous smoke were billowing out of the crater in its center. Saying to Shan, \"Use your snorkel!\" Ell fumbled hers out of her pocket and up into the helmet.\n\nThey slid in over the island. East of the little crater at the center of Nea Kameni they could see about twenty people isolated between a couple of lava flows. A helicopter hovered over them, but because of the slope it couldn't get close enough for any of the people to actually board it. Finally, while Ell and Shan watched, a man leapt up and grabbed one of the landing skids. The small helicopter sank for a moment under his added weight but then lifted back up and carried him to safety about a hundred yards away. They'd saved one, but it was very obvious that only individuals with a high level of physical fitness could be rescued in that manner.\n\nOnce the helicopter set the man down, it pulled away and flew toward the main island, presumably to get a rescue sling.\n\nEll swung off to one side and brought the hoverbike down on a fairly flat area. She hopped off and turned away from the trapped people. Suddenly an eight foot length of 1\" nylon rope shot out from just in front of her abdomen. She grabbed the front end, but let the trailing end fall. Then another and another shot out, until she had five ropes. Then a small bundle of black thread popped out. She tied loops into the five pieces of rope, then wrapped one end of the thread around the knots so that all five loops formed a bundle at the knots. The other end of the black thread she tied around the saddle of the hoverbike. Shan had been watching the people trapped in the lava flow, trying to think of a solution for rescuing them. He looked down at what she was doing. Opening his mouth to speak clumsily around the snorkel he asked, \"What's that for?\"\n\n\"It's one of Gary's graphene cables. The only way I could get a hundred yards of cable through the port during the three seconds a one way port will stay open. You're going to fly the hoverbike straight up and lift me over to get some of those people. I'll give you directions.\"\n\nStaring wide eyed at the heavy thread she'd tied to the hoverbike, Shan said, \"I know graphene's strong, but that stuff isn't even a millimeter in diameter!\"\n\n\"Ten thousand pound test. It won't be our failure point... I'm going to run out to the side to pull the graphene cable out straight. If a loop of it were to get sucked into the intake of the hoverbike's fans, that would be a disaster.\" She picked up the five loops of rope and trotted away.\n\nShan's eyebrows rose while he imagined what would happen to the fans if ten thousand pound test thread got wound into them. He glanced back over at the trapped people. One of them was throwing up, whether from anxiety or from the sulfurous fumes Shan didn't know. Shan looked back at Ell, \"Shouldn't you be flying this while I give you guidance in dangling the ropes to them? You've got the flying experience.\"\n\n\"You'll do fine. The AI'll help. I'm going to ride over to them on the cable, then help them get into the ropes. My gymnastics might come in handy...OK,\" Ell said, tugging on the cable, \"take the bike up slow.\"\n\nShan gently twisted the throttle and lifted the bars. The bike lifted slowly and Ell started walking back toward him as the cable started reeling her in.\n\n\"You can go up a little faster... OK, slow now.\" Ell pulled one of the one inch rope loops over her head and put her arms out over it so it went behind her back and came out under her armpits in front. She bent her knees and a moment later the cable lifted her and the other loops off the ground. Shan wasn't going perfectly straight up so she dragged her feet to keep from swinging like a pendulum. \"OK, I'm off the ground. Lift a little more and move south toward the people... OK, slow, slower, reverse a little. Drop down five feet now.\"\n\nShrinking away from the heat of the lava, Aki Nishikawa blinked his watering eyes and coughed as he watched the bizarre craft land. It looked a little like a big motorcycle with huge front and back wheels turned on their sides. Or like a saddle suspended between two Frisbees. One of the riders hopped off and began fooling around with some ropes. Aki looked back toward the caldera islands, hoping to see a real helicopter coming back. When he turned back to look at the Frisbee craft again, it had lifted into the air and the man who'd gotten off was quite a ways away from it, still holding his ropes. A moment later he began trotting back toward where the Frisbee craft had been sitting. Aki wondered why the man had gotten off, but then the guy just lifted off the ground.\n\nAki blinked vigorously but couldn't see how the guy could be flying up into the air like that. Glancing up, he saw the Frisbee craft straight up above him, as if it were pulling the guy up, but there wasn't anything connecting the craft to the man. The guy had on a motorcycle helmet and suit and one of the ropes looped under one arm behind his back and back up under the other armpit. The rope was tight and appeared to be lifting him, but whatever was lifting the rope wasn't in evidence. It did seem to point up toward the hovering Frisbee craft though. The guy was swinging toward Aki's group! Could this be a rescue attempt? It looked like the guy might swing right by and Aki reached out to catch him.\n\nThen he started to drop.\n\n_Chikushō_! He's going to land in the lava!\n\nInstead the guy reached up overhead, grasped the ropes as high as he could reach and kipped up in an amazing gymnastic display, turning upside down to lift his feet up and over the lava. He righted himself and dropped nimbly back to the ground right next to Aki.\n\nAki grabbed at the guy to steady him, but he didn't seem to need it.\n\nA girl's muffled voice issued from the helmet! \"OK, drop a couple of feet to loosen the cable then hold steady there. Allan's going to have the hoverbike's AI help you maintain that position using GPS.\" The young woman in the motorcycle garb flipped up her visor, reached in the opening to take a mouthpiece out of her mouth, and then shouted out at the tour group, \"OK! We can fly you to safety four at a time. Step up and loop your arms in the ropes like I have mine. We'll come back for more.\"\n\nNo one answered because few understood. Aki translated the woman's English into Japanese for the group and several stepped forward. A mother held out her crying child to the woman. The kid only looked to be about three to four years old. The young woman appeared to be startled, but did take the little girl from her mother. She asked Aki to have the four people who'd taken ropes stand back to back with her.\n\nCoughing some more, Aki desperately wanted to take a rope for himself but decided that the women should go first. Besides, I should stay to translate. He swallowed as the ropes came tight on the group. He could hear the whine of fans above where the Frisbee craft hung above them and even though it was fifty meters up he could see the sulfurous fumes blowing away from its downdraft. The girl and the four people lifted slowly into the air, still without Aki being able to see what was attaching them to the hoverbike or otherwise could be lifting them. They swung across the lava flow and over to what looked like a safe area about a hundred and fifty meters away. The people dropped out of their ropes and one of them took the child from the young woman.\n\nMoments later the young woman rose back off the ground and swung back over to Aki's group. Landing again she flipped up her visor and shouted, \"Ready for four more!\"\n\nAs Aki looked on, the woman made three more trips back and forth, ferrying four people each trip. Finally Aki and two others were all that was left. As the young woman landed to pick them up, the fumes overcame the old man standing next to Aki. As the fellow began to collapse he staggered toward the lava flow. Aki reached out, knowing he would be too late. The old man is going to be horribly burned!\n\nInstead, the girl in the motorcycle helmet leapt after the old man.

The assassin was dead.\n\nSo did anyone really give a rat's aft if someone else may have been involved in the killing of Caesar?\n\nEven if that _someone_ might have been Caesar's own son?\n\nEven if that son had assumed the role of the new Caesar?\n\nEither the thought of a patricide leading an interstellar empire did not horribly unsettle the Senate and People of Rome or else denial simply served them better, because the Senate did not challenge the legitimacy of the new Caesar, and the People loved him.\n\nSuspicion was after all only suspicion.\n\nOther than possibly murdering his own father, the new Caesar was a damn fine Caesar.\n\nIn his very new reign, young Caesar Romulus had already beaten down the monstrous Hive threat to a shred of its former terror. Only a whimpering presence of Hive remained deep in the Deep End of the galaxy. Hundreds of light-years and many American settlements stood between the remains of the Hive and the nearest Roman target. It would be a long, long time before the Hive threatened a Roman outpost again.\n\nCaesar Romulus summoned home all Roman forces that were serving under U.S. command. Let the Americans deal with what remained of the Hive. It was no longer a Roman concern.\n\nCaesar Romulus renounced Rome's surrender to the United States.\n\nCaesar Romulus expelled the Americans from the Roman planet Thaleia, and reinstalled Thaleia's orbiting sentinels. He staged a spectacular bombing of the Triumphal Arch which his father, Caesar Magnus, had constructed on Thaleia in honor of the American John Farragut, Captain of the U.S. space battleship _Merrimack_.\n\nOn the Roman capital world of Palatine, Caesar Romulus redesigned the Monument to the Conciliation. The original monument featured an enormous golden eagle soaring wingtip to wingtip with a bald eagle, like two great powers flying in perfect accord.\n\nIn Romulus' reworked monument, the bald eagle cowered on its back under the claws of the diving golden eagle. \"Here,\" said Romulus, \"let all humanity know that the Conciliation was a fraud. Here is what Rome really thinks of Pax Americana.\"\n\nOn an interstellar broadcast, for all the known region of the galaxy to witness, Caesar Romulus broke the spears of Subjugation under his own heel.\n\nFor that alone, many Romans called for Romulus' deification.\n\nToo savvy a politician to accept divine honors, Romulus expressed gratitude at the depth of his People's regard, but said, \"You cannot vote someone to godhood.\" And that only increased his popularity.\n\nRomulus could do no wrong.\n\nMagnus had already done it all.\n\nBack in the desperate days when the Hive decimated Rome's mighty legions, desperation led Caesar Magnus to surrender to the United States. The surviving remnants of the Roman armed forces were placed under U.S. command.\n\nWith Rome's second worst enemy engaged against Rome's most pressing threat, Rome found a chance to rebuild its shattered forces in secret.\n\nWhile the U.S. carried the greater weight of the common defense against the Hive, Romulus organized the rebuilding of Rome's armed forces on the empire's most distant worlds that lay in the opposite direction from the Hive incursion. He'd started that even before the assassination of Caesar Magnus.\n\nUpon declaration of victory against the Hive, Romulus, now Caesar, unveiled his empire's new battleships.\n\nHe paraded his new legions up the Via Triumphalis on Palatine. The legions were very new. Many of the legionaries' voices had not changed yet. They were full of youthful fire, rabid to reclaim Rome's crushed pride, eager and ruthless as only children could be.\n\nLost on the proud new warriors was that Rome could not have achieved all this had Magnus not surrendered Rome to the U.S. No one would thank him for it.\n\nRomulus had also organized the manufacture of a new generation of killer bots. Automated factories on far worlds in the Perseid arm of the galaxy had been churning out killer bots by the hundred thousand per earthly month.\n\nThe Americans never suspected it was happening. Automated weapons were worse than useless against the Hive. Machine minds could be turned against their makers. There was no reason to think Rome could be rebuilding its fleets of killer bots.\n\nRomulus had been looking to the future.\n\nBecause of his foresight, Romulus' empire could face the Americans from a position of power, not subservience, when the common enemy collapsed.\n\nThere were vicious jealous whispers that Romulus had killed his father.\n\nWell, he hadn't. There was a recording of the event. Everyone saw the deed. That was not Romulus' hand you saw holding the pen that plunged into Caesar's eye. Whispers said Romulus drove the assassin to it. But no true Roman needed any pushing to kill Magnus.\n\nThere was scarcely a citizen in Rome's interstellar empire willing to look too closely for bones in the closet of a Caesar who accomplished everything Romulus had done for them.\n\nBut there was one. A Roman who could not allow Magnus Caesar's death to go unavenged for any reason.\n\nHe was programmed not to.\n\nMagnus' patterner had a deeply encoded imperative to defend Rome to his last breath and beyond that. To the patterner, Caesar was Rome. And Magnus was his Caesar.\n\nPatterners were dangerous creations, short-lived and difficult. Difficult to create, difficult to maintain, tricky to control. It was dangerous to put that much power into a thing with a mostly human brain.\n\nOnly nine of them had ever been successfully assembled.\n\nCaesar Romulus did not know it, but the last patterner was still alive.\n\nThe patterner Augustus had belonged to Caesar Magnus.\n\nAugustus was out there. And he did not suspect Romulus of involvement in his father's murder.\n\nHe _knew_.\nPART ONE\n\n**Off the Deep End**\n\n_If anything's gonna happen, it'll happen on the Hamster watch._\n\n—proverb on board _Merrimack_\n**1**\n\nLIEUTENANT GLENN (HAMSTER) HAMILTON was Officer of the Watch when the Emergency Action Message came in.\n\nShe passed the EAM to the cryptotech for confirmation, and immediately paged John Farragut on his personal com. \"Captain's presence requested on the command deck.\"\n\nCaptain Farragut's voice came back, \"What's this about?\"\n\nAn instant's blank panic showed on Hamster's face. The captain was often in Roman company. Hamster could not afford to explain. She answered quickly, \"Gypsy's hair.\" And immediately clicked off.\n\nShe stood over the com, feeling the eyes of the command deck upon her. With her eyes set dead ahead, she spoke to anyone in range of her quiet voice, \"If what I just said gets back to Commander Dent, every man jack and jane on this deck will walk the plank.\" And she took the com back up, \"Commander Dent, your presence is requested on the command deck.\"\n\nThe lieutenant had not requested speed from either the captain or the exec. She did not want to sound alarmed.\n\nAnd the captain was going to arrive like a missile anyway.\n\nJohn Farragut blew through the hatch to the command deck like a gust of fair wind, wearing the sky blue uniform of ship's captain.\n\nOne of the Marine guards at the hatch announced, \"Captain on deck.\"\n\nFarragut's presence announced itself. He was a big man, fair-haired, blue-eyed, an irresistible force. Energy radiated from him. Nearly forty years old now, he kept the bright enthusiasm of a boy.\n\nCaptain John Farragut had lately been Commodore Farragut, but that had been a field promotion and temporary. His Attack Group One had disbanded after fulfilling its purpose. The two League of Earth Nations ships of the Attack Group had stayed behind at Planet Zero. The U.S. ships _Rio Grande_ and _Wolfhound_ were headed back to Fort Eisenhower. And the two Roman ships _Gladiator_ and _Horatius_ that had been under Farragut's command separated out on orders from Caesar Romulus.\n\nThe space battleship _Merrimack_ remained alone in very deep space, in orbit around the dead world Telecore.\n\nTelecore had begun life as a Roman colony. Before anyone had ever heard of the Hive, the Romans built a secret outpost on the planet to outflank American expansion in the Sagittarian arm of the galaxy.\n\nTelecore had ended life consumed by the Hive. The Hive was a great soulless evil that existed only to eat. What the Romans planted on Telecore, the Hive came to reap.\n\nThe Romans were gone. The Hive was still there.\n\nCaptain Farragut liked to know his enemy. He had been in _Merrimack_ 's lab with the xenoscientists, observing how newly emerged gorgons behaved, when he received Hamster's summons.\n\nFarragut spoke before anyone could tell him, \"The balloon went up?\"\n\nSpecialists at their close-packed stations on the command deck traded looks. Somehow, from what Hamster said, John Farragut had figured out that the United States was at war.\n\n\"Looks like it, sir.\" Lieutenant Glenn Hamilton nodded toward the forward communications shack, where the cryptotech had cloistered himself with the EAM. \"Waiting on confirmation.\"\n\nCommander Egypt \"Gypsy\" Dent entered the deck. She had left her ferocious hair in her cabin. Her head was smooth. Her brown eyes were narrowed into a squint, half-asleep. Strong-boned, tall and frowning, Gypsy scanned the monitors for some sign of the emergency that had roused her here. Hamster advised her softly, \"It's war, sir.\"\n\nThe eyes opened at once. Gypsy was awake now.\n\n\"Who declared?\" said Farragut. \"I'm fixin' to be almighty unhappy if it was us.\"\n\nHe could not believe the Joint Chiefs would strand him out here in the deepest end of the Deep End, sitting on the biggest warship in the U.S. Naval Fleet, while the U.S. declared war without so much as a stand-by-for-heavy-rolls to warn him.\n\nBut Hamster answered, \" _They_ did, sir.\"\n\n_They_. Rome.\n\nThe Imperial Government of Rome establishes the following facts:\n\nAlthough Rome on her part has strictly adhered to the rules of international law in her relations with the United States during every period of the recent Emergency in the common defense against the Hive, the Government of the United States has used the Emergency to abridge the right of Rome to its own government, and continues to usurp the lawful authority of Rome over her own armed forces under pretext of a common defense against a threat that has been diminished to inconsequence in order to perpetuate oppression and to enforce a treaty coerced under most extreme circumstances. The United States violates Roman borders at will, and denies Rome the autonomy and security to which every nation is entitled, in actions more consistent with an organized crime racket rather than a civilized nation.\n\nPledges extracted upon threat of being fed to monsters cannot be bound by law.\n\nThe Government of the United States has thereby virtually created a state of war.\n\nThe Imperial Government of Rome, consequently, discontinues diplomatic relations with the United States of America and declares that Rome considers herself as being in a state of war with the United States of America.\n\nVIII.xiii.MMCDXLVI\n\nCAESAR ROMULUS.\n\n\"And you are all rotten people and don't deserve to live no more,\" Tactical added in a low mutter into his console.\n\n\"Thank you, Mister Vincent,\" said Farragut, a warning in his voice.\n\nLoose comments were what got Marcander Vincent bucked down to the Hamster Watch in the first place.\n\nFarragut asked Lieutenant Hamilton, \"Where do we stand?\"\n\n\"We have the text of the President's request to Congress to declare back at 'em,\" said Hamster, and fed the text to his station.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n\nOn the morning of August 13, the Imperial Government of Palatine, pursuant to its course of galactic conquest, declared war against the United States.\n\nThe long known and the long expected has thus taken place. The forces endeavoring to enslave the entire galaxy now are moving into free space.\n\nDelay invites greater danger. Rapid and united effort by all free peoples who are determined to remain free will insure a victory of the forces of justice and of righteousness over the forces of inhumanity and of totalitarianism.\n\nI, therefore, request the Congress to recognize a state of war between the United States and the Imperial Government of Palatine.\n\nMARISSA JANE JOHNSON.\n\n\"Congressional recognition is 'imminent,' \" Hamster added.\n\nFarragut looked to the com tech, \"Nothing from Congress yet?\"\n\n\"Not yet, sir.\"\n\n\" 'kay.\" Farragut drew alongside Commander Dent, his hand between her shoulder blades. He spoke low, \"If approval comes in before I get back, keep it quiet. There's something I have to do first.\"\n\n\"Understood, sir.\" Their heads were close together. Gypsy's brown eyes flicked, her focus shifting across his face, assessing.\n\nThere was a time, during the last hostilities, when Farragut had standing orders: Should _Merrimack_ ever fall into enemy hands, Captain Farragut must kill his cryptotech. During that time, _Merrimack_ had in fact been captured by Romans. Yet the cryptotech, Qord Johnson, was still alive to this day and authenticating the EAM in _Merrimack_ 's communication shack right now.\n\nSomeone _else_ had orders regarding the cryptotech in case of capture now.\n\nYou never could trust John Farragut to kill his own people.\n\nFarragut still had his orders regarding the Roman patterner, whom _Merrimack_ carried on board.\n\nIn case of war, the captain's first task—to be carried out immediately and without question—was to take Augustus down. The Roman patterner was the single biggest threat to U.S. security. Farragut's order was clear. Neutralize the threat. Do not try to capture Augustus or to salvage information from him. As Admiral Mishindi said, \"Just drop him.\"\n\nQord Johnson emerged from the communications shack. He looked to the captain, the XO. \"Sir. Sir.\" He passed the EAM to Farragut. \"Emergency Action Message confirmed. Rome declared war. President Johnson presented her declaration to Congress.\"\n\nThen it was real. War.\n\nGypsy studied the captain's eyes. She asked quietly, \"Do you want me to do it, sir?\"\n\nFarragut shook his head. \"If Augustus hears anyone but me coming to visit him, he'll know something's up.\"\n\nThat was true. Normally the crew and Marines on board _Merrimack_ went out of their way to avoid crossing Augustus' path.\n\nMost men on board would _like_ to have these orders.\n\nCaptain Farragut could not ever delegate something like this. The day he delegated because he could not carry out an order for himself was the day he delegated command of his ship.\n\nHe motioned to one of the Marines who flanked the hatch. \"Do you have a single stage piece on you?\"\n\nThe sergeant fished a small backup weapon from his boot pocket. Surrendered it, grip first.\n\nFarragut checked the load. Head busters. Low velocity projectiles, only meant to pierce a human body, not tear through and through. The point detonated only upon abrupt contact with human DNA.\n\nThe sergeant reminded Farragut uneasily, \"That piece is coded to me, sir.\" He felt stupid saying that to the captain. Would feel stupider if he hung the captain out there pulling the trigger of a gun that wouldn't fire for him.\n\nWeapons on board a space battleship were coded to their proper users. A weapon would not fire for anyone other than its coded owner.\n\nBut everyone on board _Merrimack_ , company and crew alike, belonged to Captain John Farragut.\n\nFarragut assured the Marine benevolently, \"Son, there's nothing on this boat I can't shoot.\"\n\nEven so, he depressed the trigger halfway. A green light confirmed recognition. He let up the trigger, clicked the safety off, cocked the piece, and slipped it into his jacket pocket like a street thug.\n\n\"Do you want a Marine guard?\" his XO asked.\n\nFarragut shook his head, no. \"Gypsy, he can hear a gnat spit.\"\n\n\"He'll hear _you_ ,\" said Gypsy.\n\n\"Good bet,\" Farragut agreed. \"He'll hear me coming. But that's okay. He likes to pretend I don't exist.\"\n\nAugustus never stood up when the captain entered his compartment. Most times Augustus did not even bother to look at him at all.\n\n\"I'll be right back.\"\n\nFarragut moved out fast. He did not try to soften his footsteps. He needed to sound normal.\n\nThis task had to be done. He saw the wisdom and necessity of it. And he knew how to kill—and not just at a distance. Farragut had beheaded the Roman Captain Sejanus on the command deck of his own ship with a sword. He knew how to do this.\n\nThis was just another Roman.\n\nThe most abrasive, off-pissing, caustic, sadistic son of a Roman bitch he had ever known.\n\nThe most loyal. With a courage beyond question.\n\nHe was having a son of a hard time with this one.\n\nFarragut would get only one shot, if that. He would not be able to say anything. No regrets. No good-bye. He could not even look him in the eyes. Augustus could read Farragut's eyes. And Augustus was extremely fast.\n\nNo one outdraws a patterner.\n\nJust shoot him. A shot in the back if Augustus' back presented first.\n\nA prickle like fear stung his mouth. He tried to blank out his thoughts. Stop thinking and just move.\n\nSounds of his ship around him were all normal. Booted footsteps on eight decks. Voices through thin partitions—fewer voices at this hour of the mid watch. The steady low hum of six mammoth engines. The sharp thunk of rubber balls in the squash court. Air rushing in the vents. Water moving through conduits. Hiss of hydraulics. Clicking of a dog that needed its nails cut.\n\nHis ship was an industrial beauty. Spare. Utilitarian. Thin partitions were only in place to keep things from passing compartment to compartment. Any equipment that might be tucked within walls on a passenger ship—conduits, pipes, struts—was all on view here. There were no ceilings, only the undersides of the upper decks along with more of the ship's inner workings clustered up there in the overhead. You could see what this ship was made of. Except for things dangerous, secret, private, or requiring heavy containment, _Merrimack_ was right there for you to see.\n\nFarragut slid down the ladder to the corridor that accessed the torpedo rack room. At six foot eight in height, Augustus was difficult to billet. A torpedo rack was the only place he could fit horizontally.\n\nFarragut made a conscious effort not to slow his stride. He wondered if Augustus could read deadly intent in a man's footsteps.\n\nHe hoped Augustus would not look when the hatch opened. He couldn't remember a time when Augustus ever did look. Augustus' pattern of disdain for Farragut's authority would serve now.\n\nThe patterner slept most of the day and all the mid watch. There was a good chance Farragut would catch him sleeping. He was probably going to murder Augustus in his rack.\n\nFarragut kept his right hand in his pocket, gripping the sidearm.\n\nDon't even show the piece, he decided. Just point and shoot through his pocket. The interior space beyond the hatch was tight. The instant that hatch opened, Farragut would be very close to his target. Point-blank, in fact.\n\nHis throat tightened up as he neared the hatch. He fought off the personal reaction. _To hell with it_.\n\nBig breath. Hold it.\n\nHis left arm was supposed to be reaching to pull the hatch open, but he suddenly could not move it.\n\nHe hadn't heard a thing.\n\nTwo invincible, cable-reinforced arms had locked around him from behind, pinning his left arm across his chest, his right arm locked against his side. A large hand closed over Farragut's right hand, the one gripping the sidearm inside his pocket.\n\nSqueezed.\n\nThe weapon discharged.\n\nThe bullet lodged in Farragut's deck boot. The head did not detonate.\n\nThe shot itself had made barely a pop. No one was going to come running to investigate.\n\nThe rough cheek pressing hard against Farragut's temple pushed his head to an unnatural turn, forced his chin into his own shoulder, immobile.\n\nAugustus' breath puffed against his ear in a whispered growl. \"I have the same orders.\"\n**2**\n\nMINUTES GREW LONG for those who waited on the command deck.\n\nThe deep scowl on the XO's bold features made her look frightening. The deep scowl on the XO's bold features made her\n\nCommander Dent was already an imposing figure, very tall, heavy-boned, hard-muscled, her head shaved. She had a smooth alto voice that she never needed to raise. Gypsy Dent commanded respect on sight.\n\nLieutenant Hamilton's size did not command respect, but _she_ did. Once you'd been dressed down by the Hamster, you never tested her authority again.\n\nAt five foot one with a dainty frame, Glenn Hamilton held her own among the tall, muscular people who surrounded her.\n\nThat the captain had an eye for pretty Glenn Hamilton was a badly kept secret. Farragut was the only one who didn't think his affection was obvious.\n\nThe commander and the lieutenant maintained straight-ahead stoic gazes, scarcely moving.\n\nCaptain Farragut should have reported in by now. Augustus should be dead.\n\nThe command deck was quiet. Time suspended.\n\nCom silence broke. Several sharp intakes of breath met the hail to the command deck.\n\nBut the incoming signal was not an internal transmission. The hail was resonant, and it originated from Earth.\n\nCongress had recognized the U.S. declaration of war.\n\nQord Johnson, the cryptotech, asked Commander Dent, \"Commence Divorce Protocol, sir?\"\n\n\"Not until we hear from the captain,\" said Gypsy. Her scowl took on gargoyle depths.\n\nGlenn Hamilton blurted, \"Something's wrong.\"\n\nThe words were scarcely out when an alarm sounded.\n\nFrom somewhere in the ship, dogs barked.\n\n_Merrimack_ 's dogs seldom barked except in case of fire.\n\n\"Fire,\" the systems tech of the mid watch reported. Systems on the mid watch was a young man named Klaus Nordsen. \"Fire in the port flight hangar,\" Nordsen said, then, immediately, \"Hull access hatch opening. Flight deck.\"\n\nThe hull access would be someone trapped by the fire in the flight hangar making his escape out to the flight deck.\n\n\"Fire crew to port flight hangar,\" Commander Gypsy Dent ordered.\n\n\"Hull access hatch closing,\" Nordsen reported.\n\nThe atmosphere out there between the hull and the ship's surrounding force field was thin and cold. A man did not last long out there without an atmospheric suit. And soon enough, young Nordsen announced, \"Hull access hatch opening. Cargo bay.\"\n\nIt seemed obvious that whoever had just fled the fire in the flight hangar was reentering the ship through the cargo bay's man hatch.\n\nBut Nordsen then reported, \"Cargo doors opening.\"\n\nGypsy moved to Systems' console to see the readouts for herself.\n\nNordsen was right. The hatch in question was not the man hatch, which had shut again. What was opening now were the big doors which admitted the passage of cargo. Even over here in the ship's fuselage on an upper deck, the command crew could feel the pressure change with the big doors' opening. Atmosphere bled out to the space between hull and force field.\n\nNordsen shook his head at his console, still trying to make his readouts fit the actions of men fleeing a fire. \"Why would they do that?\"\n\nGypsy spoke, coldly certain, \"That's Augustus.\"\n\nThe cargo bay was where the Roman Striker was stowed.\n\nThe Striker was a Roman ship, small, long range. Fast, heavily armed. A Striker was custom built to house a patterner.\n\nA Roman patterner inside his Striker was a nearly unstoppable force.\n\nAugustus had destroyed his own Striker back on the planet Sagittarius Zero.\n\nIt was the Striker of an earlier patterner that was clamped down in _Merrimack_ 's cargo bay now.\n\nThe fire in the flight hangar was undoubtedly a diversion for Augustus to get at the Striker in the cargo bay and launch himself to freedom.\n\n\"Lockdown. Lockdown,\" Gypsy commanded.\n\nThe command deck jolted. Crew felt/heard muffled explosions, probably in the flight hangar. More diversions. Or Augustus destroying the _Merrimack_.\n\n\"Lockdown not happening, sir,\" Systems reported. \"I'm showing a command override here.\" Nordsen turned to Commander Dent. \"Override on Captain Farragut's authorization.\"\n\nCommander Dent looked venomous. \"He wouldn't. Override that!\" Gypsy ordered. \"Set force field to adamant.\" She pounced on the com, \"Captain Farragut, please respond!\" And to the com tech, \"Why isn't he answering?\"\n\n\"Sir!\" the com tech acknowledged. \"The captain's personal com is not registering.\"\n\nIt wasn't off. It was not registering at all, which meant the captain's personal com had been damaged or destroyed.\n\nFarragut's personal com was implanted in his wrist.\n\nGypsy spoke into the loud com. Her voice resounded through the ship: \"All hands. All hands. This is the commander. Set Condition Watch One. Siege stations. Siege stations. Hostile in the cargo bay. Secure cargo bay. Eliminate Colonel Augustus.\"\n\nSystems reported, \"Striker is clearing the cargo bay. Cargo doors closing.\"\n\nJust because Augustus was outside the hull did not mean he was free of the ship yet.\n\n\"He is _not_ getting through the force field,\" said Gypsy.\n\nThe ship's force field, rather than her hull, was the ship's true line of containment, what really stood between the ship's atmosphere and vacuum. The low-pressure space between the force field and the hull acted as a kind of air lock.\n\nWith the call to siege stations, _Merrimack_ 's gun barrels retracted, and the ship's force field solidified over the gunports and torpedo tubes and missile launchers. Nothing but layered engine vents broke _Merrimack_ 's energy barrier.\n\nNevertheless, Nordsen reported, \"Force field breach.\"\n\nThis could not be happening.\n\n\"Where?\" Gypsy demanded, looming over the console. She already knew.\n\n\"Cargo bay egress. He's got himself an opening.\"\n\nAugustus the patterner had found a pattern in Mack's command codes to let him out.\n\n\"Seal force field!\" Gypsy ordered.\n\nNordsen attempted to obey even as he voiced concern, \"Not sure how good an idea that is, sir. If we manage to trap Augustus in here, can't he just blow himself up and gut the _Mack_ with him? Hail Caesar and good night _Merrimack_?\"\n\nGypsy waved off the objection. \"He could have done that by now if that's all he wanted. Augustus wants _out_.\"\n\nOnce Augustus was outside _Merrimack_ 's force field, then he could still shoot back through the breach and ream _Merrimack_ 's insides out. Gypsy would not allow that. \"If he guts us, he's coming with us. Get that field sealed _now_.\"\n\nEven if Gypsy had to sacrifice _Mack_ to a Roman suicide, she could not let a Roman patterner in possession of a Striker loose on the galaxy. Because there were bigger targets out there than _Merrimack_.\n\nThere was the Fort Eisenhower/Fort Roosevelt Shotgun.\n\nAnd there was Earth.\n\n\"Striker is clear of force field!\"\n\n\"Damn!\"\n\nNothing to do now but survive him.\n\n\"Seal force field!\" Gypsy ordered as someone, probably Marcander Vincent at Tactical, murmured, \"He's going to wax us.\"\n\nNordsen reported, shouting with relief, \"Force field sealed, aye!\"\n\nGypsy darted the young systems tech a withering glower to tell him it was a little late.\n\nShe heard the com tech dressing down some baboon on his link, \"Stay off the intracom if you don't have anything to report!\"\n\nMarcander Vincent at Tactical announced, \"Striker coming round.\"\n\nGypsy ordered, \"Change field pattern. Random seed.\"\n\nAugustus' knowledge of _Merrimack_ 's codes would enable him to pierce the constantly changing force field unless Mack jumped to an unexpected point in the pattern.\n\nThe Striker came round.\n\nAnd kept going without firing a shot.\n\n\"Striker away!\" Marcander Vincent reported, surprised. \"All speed.\"\n\n\"Track him!\" Gypsy ordered. \"Mister Vincent, don't lose him! Helm! Pursue hostile! I want that bastard. Lieutenant Hamilton! Find the captain. Find out if he's still on board. Get hold of Colonel Steele. Tell him we may have a hostage situation—\"\n\nMovement at the hatch caught her eye. \" _Captain!_ \"\n\n\" _John!_ \" flew out of Hamster's mouth.\n\nFarragut appeared in the hatchway, propped up by the great white rock that was Lieutenant Colonel TR Steele, commander of the two Fleet Marine companies on board _Merrimack_.\n\nA red welt colored Farragut's forehead over a forming lump.\n\nFarragut gestured at his bruised throat, his mouth opening and shutting like a grouper's. He couldn't talk.\n\nHis larynx had been crushed. He entered limping, leaning heavily on the Marine CO.\n\nA burn hole showed through the captain's jacket pocket.\n\nLieutenant Colonel TR Steele of the Fleet Marines was six feet tall and solid, a couple of years younger than Farragut. Steele was a man of enormous courage and loyalty—not a great intellect—not lacking by any means, just not packing any to spare. Steele was as down-to-earth as a man in space could be.\n\nSteele piloted the captain to a seat. Farragut slid down from Steele's rock hard shoulder to sit heavily.\n\nFarragut gingerly pulled off his right boot, the one with an undetonated head buster round lodged in it.\n\nSteele hovered over him, his whole head an enraged shade of scarlet underneath his white-blond buzz-cut hair.\n\nSteele hated the Roman Augustus more than anyone on board _Merrimack_. It was killing him not to be able to kill Augustus.\n\nGypsy's eyes raked Farragut from reddening lump to bare foot. \"Captain, I'm ordering you to the hospital.\"\n\nFarragut nodded. The motion pained his throat and he winced. He held up a forefinger to say: _Yes, but first_. He motioned toward the loud com and mouthed the words, \"Call it.\"\n\nGypsy took up the loud com. \"Now hear this. Now hear this.\" And she read the Congressional resolution to the four hundred and twenty-five crew of the _Merrimack_ and seven hundred and twenty Marines of the 89th Battalion of the Fleet Marine:\n\n\"Whereas the Imperial Government of Palatine has formally declared war against the Government and the People of the United States of America: Therefore be it Resolved, that the state of war between the United States and the Imperial Government of Palatine which has thus been thrust upon the United States is hereby formally declared; and the President is hereby authorized and directed to employ the entire military forces of the United States and the resources of the Government to carry on war against the Imperial Government of Palatine; and, to bring the conflict to a successful termination, all of the resources of the country are hereby pledged by the Congress of the United States.\"\n\nEven on a ship built for just this purpose, the words had a deep impact.\n\nGypsy Dent had a husband and two sons back on Earth.\n\nJohn Farragut had mother, father, twenty brothers and sisters and all of their offspring back in the U.S.\n\nGlenn Hamilton's family—herself and Dr. Patrick Hamilton, ship's xenolinguist—were both here on _Merrimack_.\n\nColonel TR Steele's Marines were his pack. He lived to fight for the United States. Hated Rome. War was good news.\n\nGypsy turned to Farragut who wasn't making any moves toward the hospital yet.\n\nFarragut tapped on the arm of his seat. Gypsy recognized Morse code. When you served on _Merrimack_ you learned Morse. It was the favorite communication system of last resort on board ship.\n\nFarragut's dits and dahs ordered: _Initiate Divorce Protocol_.\n\nGypsy gave the command deck over to the lieutenant so Gypsy could retrieve the Divorce procedure codes from the safe in her cabin. She retrieved Farragut's codes as well, because Farragut's codes were in Gypsy's safe. The captain's own safe had been destroyed earlier during a battle with the Hive.\n\nThe cryptotech Qord Johnson ducked into his forward compartment to get his codes from his safe.\n\nFarragut, through pantomime which only Hamster could figure out, ordered a blast bag brought to the command deck to remove Farragut's boot with the unexploded head buster in it.\n\nHamster also ordered the stores admin to get the captain a new right boot, a new wrist com, and a new sky blue captain's jacket. It was a thing an efficient officer or a close personal friend would think to do. Even so, the knowing glances passed among command deck personnel.\n\nFarragut gave his sidearm back to the Marine guard at the hatch.\n\nOnly when Gypsy returned to the command deck and the procedures of the Divorce Protocol were underway did Captain Farragut surrender himself to the medics.\n\nThe United States armed forces had been ready for the eventuality of a violent split with Rome. They were not expecting it to come like this, but such things never go down as expected.\n\nReality was that the crew and company of _Merrimack_ had been sharing living space on a space battleship with a Roman patterner. They had planned to kill him first thing the conflict went hot.\n\nBut the Roman patterner got away.\n\nThe authors of the protocol recognized that such a thing could happen. Things go wrong. That was an unwritten law of military tactics. Commanders failed to account for it at their peril.\n\nThe U.S. needed to operate under the absolute worst case scenario.\n\nThey needed to assume that Rome had _all_ the U.S. codes.\n\nAccess codes, recognition codes, res harmonics, authorization codes, systems codes, targeting/tracking codes, detonation codes, ops codes, com codes, displacement codes, firing codes for every cannon in the battery, every handgun, every Swift, every long range shuttle, every space patrol transport.\n\nAnd so _Merrimack_ and the entirety of the United States armed forces had to change all of them.\n\nIt was a complicated routine, which must not follow any pattern. Certain changes were designed to be subject to human whim.\n\nThe trick then was the synch up of random decisions with random decisions made in other systems thousands of light-years away.\n\nResonance allowed instant communication across any distance, but Augustus had been in _Merrimack_ 's database, so Augustus possessed all the resonant harmonics currently in Navy use. The harmonics had to be changed and communicated to the Pentagon without Augustus picking up the communication.\n\nThe Divorce Protocol had been in place ever since Caesar Magnus gave Augustus to Captain Farragut at the time of Rome's surrender.\n\nThe procedures for code changes were not stored in any database. They resided in a lot of printed text and antique code-wheels stored in the physical safes of key personnel. Even then the text was not complete, providing another circuit breaker against information leaks. There were blanks to be filled in at the time of the Divorce. The more unexpected the method of blank-filling, the better. There was dice rolling, coin flipping, blindfolded pointing, playing basketball games and using the score to pick numbers.\n\nOne of first procedures in the Protocol was to organize a nano scrub of the entire ship, starting with Captain Farragut, who had been in contact with Augustus.\n\nThe patterner's body was rife with medical nanobots. Augustus may have left some nanomachines behind. And those might not be medical devices he left on _Merrimack_.\n\n_Merrimack_ 's hospital was bigger than most city hospitals.\n\nThe medical officer, Mohsen Shah was waiting for the captain when he arrived from the command deck to the ship's hospital on a levitated stretcher.\n\nDoctor Mo Shah was an ageless man, placid, with warm, sad puppy eyes. A Riverite by creed, Mo took things as they came. \"Be allowing yourself to be relaxing,\" he instructed his patient.\n\nTo a Riverite, everything was a process. \"The River is flowing,\" he told Captain Farragut serenely.\n\nThe River was talking to a salmon.\n\nLying still was not Farragut's natural state. When he lay back and closed his eyes, he was right back there in that chilling moment, in Augustus' grip, unable to move, locked in the control of a malign strength.\n\nThe sensation of being held so still, so helpless, hurtled him back into a childhood memory, when his father used to pin him down in a choke hold and tell him he had to see if he could take it. _You have to know you can take it_. John Farragut never wanted to go back there.\n\nThe ordeal had brought back the same helpless feeling all over again. He could not move.\n\nHe kicked.\n\n\"The River is flowing,\" came Mo's pacific voice.\n\nFortunately Farragut didn't have a voice with which to tell Mo what he could do in his River.\n\nMo turned up the gas.\n\nFarragut's eyes closed themselves. The gas did not relax him. It threw him into twilight.\n\nAugustus' voice came to him once again, speaking against his ear in soft menace: _I have the same orders you do_.\n\nFarragut had been certain in that moment that he was about to die. Knew it and could do nothing about it. But the voice had continued:\n\n\"Fortunately for you, only one of us has his orders from a legitimate government. I need you to let me out.\"\n\nThe strained angle at which Augustus had trapped Farragut's head restricted his air, and Farragut could barely squeak out, \"I can't do that.\"\n\n\"Oh, I wasn't asking you,\" Augustus said, and his thumb smashed the com on Farragut's wrist. Then a quick fist to Farragut's throat crushed his larynx.\n\nFarragut could not breathe, could not inhale or exhale. His throat was completely closed.\n\nFarragut felt his own face turning purple, his lungs burning, trying to expand.\n\nAugustus hauled him up facing him. Red and green blotches swam in the air between Farragut's fading sight and the gaunt face of the patterner.\n\nAugustus' fingers gripped Farragut's throat and yanked his trachea back open.\n\nFarragut inhaled in blinding pain. He tasted blood and tried to cry out. He made no sound louder than a heaving breath.\n\nFarragut was thewed like a bull and loved to fight. He hadn't lost a match in a long time. But Augustus was six foot eight and reinforced with steel and synthetics. Farragut struggled with all the effect of an infant throwing an almighty tantrum. His attempts to get free only annoyed Augustus.\n\nAt some point Augustus had enough, and he struck Farragut hard on both sides of the neck, interrupting the blood flow to his head and folding him to the deck.\n\nFarragut had some awareness of being tossed over Augustus' angular shoulder and carried. Somewhere along the way, Augustus had lobbed an incendiary through a hatch, and climbed a ladder. The deck swam away from Farragut's watering eyes.\n\nA top hatch opened. Wind fluttered up around him into the lesser atmosphere of the hull. And then he was on the hull.\n\nCold. He was upside down and having trouble breathing. Could not draw enough oxygen.\n\nAnd then he was down another hatch, another ladder.\n\nAugustus let him drop in a heap on the deck like a hunter's kill. But he was breathing.\n\nNo one else was here. He heard the fire alarm, heard shouts and stampeding feet passing by on the other side of the partition.\n\nAnd then he saw the Striker.\n\nIt took a moment to register what he was looking at because the colors were wrong. This Striker was blue and white. John Farragut had become accustomed to seeing Augustus' own Striker painted red and black, Flavian colors. Augustus' Striker had been destroyed.\n\nAugustus recently liberated this blue-and-white Striker from a madman who got it from another dead patterner.\n\nAugustus had not been able to enlist any of _Merrimack_ 's crew to repaint the Striker for him.\n\nThis Striker had the same evil lines as his own. But there was no hard ordnance left on the hard points. Those had been spent over a half century ago by its original owner. Still, the Striker had its energy weapons.\n\nAugustus used Captain Farragut's biometrics—his retina print, his fingerprint, his DNA—to authorize a launch window through _Merrimack_ 's force field, and to override attempts from the command deck to lock him in.\n\nHe didn't need Farragut's voice print. Voices were too easy to duplicate.\n\nThe cargo doors opened.\n\nThe higher pressure air of _Mack_ 's atmosphere rushed out with a moan through the wide doors to the layer of thinner air held between the hull and the force field.\n\nNow, Farragut thought, now will he kill me?\n\nAugustus should have killed him long ago and always regretted not doing it when he first had the chance.\n\nHe ought to now.\n\nAugustus climbed onto his Striker, rode it up the lift through the cargo doors.\n\nThe cargo doors were shutting. The outrush of air sped up through the narrowing egress. Augustus' black clothes fluttered in the wind. He looked down like a perverse angel. He was not aiming a weapon at Farragut down there, lying flat on his back looking up from the deck.\n\nAugustus was not going to kill him.\n\nAugustus had already told him why:\n\n_Only one of us has his orders from a legitimate government._\n\nAugustus did not recognize Romulus. To Augustus, no legitimate authority had declared this war.\n\nWithout a war, blowing up _Merrimack_ or killing Captain John Farragut would be acts of piracy and murder. Augustus was not a pirate.\n\nAugustus, now and always, served Rome.\n\n\"John Farragut.\"\n\nAugustus the battered warrior looked down on him from atop his Striker. His face looked like seamed granite carved into the semblance of perfect Roman features. Cables in his forearms and behind his neck hung loose, unplugged.\n\n\"When we cross paths again, know that I will not hesitate to kill you.\"\n\nFarragut whispered, all breath, no voice, \"Yes, you will.\"\n\nMaybe Augustus heard him, maybe he read his lips, but Augustus blinked. He said something obscene in Latin, dropped into his cockpit, and the cargo doors banged shut between them.\n\nFarragut stagger-crawled across the cargo bay to an authorization pad. He fumbled to cancel all authorizations that would permit opening the force field. He could not speak the instructions and he could not key fast enough.\n\nHe heard the breach forming in the field, heard the Striker power up and push off the hull.\n\nThe force field resealed.\n\nCaptain Farragut heard himself being paged.\n\nHe crawled to an intracom, rose up to his knees and hit the intracom. He hailed the command deck, whispering.\n\nThe intracom would not register the shape of his voiceless breaths.\n\nThe com tech on the command deck scolded him to get off the intracom if he wasn't going to say anything.\n\nFarragut charged into the briefing room, trying out his restored voice box on his assembled officers, \"Do I look like a pork butt, because I sure feel like one?\"\n\nColonel Steele stood at one end of the table. He flushed dark, mortified. He would not sit. The Marines who policed _Merrimack_ were Steele's men. One Roman had turned the proud Fleet Marines of the 89th into cartoon tail-chasers.\n\nSitting at the table was the ship's Naval Intelligence officer, Colonel Bradley Zolman. Colonel Z was a dark-haired man of middle height, lean as a ferret. His face might have been attractive if he ever smiled, but that theory had never been tested as far as anyone on _Merrimack_ knew. Captain Farragut could not call him humorless, but Colonel Z was definitely humor deficient.\n\nCommander Gypsy Dent was also here, stony, embarrassed at her own failure to contain the patterner.\n\nTwo xenos, Doctor Weng and Doctor Sidowski, held down the far end of the table. Weng's and Ski's uniforms were so pristine that the two men might have been CIA incognito. Scientists' uniforms got unfolded from their original bags about as often as CIA pretenders' uniforms did. Anything other than a lab coat made a xeno feel like a dog dressed up for a tea party. Weng and Ski had neglected to add their proper insignia to their uniforms, so they looked as badly dressed as they felt.\n\nAlso in the briefing room was _Merrimack_ 's chief engineer, Kit Kittering, a little doll of an officer, boy slender, with short dark hair, big round baby doll eyes, and the foulest mouth on board ship. Apparently just about everything in Kit's world was capable of fornication.\n\n\"Where do we stand now?\" said Farragut, roving the length of the briefing room, too agitated to sit.\n\n\"At war,\" said the IO in the most compact of nutshells. Colonel Z elaborated as best he could. \"The exact nature of the war is not clear. Romulus never presented us with an ultimatum.\"\n\n\"Has Rome attacked anyone?\"\n\n\"Not so far,\" said Colonel Z. \"So far as we know.\"\n\nThere was a lot the _Merrimack_ might not know from out here in the Deep, orbiting a planet that lay off the edge of all the maps.\n\n\"Word is that Romulus is expelling Americans from Roman ground and Roman space,\" the IO continued. \"Romulus is confiscating all U.S. equipment on Roman soil. He already recalled Roman soldiers from U.S. territories before he declared war. We knew this was coming. We just expected quite a few more steps between that and this.\"\n\n\"Do we know what Romulus expects to get out of the war?\" Gypsy asked. \"What it will take to finish it?\"\n\n\"We don't know,\" said the IO. \"And strategy is not our business. This is the Navy, not the Executive Office.\"\n\n\"It's our business to know what _we're_ doing out here,\" Farragut told Colonel Z. \"I haven't received orders. You?\" Farragut would not put it past the Intelligence community to angle around him.\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Colonel Z. \"I have my hands full executing the Divorce Protocol.\"\n\nIt sounded like an excuse but Farragut recognized that the Divorce was a huge task. \"We're knocked blind and sideways out here.\"\n\n\"With the Hive,\" Doctor Weng reminded him.\n\n\"We're out here with the Hive,\" said Doctor Sidowski.\n\n\"I know that, gentlemen,\" Farragut acknowledged.\n\nA new Hive swarm had emerged right down there on the planet Telecore below them.\n\nAt the moment, the gorgons of Telecore were stranded on Telecore. The new gorgons seemed to be as inept as one might expect of any newly hatched thing. But Hives could learn—faster than people learned evidently, because the first Hive had driven Rome's armed forces to the brink of extinction.\n\nThese new gorgons had not figured out that they could fly. And no one knew how long it would take them to learn that they could not only fly, but they could escape the planet's gravity, survive in a vacuum, retain mobility in the deepest cold of space and achieve faster-than-light travel when collected together in a sphere. It could take years, centuries, even millennia, for them to learn. Or they could be chasing _Merrimack_ tomorrow.\n\nThe xenos had known little enough about the earlier Hive. This new Hive presented a whole different set of unknowns. First among those, Farragut put to the xenos: \"Why aren't they dead? There's nothing to eat down there.\"\n\nThe Hive was polymorphic. The cells on Telecore were the gorgon type—the eating form. A gorgon appeared as a large dark shapeless sac covered all over in hoselike tentacles, any one of which could take a good bite out of you, because all the tentacles terminated in mouths. The moment the new gorgons erupted out of the Telecore ground, they snapped up everything edible.\n\nThe planet's meager food was swiftly exhausted and the gorgons were looking for more.\n\n\"We think—\" said Ski.\n\n\"Maybe—\" Weng hedged.\n\n\"We have an idea—\"\n\n\"A hypothesis—\"\n\nFarragut could see his exec, Gypsy Dent, on the edge of her chair, glaring at the two scientists as if she might reach down the table and smack them upside the head to make one of them finish a sentence.\n\nDoctor Sidowski must have seen her, because he blurted without qualifiers, \"They're powered by resonance.\"\n\nFaces around the briefing table wore stunned expressions. Captain Farragut was not shocked. The suggestion had been made to him a long time ago that the Hive was a single vast interstellar organism cohered by resonance.\n\nThe theory had since been supported by the manner in which the previous Hive perished. Commodore Farragut's Attack Group One had exterminated the original Hive by disrupting its intergalactic nervous system with a single resonant pulse.\n\nAs a unified resonant being, the Hive whole might subsist on energy consumed by any of its cosmically scattered units. It was rather preposterous to think on, but the only theory that fit the preposterous facts.\n\nOne thing humankind had learned from the first Hive: you can't starve a gorgon.\n\nAs long as some part of the Hive somewhere in the universe had enough to eat, the gorgons of Telecore might realistically wait the best part of forever for their next meal.\n\n\"Probably,\" Farragut allowed the resonance-sharing premise. \"But we've seen swarms drop below some magic number where they're not worth maintaining.

It makes products that allow retailers to check inventory, quicken the replenishment cycle, prevent out-of-stocks and reduce theft. Checkpoint offers Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS) radio frequency solutions for retail, high-theft and loss-prevention solutions, RFID hardware, software, and labeling capabilities.\n##History\nThe checkpoint was invented in the United States during the 1960s, when Peter Stern, who was president of the Board of Library Directors in the city of Philadelphia, was deeply concerned about the widespread theft of books from public libraries. He was the leader of a team of researchers working at a privately held converter of paperboard and paper, and believed this was a problem his team could tackle and that a system could be developed to prevent books from being stolen. Thus the CHECKPOINT system was developed and patented.date=July 2018\n### 1977–1998 \nThe CHECKPOINT system was based on sheets of non-ferrous metal laminated into flexible tags, which reacted with magnetic metal-detection technology housed in a turnstile. Trim and unobtrusive, these paper tags could be attached to book covers. In 1969, Checkpoint Systems was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Logistics Industries Corporation. Eight years later, on June 30, 1977, Checkpoint was spun off from its parent company and began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol CHECK. By then, the company's CHECKPOINT technology was already being adapted for use in retail.\nWithin the next twenty years, Checkpoint Systems implemented RF electronic article surveillance (EAS) across different stores and in October 1993, the company's common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CKP. Its operations expanded through acquisitions, and in the mid-1990s, after purchasing two European systems manufacturers, Checkpoint established direct access to the European market. Its security systems were marketed to retail customers, including drug store chains, hypermarkets, supermarkets, mass merchandisers, discount stores and electronics retailers, as well as libraries in the United States.\n###1999–2006\nIn 1999, Checkpoint Systems broadened its product offering with the purchase of METO, a German provider of handheld labeling systems used by food and discount retailers to brand and price mark merchandise. The newly acquired company doubled Checkpoint's revenues and helped to expand relationships with European retailers. Two years later, Checkpoint bought A.W. Printing Inc., a U.S.-based printer of tickets, tags, and labels for apparel retailers and brand owners. This acquisition expanded the company's label printing operations and gave entrée to customers in the soft goods market segment.\nBy the mid-2000s, Checkpoint had a source tagging program, facilitated by the company's service bureau business.

Instead they had to spend the night in a nearby village. The farm where they found shelter was on elevated ground, and among the images the boy could later recall from his childhood was a stroll in the open on the night that Dresden burned. Quietly but with a definite feeling of triumph, he occasionally spoke of this night—as if there were personal merit in having survived the disaster. When the refugees returned to their quarters, the grownups stayed up for a long time. The boy was put to bed, but the door was left open a crack, letting in light. So he could see above him a lamp with strings of glass beads that softly clinked back and forth. Could any German artillery or flak have remained to shake the ground and make the lamp move? Sleep came swiftly.\n\nThe boy could not have known that, at the same time, his father was only two kilometers away—two thousand meters up in the sky above Dresden, to be exact—as one of the few German fighter pilots who had scrambled to attack the Allied bomber fleet. That night, most of the pilots had rushed from flash to flash and had finally had to land without ever making contact with the enemy. German air defenses were having increasing difficulty figuring out the course and destination of the English and American bomber squadrons. Often the fighter pilots had to use incidental clues from the ground to guess where they should fly.\n\nWhen the boy's father took off with his squadron on the evening of February 13, the men initially flew toward Strasbourg in a waiting pattern, circling there to receive destination orders from the ground. The orders, however, never came. The crew included a pilot, an observer, a gunner, and a radio man. When the ground spotting station suddenly rebroadcast a radio program with Richard Strauss's waltz sequences from his opera _Der Rosenkavalier_ , the educated men on board—two crew members had doctorates—thought they knew where they should fly: Vienna. So they headed toward the city that provides the setting for the _Rosenkavalier_. Yet the longer they flew, the more they doubted that Vienna was really the target of the Allied attack. Then the gunner remembered the city where the opera had had its world premiere on January 26, 1911, and so they turned back toward Dresden to prevent what could no longer be prevented.\n\nAll this is hard to believe, but this is the story my father told much later, when he felt able to talk about what he had done and what had happened to him during the war. The music of Richard Strauss remained, in a curious way, a basso continuo to the ongoing work of the destruction of German cities, \"an absolutely devastating exterminating attack by very heavy bombers,\" as Churchill described it to Lord Beaverbrook. Among the reminiscences the writer W. G. Sebald has assembled about the air raids on Germany is the narrative of a man who listened, as he said, \"on the radio to some songs from the sensuous Rococo world of Strauss's magical music\" immediately before the devastating raid on Darmstadt.1 Shortly after the First World War, Walter Hasenclever had written a poem directed against the bellicose German military, which ended with the refrain \"The murderers sit in the _Rosenkavalier_.\"\n\nBombs over Dresden and the _Rosenkavalier_ in the skies create a disturbing image that suggests itself to me as a symbol of the close connection that war and culture, education and destruction, politics and poetry, and spirit and violence had entered into in Germany.2 When the news that Dresden had been destroyed reached the Nazi leadership, Robert Ley, head of the German Labor Front, reacted as if a heavy burden had been lifted from his shoulders: \"We can] almost heave a sigh of relief. It is over. Now we will no longer be distracted by the monuments of German culture!\"[3 Three years earlier, Goebbels had reacted in a similar manner after a British bomber attack on the city of Rostock. He did not mention human casualties at all, but spoke only of the necessity to answer terror with terror and to flatten English \"centers of culture\" after German centers had been destroyed by the Royal Air Force. It was well known in Nazi Germany that the loss of great works of art hit Hitler much harder than the destruction of large residential districts.5 German propagandists allowed this to be known, convinced that Hitler's reaction would be seen as a sign not of his brutal disregard for human suffering but of his artistic sensibility that the war had not been able to destroy.\n\nBut not only Hitler and his consorts saw the Allied bomber attacks as above all an attempt to destroy German culture. In May 1942, German Jewish e´migre´s in the United States planned a large fund-raising campaign that would enable them to donate a bomber, to be called \"Loyalty,\" to the U.S. Air Force. They tried to enlist Thomas Mann to chair their campaign's West Coast committee. Mann was furious. He would have agreed to collect money for the Red Cross or to buy war bonds, but he found it impossible to support the air raids that were, though by necessity, destroying German cities: \"I do not want, after my death, that Germans who read my books—or don't read them—think of myself as chairman of a committee responsible for the destruction of German monuments of culture.\"6 Mann was probably right in anticipating the German mind-set: people knew about the thirty thousand casualties the air raid on Dresden cost, but the city also became a symbol, maybe even more well known, of the destruction of cultural treasures, above all the Frauenkirche now rebuilt.\n\nWhen Ian Buruma reviewed works by the historian Jörg Friedrich on Germany's suffering during the bombing war, he pointed out that Friedrich's book _Der Brand_ ended \"with a long lament for the destruction of German books kept in libraries and archives. The lament is justified, but its placement at the end of a 592-page book is curious, as though the loss of books, in the end, is even worse than the loss of people—which, from a particular long-term perspective, may actually be true; but that does not make it morally attractive. . . .The real calamity, as it is presented in Friedrich's book, is the destruction of beautiful old cities, of ancient churches, rococo palaces, baroque town halls, and medieval streets.\"7 Buruma is certainly right in interpreting _Der Brand_ (The fire) as an attempt to correct a \"collective turning away from German history and culture,\" but I am not sure that Friedrich's diagnosis is correct. Writers and historians, perhaps, have not paid enough attention to cultural losses. In the collective memory of the Germans, how ever, names like Dresden are reminders as much of the loss of monuments of culture as of human life. The attitude of my father, who could not speak of the burning of Dresden without mentioning the _Rosenka-valier_ , was, among his generation, more the rule than the exception.\n\nAs Norbert Elias wrote in his book _The Germans_ , \"embedded in the meaning of the German term 'culture' was a non-political and perhaps even an anti-political bias symptomatic of the recurrent feeling among the German middle-class elites that politics and the affairs of the state represented the area of their humiliation and lack of freedom, while culture represented the sphere of their freedom and their pride. During the eighteenth and part of the nineteenth centuries, the anti-political bias of the middle-class concept of 'culture' was directed against the politics of autocratic princes. . . .At a later stage, this anti-political bias was turned against the parliamentary politics of a democratic state.\"8 Elias here describes the role of culture in German \"domestic policy\"; its role in \"foreign policy\" was characterized, says Elias in _The Civilizing_ _Process_ , by the German obsession with distinguishing between civilization and culture: \"In German usage, _Zivilisation_ means something which is indeed useful, but nevertheless only a value of the second rank, comprising only the outer appearance of human beings, the surface of human existence. The word through which Germans interpret themselves, which more than any other expresses their pride in their own achievement and their own being, is _Kultur_.\" Whereas the French as well as the English concept of culture can also refer to politics and to economics, to technology and to sports, to moral and to social facts, \"the German concept of _Kultur_ refers essentially to intellectual, artistic, and religious facts, and has a tendency to draw a sharp dividing line between facts of this sort, on the one side, and political, economic, and social facts, on the other.\"\n\nUltimately not only the German middle classes but Germany as a whole has distinguished itself by its cultural achievements and aspirations. The domestic appeal of culture, accompanied by a mandarin-like scorn for everyday politics, has been based on the assertion of the deeply apolitical nature of the \"German soul\"—an assertion that eventually nurtured Germany's claim, as a _Kulturnation_ , to superiority vis-a`-vis the merely \"civilized\" West. This peculiar role of culture in German domestic as well as foreign policy is the theme of this book. I deal with the \"German seduction,\" the tendency to see in culture a noble substitute for politics, if not a better politics altogether.\n\nDescribing the antipolitical bias in the German notion of \"culture,\" Elias found it astonishing \"to see the persistence with which specific patterns of thinking, acting and feeling recur, with characteristic adaptations to new developments, in one and the same society over many generations. It is almost certain that the meaning of certain key-words and particularly the emotional undertones embedded in them, which are handed on from one generation to another unexamined and often unchanged, plays a part in the flexible continuity of what one otherwise conceptualizes as 'national character.' \"10 Analyzing the German usage of \"culture\" as an antipolitical key word, I, however, prefer to speak not of a national character but of a national attitude. A national character resembles a body's skin, which may be stretched—\"flexible continuity\"—but which the body cannot get rid of. An attitude, in contrast, is characterized by a certain looseness; it resembles a favorite item of clothing that one can put on and off and that one can change when one's own mood or fad and fashion require it. \"National character\" is a serious term, whereas \"attitude\" has a touch of irony in it—as in the term \"Anglo-Saxon attitudes,\" whose ironic undertone was apparent when Lewis Carroll coined it in _Through the Looking Glass_ in 1871 and became even more visible when Angus Wilson used it as the title of his 1956 novel.11 Irony was a counterweight against the confidence with which the British believed in their own civilization and wanted it to be acknowledged as superior by the rest of the world. The triumphant tone with which the Germans speak of \"culture,\" which only they possess, while the rest must make do with \"civilization,\" needs an equally, if not stronger, ironic distance.\n\nThis book examines the German attitude of regarding culture as a substitute for politics and of vilifying politics, understood above all as parliamentary politics, as nothing but an arena of narrow-minded, interest-group bargaining and compromise. But this work is not a debate on the _Sonderweg_ (special path) in disguise, asserting that the aversion to politics and the idealist and romantic veneration of culture were the main reason why Germany departed from the \"normal\" Western course of development and steered into the disaster of Nazism. I do not describe an attitude that is a uniquely German phenomenon. Still, I argue that an overestimation of cultural achievements and a \"strange indifference to politics\" (G.P. Gooch) nowhere played a greater role than in Germany and have nowhere else survived to the same degree. Seeing culture as a substitute for politics has remained a prevailing attitude throughout German history—from the glorious days of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Weimar through, though now in considerably weaker form, the reunification of the two Germanys after the fall of communism. Peter Gay, Georg Mosse, Fritz Ringer, Fritz Stern, Peter Viereck, and others have explored this specific German attitude toward culture and politics. I am revisiting their arguments and try to offer new insights into an old problem.\n\nIn the area of \"domestic policy,\" I follow a roughly chronological pattern, beginning with the view of culture as a \"noble\" substitute for politics that originated in the heyday of Weimar classicism. This distance toward parliamentary politics in the name of culture was one reason why the Weimar Republic did not secure the broad-based acceptance and emotional support of its citizens that could have prevented it from falling prey to the Nazis. I regard the aesthetic appeal first of fascism and then of National Socialism not as a superficial phenomenon of the most sinister period in German history, but as an important element in the attempt to explain the attractiveness of Nazi ideology for a large segment of the German bourgeoisie and many German writers, artists, and intellectuals. And even for members of the intelligentsia in exile, the attitude of playing off culture against politics remained. After the Second World War, staying aloof from parliamentary politics on cultural grounds made less and less sense with the integration of the Federal Republic and eventually of a reunited Germany into the mainstream of Western democracies. Still, the tension between old cultural aspirations and new political realities helps to explain developments first in both German states and then, finally, in a country that no longer had to resign itself, as a consequence of a self-inflicted political catastrophe, to remaining solely a cultural nation, but found itself bestowed with the gift of a political reunion.\n\nIn the area of \"foreign policy,\" I have concentrated on two case studies—along with a brief glance at Central Europe, where the various revolutions that did away with communism were hailed, at least for a while, as a victory of culture over politics. The first case study deals with the \"culture wars\"—a term, as far as I can tell, invented in France—that have been so important, throughout history, in shaping French German relations. The second case study addresses the interplay between German cultural legacies and American political traditions. The chapter on European and American cultural patriotism is a coda to the German-American case study, an example of how loudly the debate over the relationship between culture and politics reverberates down to the European-American rift witnessed in the recent past.\n\nMy account does not seek to compete with the well-established approaches of political and social history, and I have not tried to tell a continuous narrative in which the different periods of German history are neatly interwoven with one another. I am aware of the limitations of my history-of-ideas approach. The wish to secure Germany's dominance on the European continent led Bismarck to found the Reich after Prussia's victory over France in 1871; the transformation of the cultural nation into a cultural state was a welcome consequence, but not the primary intention, of Bismarck's strategy. The skepticism of Germany's poet-seers toward parliamentary politics was one factor that led to the demise of the Weimar Republic, but it was not the decisive one, compared with the specter of Versailles, the shock of inflation, huge unemployment, and the revival of nationalist and racist ideologies. The Nazis were brought to power not so much by the aesthetic appeal of their rituals as by their pledge to restore German pride, their promise to limit the power of big corporations and to create jobs, and their appeal to widespread anti-Semitic feelings, among other reasons. After the war, the inner developments in the German Democratic Republic were also characterized by the cultural policy of its elites, but this policy depended on the continuous strategic interest of the Soviet Union in profiting from East Germany as a political and military glacis against the capitalist West. Political apathy and cultural excitement prevailed in postwar West Germany, at least for most intellectual observers, yet the country's quick political and economic recovery was fueled by pragmatically oriented political leaders, who knew how to run a trade union, organize a party, and administer a pension fund.\n\nIn short, intellectual history is an addition, but no alternative, to social and political history. Intellectual history is, to a considerable degree, the history of a small group only, the history of intellectuals. Only intellectuals themselves take the impact of intellectuals on the course of events for granted; the question whether and how their ideas were transmitted to a larger audience and what kind of influence they may eventually have exerted must often remain unanswered. One might see in intellectual history or the history of ideas not much more than an ornament on the building of social and political history that could easily be removed from it. After removing it, though, the building would certainly not collapse but it would not be the same building anymore. Intellectual history is not a superficial but a useful adornment of political and social history, reminding us that human societies are characterized not just by what people do, but also by what people say and think they are doing. History is not only about what is happening, history is also about making sense.\n\nAn attitude is an act of interpretation: it is a comment about what is happening or should happen in a society. This book describes an intellectual attitude that can be observed throughout German history: the overrating of culture at the expense of politics, especially in the sense of parliamentary politics. Rather than telling a grand narrative, I will take my reader on a tour and draw her attention to a series of vignettes or \"constellations\" in which this attitude comes to the fore in different historical circumstances. I hope the tour will take on coherence through the kaleidoscopic recurrence of problems and themes, leitmotifs and authors that play a role in several of these constellations. At some points on this tour I will follow a guide in whose life and letters the \"German attitude\" toward culture and politics, in different facets and variations, miscues and paradoxes, has found its most eloquent, often painfully honest and always ironic expression: Thomas Mann.\n\nThis is a book on the history of ideas. One cannot understand German history by talking solely about German intellectual life, but one can understand German history more fully by taking intellectual life into account.\n\nCulture: A Noble Substitute\n\n_Lessons in Diminished Particularity_\n\nIf there is anything that can be called a specific German ideology, it consists in playing off romanticism against the Enlightenment, the Middle Ages against the modern world, culture against civilization, and _Gemeinschaft_ against _Gesellschaft_. Based on cultural aspirations and achievements, the belief that Germany was traveling a special path, a _Sonderweg_ , was always a point of pride in the land of poets and thinkers. The inward realm established by German idealism, the classic literature of Weimar, and the Classical and Romantic styles in music preceded the founding of the political nation by more than a hundred years. Henceforth, they gave a special dignity to the withdrawal of the individual from politics into the sphere of culture and private life. Culture was seen as a noble substitute for politics.\n\nHaving thus described the German ideology in my first book _Melancholy_ _and Society_ (1969), I was pleased when Hans Magnus Enzensberger quoted my argument in one of his essays. Pleasure turned into perplexity, though, when I realized that he had used my own words to characterize the modern history of—Spain. Thus I was taught an ironic lesson: German history is not nearly as exceptional as the Germans are inclined to believe. Culture has been seen as a substitute for politics at many times and in many places. In Spain, the writers and intellectuals of the \"Generation of 1898\" were convinced that only a cultural renaissance ( _renovaci_  _on estetica_ ) could rejuvenate their homeland ( _laregeneració_ _n de España_ ) after the last significant Spanish colonies overseas had been lost in the war against the United States. In France, writing entries for the _Encyclope_  _die_ and performing plays like Beaumarchais' _Barber of Seville_ became a substitute for politics at the time of the Enlightenment, when domestic political action was barred; after the French had been defeated by the Prussians in 1871, political and military revenge had to be postponed and were preceded instead by a \"culture war.\" In Russia, the life and letters of Pushkin were described as an example of how art could serve as an alternative to politics, whereas later literature—the pamphlets and novels, plays, and poems of the intelligentsia—paved the way for the overthrow of the tsarist regime. In Ireland, W. B. Yeats treated the literary renaissance of the 1890s \"as a case of culture filling a political vacuum, after the death of Parnell in 1891 and the failure of Westminster to deliver Home Rule in 1893. . . . Young people, disillusioned with politics, were turning to culture to express a national identity and achieve a measure of intellectual freedom.\"1 The preeminence given to culture in Germany, and its use—and abuse—as a substitute for politics, seems to be just one case among others.\n\nIn recent decades, this lesson in diminished particularity has been convincingly taught in attempts to show the persistence of the ancien regime in all of modern Europe; in the examination of the interconnectedness of Europe's societies and their politics in the decade after the First World War; in the reconstruction of a cycle of German national doctrines whose ideological transitions, rather than ideological persistence, are seen as characteristic; and in the assurance that cultural pessimism was not a German specialty, but rather a feature of bourgeois societies in general.\n\nThese attempts, persuasive in different ways, yet convergent in counteracting \"the chronic overstatement of the unfolding and ultimate triumph of modernity,\" have done much to reinsert Germany's peculiar past into a broader context of European history.3 At the same time, they have reflected a climate of opinion that has enticed revisionist historians to insist on the imitative character of National Socialism, whose ideology, they claim, was modeled on the original fascisms of Latin Europe, and whose atrocities only mirrored the earlier crimes of Stalinism. One might remind these historians of Thorstein Veblen's remark that, as a rule, the Nordic races improve considerably what they borrow. Using chronology not only as an explanation but also, equally falsely, as an excuse, the revisionists have sought to reduce German particularity to a European normality.4 The Holocaust, in this view, was not much else than a dreadful accident on a road where careless and ideology-intoxicated driving was not the exception but the rule. The historian's search for \"normality\" in writing about the Nazi regime and the Holocaust may easily lead to understanding and understanding may eventually lead to oblivion and to forgiveness: _Tout comprendre c'est tout pardonner_.\n\n_A Strange Indifference to Politics_\n\nIt remains a challenge for historians to understand the rise of National Socialism and the nightmarish consequences of the Nazi regime without resorting too easily to the viewpoint that Germany was on a special path throughout its history or at least since Bismarck founded the empire after the Prussian victory over France in the war of 1870–71. Many philosophers in ensuing decades were convinced that only philosophy could come up with an explanation for such developments that, at first glance, eluded historical understanding. This was the argument in John Dewey's _German Philosophy and Politics_ as well as in George Santayana's _Egotism in German Philosophy_ , published in 1915 and 1916, respectively.\n\nDewey's book had its origin in lectures given at the University of North Carolina in 1915. He singled out Kant's doctrine of the two realms—\"one outer, physical and necessary, the other inner, ideal and free . . . primacy always lying] with the inner\"—as the most important element for understanding German national life;[5 and George Santayana did the same when he described transcendental philosophy as the Germans' preferred \"method of looking for reality in one's own breast\"—adding \"that the German breast was no longer that anatomical region which Locke had intended to probe, but a purely metaphysical point of departure.\"6 For Santayana, Germany's political actions were nothing but a consequence of German thought characterized above all by a perverse inwardness, glorifying an egotism that other nations regarded as an impediment to be gotten rid of as quickly as possible. For Dewey, a \"supreme regard for the inner meaning of things . . . in disregard of external consequences of advantage or disadvantage\" distinguished the German spirit from the worldliness of the Latin mind-set or the utilitarianism of the Anglo-Saxon nations. Even German authors ridiculed the \"German spirit.\" In 1933, the year the Nazis came to power, Oswald Spengler described the Germans as a people poor and pitiful who dreamed of an empire in the clouds and called it German idealism. The land of poets and thinkers was in danger of becoming a province of babblers and demagogues ( _Hetzer und Schw_  _atzer_ ).7 Yet some critics, Dewey among them, also admired the pervasiveness of the transcendental method, which had made Germany the only country in the world where even cavalry generals employed metaphysics to bring home practical lessons. Other observers hated metaphysics for exactly this reason, Flaubert called the Prussian soldiers who were bombarding Paris \"Hegel's compatriots.\"\n\nAt the beginning of and during the Second World War, both Dewey and Santayana republished books they had written in the middle of the First World War. They reprinted them without any alteration, for apparently Germany had not changed at all. \"Culture\" had remained the catchword by which the Germans tried to distinguish themselves from the rest of the civilized world, but \"culture is a thing seldom mentioned by those who have it,\" as Santayana remarked.8 Whenever he taught German metaphysics at Harvard during the First World War, he felt that \"under its obscure and fluctuating tenets [was] . . . something sinister at work, something at once hollow and aggressive\"—a statement of inspired vagueness sharpened, during the Second World War, by Dewey, who spoke of the \"underlying strains of continuity connecting the creed of Hitler with the classic philosophic tradition of Germany.\"  Such claims of continuity—which were often stretched to claims of causality—were reinforced by the Holocaust, the singular collective crime that doomed Germany and seemed to seal its separation from the mainstream of Western civilization once and for all. Yet attempts to construe causal links between the sphere of politics and the spiritual realm have not been convincing—regardless of whether individuals like Luther, Kant, Schelling, and Nietzsche or intellectual movements like idealism or romanticism were seen as the beginning of a road that inevitably, with Hitler, turned out to be a dead end. Whether one calls it introspection or inwardness, emotional individualism or philosophical egotism—none of these traits belongs exclusively to the German national character.\n\nHow could Germany become a modern economy without fostering modern social values and political institutions at the same time? This question is usually answered by referring to the preponderance of the state, which gave from above what, in other countries, the bourgeoisie had to fight for and acquire through its own efforts. Modern Germany, it has been argued, \"thought primarily in terms of the might and majesty of the state, modern England primarily in terms of the rights and liberties of the citizen.\"11 In this view, Germany, land of obedience, as Herder and others had called it, is contrasted with the land of the free—England. Although this distinction is rather crude, one can hardly deny that idolization of the state has shaped the contours of German society and the course of German history to a large extent.\n\nA look into Matthew Arnold's _Culture and Anarchy_ (1869) helps to point out the peculiarities of the confrontation of culture with politics in Germany.12 Arnold's essay in political and social criticism was an answer to the attack on the chatter about culture that Frederic Harrison had called \"perhaps the very silliest cant of the day.\" Harrison, an English follower of Auguste Comte's positivism, accepted \"culture\" as the required quality of a literary critic or a belletrist, but he rejected any role for culture in politics, where it necessarily would lead to \"indecision in action.\" Therefore men of culture were perhaps \"the only class of responsible beings in the community who cannot with safety be entrusted with power.\"13 Arnold made it clear that for him the word \"culture\" designated much more than just the quality of a good literary critic, yet he emphasized that he did not aim to turn men of culture into politicians. The reason for his reluctance, however, was not that men of culture were unfit for political action. Rather, the deficiency of the current political system had to be deplored because it did not yet permit the intrusion of culture into the world of power. Culture was \"a study of perfection,\" a passion for doing good that in many ways resembled religion. In this respect the modern world was in desperate need of culture, not least in England, where most people believed that the greatness of their country consisted above all in coal and iron.\n\nThose who mocked the \"religion of culture\" were, to a large extent, members of the middle class, representatives of trade and religious dissent whose maxim \"everyman for himself in business, everyman for himself in religion\" was responsible, said Arnold, for a dangerous weakening of the moral fabric of English society and a reckless contempt for the state. Arnold sounded rather un-English when he praised the no tion of the state that had been so familiar to antiquity and was still familiar on the Continent. For him, the state represented \"the nation in its collective and corporate character, entrusted with stringent powers for the general advantage, and controlling individual wills in the name of an interest wider than that of individuals.\"14 The English national idea, however, was as remote from this notion of the state as one could possibly imagine. In England, it was Everyman's deep conviction that he had the right to do as he liked. The national idea fostered the \"relaxed habits of government\" and eventually tended to anarchy. Culture was the necessary antidote—but it needed the support of the state to survive and, if possible, to be strengthened.\n\nArnold reminded his English readers that Wilhelm von Humboldt, who had made a strong plea for individual self-perfection and the restraint of state activity in his book _The Sphere and Duties of Government_ , was nevertheless convinced that the action of the state would still be needed for a long time to come. Arnold also quoted the French liberal Ernest Renan's warning that modern societies would be in jeopardy if the state withdrew its engagement in public matters too soon.15 Arnold's praise of the strong state sounded \"German\" or at least \"Continental,\" and his recommendation to the English to apply a more \"inward operation\" to their own culture must have appeared equally \"German\" to them.\n\nMatthew Arnold's thoughts, however, were not the reflections of an apolitical man. He was aware that in England people cherished the idea of country as a sentiment; what he wanted to put forward in addition was the idea of the state as a \"working power.\" Culture was needed above all to achieve this goal, not as a compensation for politics, but as the most effective means to change politics as it had been exercised in England over a long period of time. Arnold stressed that he was pursuing a social idea; he insisted that men of culture were the \"true apostles of equality,\" since they wanted culture to be made efficient outside the \"clique of the cultivated and learned.\"16 Using culture as the most effective weapon in his fight against anarchy, Arnold was anything but indifferent to politics. The _Daily Telegraph_ was misled when it took him to task for his supposed indifference to political action by calling him an \"elegant Jeremiah.\" Regardless of whether the prophet Jeremiah was not more of a politician than the _Daily Telegraph_ wanted its readers to believe, _Culture and Anarchy_ certainly was a powerful piece of political and social criticism and therefore constituted a political action at the same time.\n\nTo outsiders it has often seemed that Germans have been obsessed with claiming the uniqueness of their culture and its superiority over Western civilization. But it has not always been understood that this pride was also the result of political disappointments. It was a poet, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, who led Germany toward unification—not because he gave poetry priority over politics, but because unification was not yet a political option in his time. The Germans had no choice: they had to establish a national theater before they were able to become a nation. As long as the bourgeois was denied political participation and thus did not become a citizen, he had to use the theater to play virtual politics. But even Lessing's idea of creating a national theater in Hamburg was a dream that only lasted two years. Schiller dreamed the same dream and was convinced that Germany would inevitably become a nation once a national theater was established.\n\nIn Germany, culture was not least compensation. When the many small German states could not find common ground in politics, Goethe's admiration was even greater for Lessing, who succeeded with his moral comedy _Minna von Barnhelm_ , \"a specifically north-German product, . . . in delighting the whole of Germany, uniting all Germans in conscious sympathy.\"17 When, once again, the Vienna Congress in 1815 failed to unite the many German states, \"those Germans who wanted unity looked increasingly to the formation of a cultural cohesion among their people, rather than to a political unity which seemed far distant.\"18 Shortly before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, Richard Wagner, in his essay on German art and politics, still had to evoke Lessing and Schiller when he wanted to talk about German experiences of achievement.19 Indifference to or disappointment with politics had less to do with German mentality than with German history. Indifference toward politics—understood as the collective will of the citizens to participate in the affairs of the _polis_ —became a mark of distinction for many who saw themselves as representatives of German culture. At times, it even seemed as if the German state was a state without politics, that is, a state with vassals but without citizens. Yet it never aimed at being a state without culture. In Germany, both nationalism and antinationalism could be characterized by a preponderance of cultural achievements. The finale of _The Mastersingers of_ _Nuremberg_ was proof of \"the intellectuality of Wagner's nationalism and its remoteness from the political sphere; . . . a complete anarchistic indifference to the state, so long as the spiritually German, the ' _Deutsche_ _Kunst_ ' survives.\"\n\nAs Fritz Stern has argued, the deliberate withdrawal from politics can be largely explained by the high premium placed on cultural preeminence and on the illiberal elitism that had prevailed in Germany since the time of Weimar classicism. Culture was the arena of the absolute, a realm without compromise. Its exaltation nourished the illusion that culture could be a substitute for power and therefore a substitute for politics.21 A considerable weakening of politics and of the public sphere was the result. Unlike \"civilization,\" \"culture\" has remained to this day a term that, in the German language, is almost naturally distant from, if not contrary to, politics. The connotation of \"culture\" is as positive, warm, and promising as that of \"politics\" is ambivalent, cold, and suspicious. Today the term \"Weimar Republic\" still suffers from linguistic bruises, whereas \"Weimar Culture\" is nostalgically remembered as a great promise that has remained largely unfulfilled. \"Bonn is not Weimar\" was the battle cry of the second German republic in the fifties, a political promise to do everything possible to fight political radicalism and ensure the stability of the democratic regime. Yet Berlin always felt flattered when the city was seen, decades after the end of the Second World War, as the place where elements of Weimar Culture had survived.\n\nThe distance between Potsdam, a symbol of Prussia's military might, and Weimar, the symbol of German culture, is not great. Looking at Germany's past and present confronted foreigners with a paradox. It was \"the co-existence through the centuries of a community almost slavishly docile to constituted authority and of a rich, critical, creative cultural life.\"\n\n_The German Spirit and the German Reich_\n\nOn October 4, 1914, ninety-three well-known, highly respected German intellectuals, scientists, writers, and artists—\"mandarins\" is the generic term Fritz Ringer has applied to them—published a manifesto addressed \"An die Kulturwelt\" (To the civilized world) in which they defended the actions of the Reich against criticism from abroad. The text of the manifesto had been drafted by a Jewish poet, Ludwig Fulda, who would commit suicide in 1939. The manifesto was, as Fritz Stern has described it, a moral declaration of war, a document of autistic arrogance. Germany was a peace-loving nation; the war had been imposed upon it. Germany had not violated the neutrality of Belgium; rather, the German army had anticipated and prevented Belgium's violation by French and English troops. Germany had not broken the rules of international law; on the contrary, it suffered much from the atrocities of its adversaries to the east and west. Most important, though, was the claim that the war against Germany was not, as the foreign propaganda would have it, a war against German militarism. It was above all a war against German culture—preposterously justified by the Liberal government in England as a war for civilization. The fight between British \"civilization\" and German \"Kultur\" became even more furious because there had been intellectual concord between Liberal Britain and prewar Germany.\n\nWhat was not understood abroad was that German militarism and German culture could not be separated from each other: \"Without German militarism German culture would already have disappeared from the soil of the earth.\" Statements like this were signed by the painter Max Liebermann, the liberal politician Friedrich Naumann, the professor of Romance languages Karl Vossler, and the psychologist Wilhelm Wundt, among many other unlikely names. The classicist Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Mollendorf even went so far as to declare that the fate not only of German but of European culture depended on the victory of German militarism. The signatories of the manifesto vowed that they would fight the war as members of a cultural people ( _Kulturvolk_ ) for whom the legacy of Goethe, Beethoven, and Kant was as sacred as German soil.24 T. S. Eliot was appalled that the Germans insisted that they were fighting a culture war; the \"normal\" war interested him much less and was no reason to get angry. He would fight not against German crimes but against German civilization, \"all this system of officers and professors.\"25 Eliot's letter, however, was not only ambiguous because he spoke of German civilization and not of German culture. After announcing that he would protest German civilization as represented by the system of officers and professors, he closed his letter with the ominous remark: \"But very useful to the world if kept in its place.\"\n\nMost of Germany's adversaries, however, declared they were fighting not the country of Goethe, Holderlin, and the brothers Humboldt, but a nation that was led by the Kaiser, Hindenburg, and Ludendorff. Yet it was not easy to separate the two Germanys. True, a German tradition that saw culture as naturally detached from politics lent itself to such a split. But this view had changed after the transition from a cultural to a political nationalism in the first half of the nineteenth century. Now politics was seen in Germany as the guarantor of culture, and culture provided politics with additional legitimacy. The French especially could not help but envy the coalition between the professor and the officer that had been victorious at Sedan in 1870. After the lost battles of Jena and Auerstedt in 1806, Prussia was the first European state to introduce compulsory military service as well as compulsory education.\n\nGerman soldiers had been able to defeat the French because they were disciplined and educated at the same time. There was nothing enigmatic about Germany's success: its source was the coalition between culture and politics. For Paul Valery, discipline was the most efficient German weapon. German intellectuals were as methodical as German generals.\n\nIronically enough, it was the founding of the German Empire that led Friedrich Nietzsche to insist on the split between politics and culture—for the sake of culture. At the start of the Franco-Prussian War, Nietzsche asked the University of Basel, where he had been appointed associate professor at the age of twenty-four a year earlier, for leave so that he could join the Prussian army. He enlisted as a medical assistant in August 1870. On July 19, Nietzsche had written to his mother that the French tiger was attacking German culture. To fight the tiger was worth any sacrifice. On the same day, however, Nietzsche struck a quite different note in a letter to the classicist Erwin Rhode in which he prophesied that the war would reveal how shaky the foundations of German culture really were. And in December 1870, again in a letter to his mother and sister, he admitted that his sympathies for the German war of conquest were rapidly dwindling. The French tiger was no longer threatening the survival of German culture. German culture was threatened above all by the coming Prussian victory.\n\nGermany's unity had been achieved not by politics but by culture. For a long time, the Germans were content to remain a _Kulturvolk_ whose self-esteem could not be lowered by the absence of a unified German state. For this self-sufficiency, they were admired not least by the French. With the Napoleonic conquests and the war of liberation, however, all this changed. Proud of officers like B lucher, Gneisenau, and Scharnhorst, the Germans became aware that culture had not been enough to defeat Napoleon. \"After 1815 the _Kulturvolk_ of Germany had to recognize that it could only compete in the harsh world of modern politics if it had the protection of a powerful state: if, from a _Kulturvolk_ , it became a _Kulturstaat_ ,\" as Hugh Trevor-Roper has put it. Similarly, Georg G. Iggers has described the transformation of German historical thought \"from Herder's cosmopolitan culture-oriented nationalism to the state-centered exclusive nationalism of the wars of liberation.\"28 The notion of a cultural state was as strange to the historian Jacob Burckhardt as it was to his colleague Friedrich Nietzsche. Burckhardt stubbornly refused to identify state and culture. \"Power, he believed, was separate from culture, could be hostile to it, had a momentum of its own, and was, in itself, evil.\" When the FrancoPrussian War broke out in 1870, Burckhardt predicted that culture would be the victim.\n\nNietzsche did the same. When the war of 1870–71 was won, he opposed the popular belief that, with the Prussian army, German culture had been victorious at Sedan. It was a dangerous delusion that would inevitably turn victory into the defeat, \"if not the extirpation, of the German spirit for the benefit of the 'German Reich.' \"30 From then on, the intricate relation between political success and cultural failure remained a leitmotif for Nietzsche. After the founding of the Reich, the Germans had become bored with the spirit: \"Politics swallows up all seriousness about really spiritual things.— _Deutschland, Deutschland_  _uber alles_ : I'm afraid that was the end of German philosophy.\" For Nietzsche, no true philosopher or poet could be found in Germany anymore but only a single outstanding individual whose political success had destroyed culture and had therefore, as an ironic compensation, turned politics into a work of art: Bismarck. His admirers called him a political sculptor and architect, or the Rembrandt of German politics.31 Nietzsche also came to despise Richard Wagner because Wagner had seen, at least for a while, the resurrection of the German empire as the prerequisite for the progress of German culture. Nietzsche anticipated a veneration of Bismarck that would survive well into the Weimar Republic, based above all on the delicate brutality with which the chancellor of the Reich was able to achieve his political goals. From the middle of the nineteenth century, German political thought was characterized by a conflict between idealism and realism, between a romantic yearning for morality in the public sphere and the deliberate refusal to let ethics enter the realm of politics. In Bismarck, these diverging attitudes were brought together: the Iron Chancellor was regarded as the model of the shrewd German politician in whom romantic sensibility became brutal, and whose cynicism was tempered with spirituality.

Institutions or characters, which are in\nthemselves consistent, probably gain by this method of proceeding,\nprovided the execution be not unworthy of the design. For it secures\ntheir exhibition in more, and more varied, points of view, than can\npossibly be covered by the more didactic process. But the possession of\nthis advantage depends upon the fact, that there is in them a harmony,\nwhich is their base, and which we have only to discover. Whereas, if\nthat harmony be wanting, if in lieu of it there be a groundwork of\nfundamental discrepancy, then the conditions of effect are wholly\nchanged. The multiplied variety of view becomes a multiplication\nof incongruity; each new aspect offers a new problem: and the more\nmasterly the hand of the artist, the more arduous becomes the attempt\nto comprehend and present in their mutual bearings the pictures he has\ndrawn, and the suggestions he has conveyed.\n\nThus it has been with that which, following German example, I have\ndenominated the Theo-mythology of Homer. By that term it seems not\nimproper to designate a mixture of theology and mythology, as these two\nwords are commonly understood. Theology I suppose to mean, a system\ndealing with the knowledge of God and the unseen world: mythology, a\nsystem conversant with the inventions of man concerning them. In the\nHomeric poems I find both of these largely displayed: but with this\ndifference, that the first was in visible decline, the second in such\nrapid and prolific development, that, while Homer is undoubtedly a\nwitness to older fable, which had already in his time become settled\ntradition, he is also in this department himself evidently and largely\na Maker and Inventor, and the material of the Greek mythology comes out\nof his hands far more fully moulded, and far more diversified, than it\nentered them.\n\nOf the fact that the Homeric religion does not present a consistent and\nhomogeneous whole, we have abundant evidence in the difficulties with\nwhich, so soon as the literary age of Greece began, expositors found\nthemselves incumbered; and which drove them sometimes upon allegory\nas a resource, sometimes, as in the case of Plato, upon censure and\nrepudiation[1].\n\n[1] Döllinger Heid. u. Jud. v. 1. p. 254.\n\n~_Extended relations of God to man._~\n\nI know not whether it has been owing to our somewhat narrow jealousies\nconcerning the function of Holy Scripture, or to our want of faith in\nthe extended Providence of God, and His manifestations in the world, or\nto the real incongruity in the evidence at our command, or to any other\ncause, but the fact, at least, seems to me beyond doubt, that our modes\nof dealing with the Homeric poems in this cardinal respect have been\neminently unsatisfactory. Those who have found in Homer the elements of\nreligious truth, have resorted to the far-fetched and very extravagant\nsupposition, that he had learned them from the contemporary Hebrews,\nor from the law of Moses. The more common and popular opinion[2] has\nperhaps been one, which has put all such elements almost or altogether\nout of view; one which has treated the Immortals in Homer as so many\nimpersonations of the powers of nature, or else magnified men, and\ntheir social life as in substance no more than as a reflection of his\npicture of heroic life, only gilded with embellishments, and enlarged\nin scale, in proportion to the superior elevation of its sphere. Few,\ncomparatively, have been inclined to recognise in the Homeric poems the\nvestiges of a real traditional knowledge, derived from the epoch when\nthe covenant of God with man, and the promise of a Messiah, had not yet\nfallen within the contracted forms of Judaism for shelter, but entered\nmore or less into the common consciousness, and formed a part of the\npatrimony of the human race[3].\n\n[2] See Heyne ad Il. i. 603; Terpstra, Antiquitas Homerica, i. 3. And\nso late as the Cambridge Essays 1856. p. 149.\n\n[3] See ‘Homerus, pt. i.’ by Archdeacon Williams: ‘Primitive\nTradition,’ 1843, by the same; Edinb. Rev. N^o. 155, art. Homerus, and\nthe reference, p. 50, to Cesarotti’s Ragionamento Storico-Critico.\n\nBut surely there is nothing improbable in the supposition, that in\nthe poems of Homer such vestiges may be found. Every recorded form of\nsociety bears some traces of those by which it has been preceded: and\nin that highly primitive form, which Homer has been the instrument\nof embalming for all posterity, the law of general reason obliges us\nto search for elements and vestiges belonging to one more primitive\nstill. And, if we are to inquire in the Iliad and the Odyssey for\nwhat belongs to antecedent manners and ideas, on what ground can it be\npronounced improbable, that no part of these earlier traditions should\nbe old enough to carry upon them the mark of belonging to the religion,\nwhich the Book of Genesis represents as brought by our first parents\nfrom Paradise, and as delivered by them to their immediate descendants\nin general? The Hebrew Chronology, considered in connection with the\nprobable date of Homer, would even render it difficult or irrational\nto proceed upon any other supposition: nor if, as by the Septuagint\nor otherwise, a larger period is allowed for the growth of our race,\nwill the state of this case be materially altered. For the facts must\nremain, that the form of society exhibited by Homer was itself in\nmany points essentially patriarchal, that it contains, in matter not\nreligious, such, for instance, as the episode of the Cyclops, clear\ntraces of a yet earlier condition yet more significant of a relation\nto that name, and that there is no broadly marked period of human\nexperience, or form of manners, which we can place between the great\ntrunk of human history in Holy Scripture, and this famed Homeric\nbranch, which of all literary treasures appears to be its eldest born.\nStanding next to the patriarchal histories of Holy Scripture, why\nshould it not bear, how can it not bear, traces of the religion under\nwhich the patriarchs lived?\n\nThe immense longevity of the early generations of mankind was eminently\nfavourable to the preservation of pristine traditions. Each individual,\ninstead of being as now a witness of, or an agent in, one or two\ntransmissions from father to son, would observe or share in ten times\nas many. According to the Hebrew Chronology, Lamech the father of\nNoah was of mature age before Adam died: and Abraham was of mature\nage before Noah died. Original or early witnesses, remaining so long\nas standards of appeal, would evidently check the rapidity of the\ndarkening and destroying process.\n\nLet us suppose that man now lived but twenty years, instead of\nfourscore. Would not this greatly quicken the waste of ancient\ntraditions? And is not the converse also true?\n\n~_Sufficiently proved from Holy Scripture._~\n\nCustom has made it with us second nature to take for granted a\nbroad line of demarcation between those who live within the pale of\nRevelation, and the residue of mankind. But Holy Scripture does not\nappear to recognise such a severance in any manner, until we come to\nthe revelation of the Mosaic law, which was like the erection of a\ntemporary shelter for truths that had ranged at large over the plain,\nand that were apparently in danger of being totally absorbed in the\nmass of human inventions. But before this vineyard was planted, and\nlikewise outside its fence, there were remains, smaller or greater,\nof the knowledge of God; and there was a recognised relation between\nJehovah and mankind, which has been the subject of record from time to\ntime, and the ground of acts involving the admonition, or pardon, or\ncorrection, or destruction, of individuals or communities.\n\nThe latest of these indications, such as the visit of the Wise Men from\nthe East, are not the most remarkable: because first the captivity in\nBabylon, and subsequently the dissemination of Jewish groups through so\nmany parts of the world, could not but lead to direct communications\nof divine knowledge, at least, in some small degree. From such causes,\nthere would be many a Cornelius before him who became the first-fruits\nof the Gentiles. Yet even the interest, which probably led to such\ncommunications from the Jew, must have had its own root in relics of\nprior tradition, which attested the common concern of mankind in Him\nthat was to come. But in earlier times, and when the Jewish nation\nwas more concentrated, and was certainly obscure, the vestiges of\nextra-patriarchal and extra-judaical relations between God and man\nare undeniable. They have been traced with clearness and ability in a\npopular treatise by the hand of Bishop Horsley[4].\n\n[4] Horsley’s Dissertation on the Prophecies of the Messiah dispersed\namong the heathen. See also Mr. Harvey’s Observations on the Gnostic\nSystem, pp. iii and seqq., prefixed to his S. Irenæus, Cambridge, 1857.\nWilliams’s Primitive Tradition, p. 9.\n\nLet us take, for instance, that case of extreme wickedness, which most\nseverely tries the general proposition. The punishment of Sodom and\nGomorrah for their sins was preceded by a declaration from the Most\nHigh, importing a direct relation with those guilty cities[5]; and two\nangels, who had visited Abraham on the plains of Mamre, ‘came to Sodom\nat even.’ Ruth the Moabitess was an ancestress, through king David,\nof our Lord. Rahab in Jericho, ‘by faith,’ as the Apostle assures us,\nentertained the spies of the Israelites. Job, living in a country\nwhere the worship of the sun was practised, had, as had his friends,\nthe knowledge of the true God. Melchizedek, the priest of On, whose\ndaughter Joseph married, and Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, are\nother conspicuous instances. Later in time, Nineveh, the great Assyrian\ncapital, received the message of the prophet Jonah, and repented at his\npreaching. Here the teaching organ was supplied from among the Jews:\nbut Balaam exhibits to us the gift of inspiration beyond their bounds.\nOnce more; many centuries after the Homeric manners had disappeared,\nand during the captivity, we find not only a knowledge of God, but\ndreams and signs vouchsafed to Assyrian kings, and interpreted for\nthem by the prophet Daniel. We have, in short, mingling with the whole\ncourse of the Old Testament, a stream of evidence which shows the\npartial remnants of the knowledge of God, apart from that main current\nof it which is particularly traced for us in the patriarchal and\nMosaic histories. Again, many centuries after Homer, when all traces\nof primitive manners had long vanished, still in the Prometheus of\nÆschylus, and in the Pollio of Virgil, we have signs, though I grant\nthey are faint ones, that the celestial rays had not even then ‘faded\ninto the light of common day’ for the heathen world. It would really\nbe strange, and that in a high degree, if a record like that of Homer,\nwith so many resemblances to the earliest manners in other points, had\nno link to connect it with them in their most vital part.\n\n[5] See Genesis xviii. 1, 20. xx. 1. Heb. xi. 31.\n\n~_The question one of history._~\n\nThe general proposition, that we may expect to find the relics of\nScriptural traditions in the heroic age of Greece, though it leads,\nif proved, to important practical results, is independent even of a\nbelief in those traditions, as they stand in the scheme of revealed\ntruth. They must be admitted to have been facts on earth, even by those\nwho would deny them to be facts of heavenly origin, in the shape in\nwhich Christendom receives them: and the question immediately before\nus is one of pure historical probability. The descent of mankind from\na single pair, the lapse of that pair from original righteousness,\nare apart from and ulterior to it. We have traced the Greek nation\nto a source, and along a path of migration, which must in all\nlikelihood have placed its ancestry, at some point or points, in close\nlocal relations with the scenes of the earliest Mosaic records: the\nretentiveness of that people equalled its receptiveness, and its close\nand fond association with the past made it prone indeed to incorporate\nnovel matter into its religion, but prone also to keep it there after\nits incorporation.\n\nIf such traditions existed, and if the laws which guide historical\ninquiry require or lead us to suppose that the forefathers of the\nGreeks must have lived within their circle, then the burden of proof\nmust lie not so properly with those who assert that the traces of them\nare to be found in the earliest, that is, the Homeric, form of the\nGreek mythology, as with those who deny it. What became of those old\ntraditions? They must have decayed and disappeared, not by a sudden\nprocess, but by a gradual accumulation of the corrupt accretions, in\nwhich at length they were so completely interred as to be invisible\nand inaccessible. Some period therefore there must have been, at which\nthey would remain clearly perceptible, though in conjunction with much\ncorrupt matter. Such a period might be made the subject of record, and\nif such there were, we might naturally expect to find it in the oldest\nknown work of the ancient literature.\n\nIf the poems of Homer do, however, contain a picture, even though a\ndefaced picture, of the primeval religious traditions, it is obvious\nthat they afford a most valuable collateral support to the credit of\nthe Holy Scripture, considered as a document of history. Still we must\nnot allow the desire of gaining this advantage to bias the mind in an\ninquiry, which can only be of value if it is conducted according to the\nstrictest rules of rational criticism.\n\n~_Invention combined with tradition._~\n\nWe may then, in accordance with those rules, be prepared to expect\nthat the Hellenic religion will prove to have been in part constructed\nfrom traditional knowledge. The question arises next, Of what other\nmaterials in addition was it composed? The answer can be but one;\nSuch materials would be supplied by invention. But invention cannot\nabsolutely create; it can only work upon what it finds already provided\nto its hand. The provision made in this instance was simply that with\nwhich the experience of man supplied him. It was mediate or immediate:\nmediate, where the Greek received matter from abroad, and wrought upon\nit: immediate, where he conceived it for himself. That experience lay\nin two spheres--the sphere of external nature, and the sphere of life.\nEach of these would afford for the purpose the elements of Power,\nGrandeur, Pleasure, Beauty, Utility; and such would be the elements\nsuited to the work of constructing or developing a system that was to\npresent objects for his worship. We may therefore reasonably expect\nto find in the religion features referable to these two departments\nfor their origin;--first, the powerful forces and attractive forms of\noutward nature; secondly, the faculties and propensities of man, and\nthose relations to his fellow-men, amidst which his lot is cast, and\nhis character formed.\n\nIf this be so, then, in the result thus compounded out of tradition\npurporting to be revealed, and out of invention strictly human, we\nought to recognise, so long as both classes of ingredients are in\neffective coexistence, not strictly a false theology, but a true\ntheology falsified: a true religion, into which falsehood has entered,\nand in which it is gradually overlaying and absorbing the original\ntruth, until, when the process has at length reached a certain point,\nit is wholly hidden and borne down by countervailing forces, so that\nthe system has for practical purposes become a false one, and both may\nand should be so termed and treated.\n\nI admit that very different modes of representing the case have been\nin vogue. Sometimes by those to whom the interest of Christianity\nis precious, and sometimes in indifference or hostility to its\nfortunes, it is held that the basis of the Greek mythology is laid in\nthe deification of the powers of nature. The common assumptions have\nbeen such as the following: That the starting-point of the religion\nof the heroic age is to be sought only in the facts of the world, in\nthe ideas and experience of man. That nature-worship, the deification\nof elemental and other physical powers, was the original and proper\nbasis of the system. That this system, presumably self-consistent,\nas having been founded on a given principle, was broken up by the\nintervention of theogonic revolutions. That the system, of which\nJupiter was at the head, was an imperfect reconstruction of a scheme of\ndivine rule out of the fragments of an earlier religion, and that it\nsupplanted the elder gods. In short, the Greek mythology is represented\nas a corrupt edition, not of original revealed religion, but of a\nNature-worship which, as it seems to be assumed, was separated by a\ngulf never measured, and never passed, from the primitive religious\ntraditions of our race. Further it seems to be held, that the faults\nand imperfections of the pagan religion have their root only in a\nradical inability of the human mind to produce pure deity; that they do\nnot represent the depravation of an ancient and divine gift, but rather\nthe simple failure of man in a work of invention. Indeed, we need not\nwonder that it should fail in a process which, critically considered,\ncan mean little else than mere exaggeration of itself and from its own\nexperience[6], and which must be so apt to become positive caricature.\n\n[6] See Nägelsbach, Homerische Theologie, i. 1. ii. 1. Also (if I\nunderstand it rightly), Döllinger’s Heidenthum und Judenthum, ii. 1. §.\n1. p. 54.\n\n~_The basis was not in Nature-worship._~\n\nAgain, Dean Prideaux, in his Connection of Sacred and Profane History,\ngives the following genesis of the Greek mythology. From the beginning,\nhe says, there was a general notion among men, founded on a sense that\nthey were impure, of the necessity of a mediator with God. There being\nno mediator clearly revealed, man chose mediators for himself, and took\nthe sun, moon, and stars, as high intelligences well fitted for the\npurpose. Hence we find Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Apollo, Mercury, Venus,\nand Diana, to be first ranked in the polytheism of the ancients: for\nthey were their first gods[7].\n\n[7] Prideaux, i. 3. vol. i. p. 198.\n\nThis theory is not in correspondence with the facts of the heroic age.\nThere is no sense whatever of an impurity disabling men from access\nto God; no clear or general opinion of the necessity of mediation; no\nglimpse even of a god superior to Jupiter and the rest with whom they\nwere on behalf of man to mediate.\n\nAnd, again, the opinion, that the origin of the religion lay in\nNature-worship, has had the support both of high and also of recent\nauthorities. The eminent and learned Dr. Döllinger, in his ‘Heidenthum\nund Judenthum,’ says, that the deification of Nature, its forces,\nor the particular objects it offered to the senses, constituted the\ngroundwork of the Greek, as well as of the other heathen religions. The\nidea of God continued to be powerful even when it had been darkened,\nand the godhead was felt as present, and active everywhere in the\nphysical order. In working out his general rule for each mythological\ndeity in particular, this author conceives the original form of their\nexistence to have been that of a Nature-power, even where the vestiges\nof such a conception have, under subsequent handling, become faint\nor imperceptible. Thus Juno, Minerva, Latona, Diana, and others in\nsuccession, are referred to such an origin[8].\n\n[8] Heidenthum und Judenthum, b. ii. sect. 1, 2. pp. 54-81.\n\nNow in dealing with this hypothesis, I would ask, what then has become\nof the old Theistic and Messianic traditions? and how has it happened\nthey have been amputated by a process so violent as to make them to\nleave, even while the state of society continued still primitive, no\ntrace behind them? But further. I would urge with confidence that the\nample picture of the religion of the heroic ages, as we have it in\nHomer, which is strictly for this purpose in the nature of a fact,\ncannot be made to harmonize with the hypothesis which refers it to\nsuch a source. The proof of this statement must depend mainly on the\nexamination which we have to institute in detail: but I am anxious\nat once to bring it into view, and to refer briefly to some of the\ngrounds on which it rests, because it is susceptible of demonstration\nby evidence as contradistinguished from theory. On the other hand,\nwhen I proceed farther, evidence and theory must of necessity be mixed\nup together; and dissent from a particular mode of tracing out the\nassociation between the traditional and inventive elements of the\nsystem might unawares betray the reader into the conclusion, that no\nsuch distinct traditional elements were to be found, but that all,\nor nearly all, was pure fable. I say, then, there is much in the\ntheo-mythology of Homer, which, if it had been a system founded in\nfable, could not have appeared there. It stands before us like one of\nour old churches, having different parts of its fabric in the different\nstyles of architecture, each of which speaks for itself, and which we\nknow to belong to the several epochs in the history of the art, when\ntheir characteristic combinations were respectively in vogue.\n\n~_Nor is the system from invention only._~\n\nWhile on the one hand it has deities, such as Latona, without any\nattributes at all, on the other hand, we find in it both gods and\ngoddesses, with an assemblage of such attributes and functions as have\nno common link by which invention could have fastened them together.\nThey are such, likewise, as to bring about cross divisions and cross\npurposes, that the Greek force of imagination, and the Greek love of\nsymmetry, would have alike eschewed. How could invention have set\nup Pallas as the goddess at once of peace and its industries, of\nwisdom, and of war? Its object would clearly have been to impersonate\nattributes; and to associate even distinct, much less conflicting\nattributes, in the same deity, would have been simply to confuse them.\nHow again could it have combined in Apollo, who likewise turns the\ncourses of rivers by his might, the offices of destruction, music,\npoetry, prophecy, archery, and medicine? Again, if he is the god of\nmedicine, why have we Paieon? if of poetry, why have we the Muses? If\nMinerva be (as she is) goddess of war, why have we Mars? if of the work\nof the Artificer, why have we also Vulcan? if of prudence and sagacity,\nand even craft[9], why Mercury?\n\n[9] Il. xxii. 247.\n\nAnd again, the theory is, that the chief personages of the mythology\nare representatives of the great powers of the physical universe. I\nask, therefore, how it happens that in the Homeric, or, as we may call\nit, primitive form of the system, these great powers of the universe\nare for the most part very indistinctly and partially personified,\nwhereas we see in vivid life and constant movement another set of\nfigures, having either an obscure or partial relation, or no relation\nat all, to those powers? Such a state of the evidence surely strikes\nat the very root of the hypothesis we are considering: but it is\nthe state of the evidence which we actually find before us. Take for\ninstance Time, Ocean, Earth, Sun, Moon, Stars, Air; all these prime\nnatural objects and agents are either not personified at all in Homer,\nor so indistinctly and mutely personified that they are the mere\nzoophytes of his supernatural world, of which the gorgeous life and\nbrilliant movement are sustained by a separate set of characters.\nOf these more effective agents, some are such as it is impossible\nrationally to set down for mere impersonations of ideas; while others\nare plainly constituted as lords over, and not beings derivative from,\nthose powers or provinces of nature, with which they are placed in\nspecial relations. It cannot for instance rationally be said that the\nHomeric Jupiter is a mere impersonation of the air which he rules, or\nthe Homeric Neptune of the sea, or the Homeric Aidoneus (or Aides) of\nthe nether world. For to the first of these three, many functions are\nassigned having no connection with the air. As for example, when he\ngives swiftness of foot to Æneas on Mount Ida, that he might escape\nthe pursuit of Achilles[10]. In the case of the second, there is a\nrival figure, namely, Nereus, who never that we know of leaves the sea,\nwho is the father of the Sea-nymphs, and who evidently fulfils the\nconditions of Sea impersonated far better than does Neptune; Neptune,\nwho marched upon the battle-field in Troas, and who, with Apollo, had\nhimself built the walls of Ilium. Besides all this, the sea, to which\nNeptune belongs, is itself not one of the great elemental powers of\nthe universe, but is derived, like rivers, springs, and wells, from\nFather Ocean, who fears indeed the thunderbolt of Jupiter, but is not\nbound to attendance even in the great chapter of Olympus[11]. As\nto Aidoneus, he can hardly impersonate the nether world, because in\nHomer he does not represent or govern it, but only has to do with that\nportion of it, which is inhabited by the souls of departed men. For,\nas far beneath his realm as Earth is beneath Heaven, lies the dark\nTartarus of Homer, peopled with Κρόνος and his Titans. Nor, on the\nother hand, do we know that the Elysian fields of the West were subject\nto his sway. The elemental powers are in Homer, though not altogether,\nyet almost altogether, extrinsic to his grand Olympian system.\n\n[10] Il. xx. 92.\n\n[11] Il. xxi. 195-9. xx. 7.\n\nWithout, then, anticipating this or that particular result from\nthe inquiry into the mode and proportions in which traditional and\ninventive elements are combined in the poems of Homer, it may safely\nbe denied that his picture of the supernatural world could have been\ndrawn by means of materials exclusively supplied by invention from the\nsources of nature and experience.\n\n~_Traditive origin of Sacrifice._~\n\nAnd indeed there is one particular with respect to which the admission\nwill be generally made, that the Greek mythological system stood\nindebted at least to a primitive tradition, if not to a direct command;\nI mean the institution of sacrifice. This can hardly be supposed to\nhave been an original conception in every country; and it distinctly\npoints us to one common source. Sacrifice was, according\n", "final_result_str": "repair", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "4a86bce0-50cf-4879-b5bd-7a352e294f1c", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "need_repair", "evidence": "前置目录书籍"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "ae897756-1e35-496f-ad77-614855a08bb1", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "正常的小说内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "2dd47550-6ca5-44ac-8e33-af3a3cda1c25", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "书"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "e20c55b8-7fab-4cdb-bc80-0afa9d3d8db3", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 知识性内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

The result for Starkweather was a full-on new business plan and pitch that has been updated to reflect all the lessons learned, all the new resources that are available, and the forecast of where the industry and consumer behavior is going in the future.\nThe capstone event gave me a platform to share those organized thoughts to a group of intelligent, curious professionals who then had an opportunity to come speak with the founder (myself), see the products, try them on, and share their feedback. I walked away inspired with new ideas, and excited to get the product into waiting customers' hands. That excitement will serve me well, as motivation and foundation to overcome the challenges to come. Truth: the hard work begins now.\nWriting this on a 30º day in mid-April, I know even as I wait for the warm weather to come, that getting cold-weather product to market for fall 2018 will keep me occupied until the weather turns cold again.\nOver the next several months, I will be getting the word out, taking lots of meetings and copious notes, and building out the resources to make the Fall's launch a catalyst for Starkweather's future success.\nThank you to Charles and Elizabeth @LostArts, and to the rest of the cohort founders.\n2018/1 Cohort Companies:\nCoLab\nFounded by Louis Vowell, CoLab is an online collaboration platform that connects artists and alumni from different art universities across the country.

They play little role in the anti-intellectualist arguments of various kinds in the papers collected in Bengson and Moffett (2011). They are used as something like target practice by intellectualists like Jason Stanley (2011), who uses the first chapter of his book to dispose of them before getting onto the real business. And even Yuri Cath, who in other work has launched sharp critiques of intellectualism, has argued that the regress arguments for anti-intellectualism don't work (Cath, 2011, 2013). The majority view seems to be that Carl Ginet (1975) basically showed these arguments didn't work, and it's time to move onto other considerations for or against intellectualism. I think this isn't exactly right. In particular, I think regress arguments can be used to show a few different things. For one, they can be used to refute a precisification of this thesis, which plays a key role in some intellectualist arguments. • Only volitional actions are normatively assessable. Once we have seen that thesis is false, we need a new picture of how action can be at once intelligent and non-volitional. Some considerations similar to those adduced by Ryle (1949) concerning agents who either concentrate on irrelevant considerations, or ignore relevant ones, show there is a role for intellectual skill that cannot be identified with any piece of knowledge that. And some further considerations, similar to those adduced by Cath (2011), suggest that this intellectual skill can't even be constituted by a piece of knowledge that. So regress arguments, I'll argue, can do quite a lot to motivate the thought that there was a lot wrong with the intellectual picture Ryle tried to attack. The position I'm going to be defending is a long way from the strongest kinds of Rylean position that contemporary intellectualists such as Stanley are focussed on arguing against. My focus is primarily on intellectual skill. This has some relevance for debates about know how, though less relevance for debates about the semantics of know how ascriptions. This focus on skill rather than know how ascriptions is hardly novel; it is continuing a trend that we see exemplified in recent work by, inter alia, Carlotta Pavese (2013), Ellen Fridland (2014) and Cheng-Hung Tsai (2014). And in fact that conclusions I'll draw here are, I think, similar to the ones that Fridland draws. Once we move towards thinking about skill, we can get varieties of anti-intellectualism that are very different from those that were the focus of most philosophical Intellectual Skill 2 discussion until very recently. For example, the anti-intellectualist view I'm defending is consistent with the following four theses. • Instances of intellectual skill are usually, and perhaps always, not happily reported using know how ascriptions. • Know how ascriptions are rarely, if ever, reports of intellectual skill, and are frequently reports of propositional knowledge. • Intellectual skill is guided by, and dependent on, propositional knowledge. • Propositional knowledge is not behaviourally inert. Not just is the view consistent with these four, I'm fairly confident that the last three at least are true. But that's all consistent with the view that intellectual skill is not itself propositional knowledge. And it's all consistent with the view that we can learn philosophically significant conclusions from Ryle's regress arguments. One disclaimer before I start. Although this paper is heavily influenced by Ryle (1945, 1949), and sympathetic interpreters of Ryle such as Jennifer Hornsby (2011), I make no attempt at Ryle exegesis here. I think there's a decent case to be made that Ryle was sympathetic to the position defended here, but I'm going to leave that debate for another day. 1 The Volitional Regress Define a volitional action to be one that is preceeded by a volition to perform that very action. And say an action is normatively assessable if it can properly be assessed using terms like praiseworthy, blameworthy, intelligent or stupid. Note that I'm ruling out assessments as good or bad as versions of normative assessment, in the relevant sense. Someone who has a good digestive system is not, thereby, normatively assessable in the stipulative sense I'm using. Both of these definitions are to an extent stipulative; the terms 'volitional' and 'normative' can sensibly receive many other definitions. Still, I will stick to these definitions here. In light of those stipulations, consider the following set of propositions. 1. Only volitional actions are normatively assessable. 2. The action of forming a volition is normatively assessable. 3. Some public actions, such as making a move in a chess game, are normatively assessable. It should be obvious that this leads to a regress. Whether the kind of regress in question is impossible, or even impractical, is a tricky question. (See Robert K. Meyer (1987) for some of the complications that arise when trying to reason about Intellectual Skill 3 regresses.) But it is commonly assumed in this literature that the kind of regress that these three premises lead to is problematic. Since the third premise is obviously true, the issue is whether the first or second is false. But it seems that second is true as well. Just as we can assess a person's actions as praise or blameworthy, intelligent or stupid, we can assess the process by which she decided to perform those actions in the same way. Consider two people who make the same, as it turns out great, chess move in the same situation. The first notices an initially appealing counter to her move, and sees after careful thought that it won't work. The second simply doesn't notice the counter, and is stumped when her opponent makes it. It seems the first has engaged in a more intelligent practice of volition formation than the second. Or imagine a third player, whose initial analysis of the move starts by considering a recipe for arroz con leche. Unless there turns out to be an unnoticed connection here, this looks even less intelligent than the second player. On the other hand, the first premise is rather unintuitive. To borrow an example from Angela Smith (2005), it is blameworthy to forget a friend's birthday, although forgettings are rarely volitional. So we must reject 1 or 2, and while 1 is subject to independent counterexample, 2 seems independently plausible. So 1 must be false.1 That's already a substantial conclusion. Something like 1 is behind William Alston's famous, and influential, arguments against deontological approaches to epistemology (Alston, 1988). But the negation of 1 is not a novel claim; I'm saying nothing here that Smith didn't say in her rejection of the \"volitional view of responsibility\" (Smith, 2005, 238). And similar views have been put forward by other critics of Alston such as Sharon Ryan (2003) and Matthias Steup (2008). But still, the fact that 1 is false seems not to have been sufficiently appreciated in the recent literature on intellectualism. To see one place where it is relevant, consider this set of propositions, which also seem to trigger a regress. 4. Intelligent action requires the triggering of a prior representation of knowledge relevant to the action. 5. The triggering of a representation, when done well, is an intelligent action. 6. Some public actions, such as making a move in a chess game, are intelligent. Again, these propositions obviously trigger a regress, and that seems like good evidence to take one of them to be false. This is very similar to one of the regresses Jason Stanley considers in chapter 2 of his (2011). And Stanley thinks the false 1This argument is obviously rather quick, and I doubt will persuade someone already convinced of 1. For much more extensive arguments against 1, see the Smith, Ryan and Steup articles cited in the text, plus Adams (1985). Intellectual Skill 4 proposition is 5. He writes \"Triggering a representation can be done poorly or well. But this does not show it can be done intelligently or stupidly.\" (Stanley, 2011, 16) Indeed, he writes that since \"triggering representations is something we do automatically\" (Stanley, 2011, 16) a statement like 5 is a \"manifest implausibility\" (Stanley, 2011, 16). But the argument here relies on 1. If you think things done non-volitionally can be intelligent or stupid, it isn't too much of a stretch to think that things done automatically can be intelligent or stupid. Indeed, Smith's birthday example is already enough to undermine Stanley's point; forgetting a friend's birthday seems automatic in the sense he has in mind, but is also stupid. More generally, it seems very intuitive to describe everyday cases in such a way that 5 must be true. For example, Billy asks Suzy whether she thinks Jill's party will be a success. There are a lot of things that are common knowledge between the two of them. One is that Jill is a proficient party host. Another is that Jill has invited all of their colleagues, including Jack. Another is that parties which Jack attends are rarely successes. But Suzy thinks for a minute, remembers that Jack is away in Ohio, and says that it will be a success. It was smart of Suzy to think about Jack's whereabouts. It wasn't, perhaps, necessary. If she'd just reasoned from Jill's general proficiency to the success of the party, she would have got to the right conclusion. But it was better to note a possible complication, and check that it wouldn't actually get in the way. It would have been stupid to perform the same activity for many other kinds of possible complications. If Suzy had thought to herself, \"The party will be a disaster if there's an alien invasion in the middle of it, but there's no reason to think the aliens will invade just now, so I'll keep on thinking it will be a success,\" that would have been stupid. Other possible complications are not stupid to consider, but they are intellectual mistakes. The party won't be a success if there's a police raid in the middle, based on a mistaken view the police have about where a particular drug dealer lives. Police do make mistakes, so even if Jill isn't a drug dealer, this could be a genuine concern, depending on how nearby the mistakes are. But if the nearest mistake was a botched raid in a neighbouring state in the previous year, it's wrong for Suzy to worry about this before answering Billy's question. Stanley's view has to be that I've been misusing adjectives systematically through the last two paragraphs. I shouldn't have said that it was smart of Suzy to consider Jack's whereabouts, or that it would have been stupid to consider the alien invasion. Rather, it was just her cognitive system working well when she considered Jack, and would have been working poorly had she considered the aliens, and sub-optimally had she considered the police. This doesn't seem at all the natural way to describe the case to me, in part because I'm not sure I see the difference Stanley is hinting Intellectual Skill 5 at. Intelligence just is the good operation of the cognitive system, and stupidity its poor operation. So these two regresses lead to two interesting conclusions. First, some nonvolitional actions are normatively assessable. Second, intelligent action does not always require the prior triggering of a representation of relevant knowledge. Both of these are interesting. Both of these are negations of part of what you might consider \"the intellectualist picture\". (Cath (2013) notes that Ryle often refers to the regresses as arguments against this picture, not against any particular thesis.) But neither of them get us very close to a distinction between know how and know that, or between intellectual skill and know that. The next section addresses some ways we might move closer to arguments against more central intellectualist claims. 2 Picturing Intelligent Action As noted in the introduction, my plan is not to offer an argument with regress like premises, and the conclusion that intellectual skill is distinct from propositional knowledge, or that know how is distinct from propositional knowledge. What I do want to do is sketch a picture of human intelligence (at a very high level of generality) that presupposes that intellectual skill is not identical to propositional knowledge, and suggest some considerations to the effect that no similarly plausible picture exists in which intellectual skill and propositional knowledge are identified. The thought here is not that the only way out of the regress involves distinguishing skill and knowledge – and perhaps distinguishing know how from know that – but rather that the best way out does. Start with a well known, if not obviously authentic, exchange.2 Oscar Wilde: I wish I'd said that. James McNeill Whistler: You will Oscar; you will. Assuming this really happened, that's a clever response. It's an occupational hazard of philosophers to think that the ability to come up with quick, clever responses is somehow central to intelligence. But we can reject that wildly implausible view without thinking that it's wrong to think of these quips as a manifestation of a kind of intelligence. 2I thought this example was purely fictional, coming from the Monty Python sketch reproduced in Dempsey (2012, p. 741). But Ben Wolfson pointed out to me that it's recorded as a true story in Hadley (1903, p. 255). It's actually striking how few really good off-the-cuff quips there are in recorded history. The famous one attributed to Wilde, \"I have nothing to declare but my genius\", is probably apocryphal, and in any case sounds prepared. Lists of famous come-backs and ripostes are usually crowded with written responses. Word play is hard. Intellectual Skill 6 Now let's think of how someone could have come up with this response. Even before we start researching the neural patterns behind quips like this, we can be pretty sure the following is not what happened in Whistler's brain. He first made an exhaustive list of all possible responses, from \"Green ideas sleep furiously\" to what he actually said, then figured out which would be best, then produced the best one. On this wildly implausible model, the reply would be intelligent because it would reflect the speaker's ability to properly evaluate this list of responses. That's implausible because the list is simply too big. Indeed, it is in principle infinitely large. The list is too big to survey not just consciously, but subconsciously. Coming up with a response like this requires first coming up with a narrower list of possible responses, and then evaluating which is best from that list.3 There's a romantic model of intellect where the list in question consists of just the reply actually issued. On this model the perfect reply appears fully and perfectly formed in the mind of the intelligent person. Now such a model may often fit the phenomenology, but I don't think we should give that much credit. It's an empirical question how many possible replies are represented in the mind in a situation like this, before the chosen reply is issued. What's not an empirical issue is whether the list of possible replies that is represented in the mind is finite or infinite. It simply must be finite, which means that there must be better and worse lists to consider. And that suggests that there is some skill involved in coming up with the list. One could reject this last conclusion. One could try saying that the coming up with a list of possible replies is no manifestation of skill, but the skill is only involved in the evaluation and selection of replies. But this seems to generate a bizarre explanation about why the less skilled interlocutor comes up with worse replies. The model, presumably, is that the lack of skill does not explain having the wrong list of replies to choose between. Rather, what explains their less skilled reply must simply be that they misevaluated the possible replies. But that doesn't fit the observed data. It's much easier to see of someone else's reply that it was clever than it is to come up with a clever reply. It could also be objected that the model I've suggested is much too simple. It isn't just that the mind issues a list of options, then evaluates them, and then selects the best. A more plausible model involves more recursive steps. The mind first generates a list of options, selects the best, then generates a list of refinements of that best option, selects the best of those, and so on. Perhaps when we consider superficial forms of intelligence, such as quips, it makes sense to consider a 'onestep' model, where a list is generated and evaluated, followed by a speech. But when 3Or, perhaps even more plausibly, coming up with a short list of possible openings, choosing the best, and doing what one can to figure out how to complete the response while uttering the start of it. Thanks here to Ben Wolfson. Intellectual Skill 7 one is choosing one's words carefully, as in say Wilde's writing, the simple model I've described feels much too simple. But although the simple model is too simple for considered writing, the general structure must be right. Even a writer working at a leisurely pace, such as Joyce taking decades to write Finnegans Wake, doesn't have time to consider, even subconsciously, all possible constructions. There are still too many. And nor is it true that the difference between Joyce's skill and ours is that he realises the value of the sentences we all represent. The rest of us didn't simply misjudge the value of \"Nobirdy aviar soar anywing to eagle it\" (Joyce, 1939/2012, p. 505); we simply didn't token it. The ability to token mental representations like that is part of what Joyce's genius consists in. I've focussed so far on cases where it is a priori implausible that human thinkers start by surveying the range of possible things they could do. It is also interesting to look at cases where this is in principle possible, but doesn't seem to happen in practice. There have been, traditionally, major differences in the style of play between human and computer chess players. (Since so many young players learn from machines these days, Kasparov (2010) suggests these differences are diminishing.4) This isn't necessarily because humans can't consider all options on the chess board. Usually there will be fewer than a hundred available moves, and a human could consider each. But that isn't, it seems, how humans think. They don't allocate equal resources to working through each of the possible options. As a result, computers often come up with surprising kinds of moves. Now computers are actually very good at chess, so these pre-deliberative allocations of cognitive resources may not have been optimal. Perhaps it would have been better for traditional chess players to spend more time thinking through unlikely progressions of the game. But it is evidence that even when we could use an unintelligent method for beginning inquiry, namely recursively generating the possible options, we prefer to use intelligent methods. So intelligent action, at least in humans in the kinds of situations humans normally find themselves in, consists in part of making intelligent choices about where to start inquiry. Given that intelligent action need not be volitional, as we established above, it isn't surprising that being intelligent consists in part in starting in the right places. But perhaps this intelligence is just itself a kind of knowledge. It is, we might suspect, just the knowledge of what a good starting point will be. Or, since we will want to start with all and only the considerations relevant to a given inquiry, it is just knowledge of what is relevant. The resulting picture is both perfectly intellectualist, and immune to the regresses considered above. The intelligent person knows what is relevant to what 4Thanks to Bernard Kobes and John Collins for helpful discussions about the chess examples. Intellectual Skill 8 inquiry. Her choice of starting points is guided by this knowledge. (The 'guidance' metaphor recurs frequently in Stanley's work.) This isn't because it leads to a volition to start just here. Such a volition would be self-defeating, since in the relevant sense of 'start', by the time this volition is formed, one has already started, and indeed started elsewhere. Nor can she be guided by even a triggered representation of this knowledge of relevance. Again, if that happens, she is in the relevant sense starting elsewhere. But perhaps propositional knowledge can guide directly; not by generating volitions, and without even being represented anew. Now I don't think this picture is right. But it isn't incoherent either, and it takes work to see why it isn't right. One bad argument against this picture starts with the idea that skills are active, while knowledge is passive. The thought is that the person who knows a lot is like the Tortoise in Louis Carroll's dialogue (Carroll, 1895), only able to add more premises but never to reach a conclusion. It is only with skill that we can get to the conclusion. Stanley rightly objects to this argument on the grounds that it just isn't true that knowledge is passive in the relevant sense. We should not, as Stanley puts it, \"over-intellectualize knowing that\". (Stanley, 2012, p. 773). (A similar point is made in Stalnaker (2012).) Knowing that p is not just a matter of having p written in a knowledge box somewhere in the brain; it can in part be constituted by active dispositions. A better argument looks at the very different modal profiles of intellectual skill and knowledge of relevance. Someone can know that something is irrelevant and yet lack the skill to ignore it; or they can know that something is relevant and yet lack the skill to consider it in a timely manner. Examples from the other direction, where there is skill without knowledge, are a little more contentious, but we'll look at some possible cases of those too. But first we'll run through two examples to show how easy it is to have knowledge without skill. Alice has spent a lot of money on video-conferencing equipment. But it isn't working at all well, and she now has to decide whether to try and patch it into something better, or buy a whole new system. She knows the sunk cost fallacy is a fallacy; that buying a new system would make the previous purchases a waste is no reason to not buy a new system, especially if doing so is good value compared to the cost of buying a 'patch'. But she can't bring herself to ignore this fact when deliberating. Even though she eventually makes the right decision and buys new equipment, she takes much longer about this than she would have if, say, the existing equipment was old enough that she could easily conceptualise it as obsolete. Bob is trying to solve a puzzle about the properties of functions from rationals to rationals. He knows that it is often helpful, when solving such puzzles, to transform the puzzle into one about functions from ordered pairs of integers to ordered pairs Intellectual Skill 9 of integers. He knows that in the sense that if you asked him whether it could be useful to consider that transformation of the puzzle, he would immediately say yes, and this answer would come with the phenemenology of recollection, not of new insight. But no one does ask him that question, and the transformation in question simply never occurs to Bob. Since the untransformed puzzle is very hard, while the transformed puzzle is manageable, Bob never solves the problem. It seems to me that what's happened in both cases is that the agent has some knowledge, but is incapable of using it. What they lack is a skill. In particular, they lack what Fridland (2014, 2746) calls 'selective, top-down, automatic attention'. Alice keeps attending to something she should not, even though she knows she should not. Bob fails to attend to something he should, although in some sense he knows that is what he should attend to. Bob's case is one of the reasons I find the picture of skill presented by Stanley and Williamson (forthcoming) unhelpful. They say skill is a disposition to form knowledge. But Bob has the important knowledge. The disposition he lacks is the disposition to activate that knowledge, and let it guide deliberation. That's what constitutes his lack of skill. It's true that knowledge isn't completely passive. If Alice never appealed to the fact that the sunk cost fallacy is a fallacy in her reasoning, we wouldn't say that she knows it. If none of Bob's answers were guided by the existence of natural and useful transformations between rational numbers and ordered pairs of integers, we wouldn't say he knows such transformations are natural and useful. I'm here agreeing with Stanley and Stalnaker that knowledge is itself a kind of disposition. And intellectual skill is a kind of disposition too. But they are very different dispositions. In particular, they have very different triggering conditions. Bob lacks some skill because he does not call to mind this fact about rational numbers right now. He has the salient knowledge about rational numbers because he is disposed to use the facts in question often enough. So intellectual skill and knowledge of relevance have different manifestation conditions, and so they are not identical. But we can say something stronger than that. The cases of Alice and Bob are not in any way unusual. Examples where we forget the salience of some consideration, or can't get an irrelevant point out of our heads, are frequent. In principle, one could respond to the arguments I've made so far by saying that while knowledge of relevance is not identical to skill, nevertheless the two are as closely linked as, say, a material object and the matter that constitutes it. And if I had to resort to bizarre cases of the kind we torture introductory students with to make my point, I'd say that would be the right response. But given how normal Alice and Bob's cases are, this seems like the wrong move. Skill and knowledge don't just come apart in theory, they come apart in practice, frequently. Intellectual Skill 10 3 Four Objections So far I've defended three theses that are in tension with some forms of intellectualism. They are: • Some non-volitional actions are normatively assessable. • Not all intelligent action is preceded by the triggering of representations of relevant knowledge. • Intellectual skill, in particular the intellectual skill associated with starting inquiry in the right place, is not identical to any piece of propositional knowledge. While this doesn't show that, for instance, know how and know that are distinct, and is completely silent on what we should say about know how ascriptions, it does undermine some intellectualist programs. I'll conclude with some objections either to the arguments I've put forward, or to their significance. Objection: Even if all of this is true, there may still be a sense in which intellectualism is true. After all, it could still be that knowledge guides action in a suitable way. (Compare (Stanley, 2011, p. 2).) Reply: This could be true. Whether it is a win for intellectualism depends a bit on the boring question of how we settle the term 'intellectualism', and a bit on more interesting questions about priority. Let's start by distinguishing five theories we might call intellectualist. Identity Intellectualism The possession of an intellectual skill just is the possession of a piece of knowledge. Constitution Intellectualism The possession of an intellectual skill is, always, constituted by a piece of knowledge. Weak Constitution Intellectualism The possession of an intellectual skill is, often, constituted by a piece of knowledge. Causal Intellectualism The possession of an intellectual skill is, always, caused by the possession of a piece of knowledge. Weak Causal Intellectualism The possession of an intellectual skill is, often, caused by the possession of a piece of knowledge. This paper has been arguing against Identity Intellectualism. I think the falsity of this is as much as we could reasonably hope to prove using regress arguments. (I think I'm here agreeing with Wiggins (2009) and Hornsby (2011).) And the considerations behind the regress argument do, I think, show it to be false. If someone wants to insist that by intellectualism, they mean something weaker than this, I'm Intellectual Skill 11 not going to quarrel over terminology. I'll just note that Identity Intellectualism is an interesting, and false, thesis. The arguments here are clearly not arguments against either form of Weak Intellectualism. Indeed, they are naturally understood as the kind of cases that confirm Weak Intellectualism. Mathematics students, like Bob, train by learning a lot of mathematical facts. And it's hard to see how they could develop the relevant skills without knowing some important facts. This is, I suspect, the general case. Skillfully bringing the right considerations to bear on a problem requires, and is probably the causal consequence of, knowing a lot of relevant facts. (Tsai (2014) makes clear how one can simultaneously hold that skills are in part constituted by knowledge of facts without having an intellectualist picture of skill.) But what of the other two intellectualist theories? Do we have reason to think that there are some skills that are not constituted by, or not caused by, the possession of factual knowledge? One way to quickly show that would be to show that there can be skills without the related knowledge. Perhaps that's not just sufficient for rejecting Constitutive/Causal Intellectualism, but necessary. If knowledge without skills is possible, as in Alice and Bob's cases, and skills without knowledge were impossible, that asymmetry would call out for explanation. And something in the vicinity of Constitutive or Causal Intellectualism would be a very good candidate explanation. There are (at least) two promising routes to showing that there can be skills without knowledge. One is due to Imogen Dickie (2012). She argues that since there are so many different routes to skill than there are to knowledge, we should expect that there will be cases of skill that are causally prior to knowledge. Jason Stanley (2012) replies that Dickie's argument assumes an overly narrow conception of propositional knowledge. This is a fascinating debate, but I don't have anything useful to add to it, so I'll just note the existence of this route, and move on. The other route is due to Yuri Cath (2011). He suggests that facts in virtue of which a person might lose propositional knowledge do not always bring about a loss of knowledge that. I'm going to sketch a Cath-style argument that we can have intellectual skills without knowledge. I think the argument has some force, though there are more ways to resist it than there are to resist the argument against Identity Intellectualism. Ross and Rachel are economics students taking an exam. They are given a hard question asking about the likely effects of an exogenous shock, say an earthquake affecting an area the supplies crucial raw materials, on some related markets. The question is hard, with the relevant causal pathways being interconnected and often opposing. The only plausible way forward is to use a model and search for equilibrium points in the model. That's what Ross and Rachel have both been taught to do. Intellectual Skill 12 And in fact both of them quickly select the right kind of model, with just the right amount of complexity in it to answer the question without being overburdened, and set out on the difficult algebra involved in solving the question. So far it looks like both Ross and Rachel have shown intellectual skill. Now it turns out Ross and Rachel have very different views about the role of models in economic thinking. (My own thinking about models has been heavily influenced by (Strevens, 2008, ch. 8) and Davey (2011), and I rely on their insights in what follows.) These models involve, as all models do, some serious idealisation. Most notably, they assume that all the relevant actors are perfectly rational utility maximisers. Rachel hasn't given much thought to this assumption, though she knows it to be literally false. But if pressed, she would say some reasonably sensible things about why she was using the model. For one thing, the familiar failures of human rationality aren't obviously relevant to the puzzle being presented. For another, they've been taught that using these models is a good way to solve problems, and that testimonial evidence carries some weight. And for another, it's an exam, and it is likely that questions have been selected to test how well students can use the models they have been taught. If those are her background, implicit, views, I think it is plausible to say that Rachel knows that the model is relevant to the exam question, even if she couldn't produce a theory of idealisations in economics of the standards of the best philosophers. Ross's views about models are rather different. He thinks the familiar models in economics work, when they do, because the background assumptions are strictly and literally true. He thinks economic agents are utility maximisers, and the apparent evidence to the contrary is due to sloppy experimental design. He thinks markets are always in general equilibrium. And so he thinks that the only sources of error in predictions we can make about markets are from errors about things like the costs of extracting raw materials after the earthquake. This perspective is, of course, grossly mistaken. Moreover, Ross thinks that if the assumptions were not correct, there would be no point in using the models. This too is a mistake, though perhaps not as dramatic as his other mistakes. Now even if Ross and Rachel aren't thinking about these philosophical views about the nature of models, I think they are relevant to whether each of them know that the models are relevant to the puzzle. In particular, I think Rachel does know that the models are relevant, while Ross's belief that they are relevant is more like a lucky guess than a piece of knowledge. Still, I think we should say that Ross showed skill in using this model rather than a more or less complex model, or a different kind of model, or no model at all. So he is a case of intellectual skill without knowledge of relevance. Intellectual Skill 13 I don't think this case is conclusive. I can think of at least four ways someone might reasonably object to the case. 1. It might be argued that despite his false views about why the models are relevant, he really does know that they are relevant. In other words, we would have another counterexample, to be added to those discussed by Warfield (2005) and Luzzi (2010), to the theory that false beliefs cannot generate knowledge. 2. It might be argued that Ross is not really skilled, since it is a matter of luck that the falsity of his beliefs does not lead him to false conclusions here. 3. It might be argued that although Ross doesn't know that this model is relevant, his skill is constituted by, or caused by, some other knowledge he has. 4. It might be argued that the broad picture of the role of idealisations in scientific reasoning that I'm adopting from Strevens and Davey is mistaken, and this fatally undermines my use of the case to argue against intellectualism. I don't think these arguments are going to ultimately work. But it's clear we are a long way from Rylean regress arguments here. And that's where I think the debate about regress arguments should end. We have a good argument against Identity Intellectualism. And we have some suggestive considerations that seem to tell against Constitutive and Causal Intellectualism, but whether these arguments ultimately work will depend on considerations independent of the regress. Objection: Stanley and Williamson (forthcoming) have recently defended the idea that skill is a disposition to form knowledge. And they back this up with empirical analysis of intelligent motor skills, especially drawing on the survey by Yarrow et al. (2009). Is this kind of intellectualism subject to the regress worries? Reply: Once we are taking the dispositions themselves to be the skills, not the underlying knowledge, it feels that we are a long way from traditional intellectualism. But the view is independently interesting, and it is a useful segue to thinking about the relationship between intellectual skills, as conceived of in this paper, and motor skills. I've already mentioned that the Bob example does not seem to fit well with Stanley and Williamson's paradigm. And there is something suspicious about a theory of physical skill that divorces it so strongly from the physical. To be a skilled batsman requires more than dispositions to get knowledge, one might suspect. Stanley and Williamson have a reply to this suspicion. They write, Consider the difference between someone who can bench-press a maximum of 100 pounds and someone who can bench press 150 pounds. We may suppose that both employ the same technique; only brute Intellectual Skill 14 strength makes the difference between them. Both are equally skilled ...Any view of skill must account for such cases. In particular, it must explain why strength, speed, and stamina are not themselves skills.(Stanley and Williamson, forthcoming, 9, page references to preprint) But even if strength is not a skill, it might be a prerequisite for a skill. A batsman whose degenerative back condition means he lacks the flexibility to deploy his trademark pull shot has lost a skill, even if he hasn't lost any dispositions to form knowledge. There is a puzzle as to why qualitative physical differences matter so much to skill attributions why quantitative ones do not. If you can't turn to pull the ball, you've lost a skill, but if a muscle strength decline reduces the power of your pull shot, your skills haven't declined. But that difference doesn't justify making skills entirely cognitive. Still, there is a cognitive angle. One central point of this paper is completely consistent with Stanley and Williamson's picture; motor skills often require forming the right knowledge. The skilled batsman doesn't just pick up many characteristics of the bowler's delivery, they pick up the ones that are most relevant to the trajectory of the ball. As the Bob example shows, they also have to activate that knowledge for it really to be a skill, but that's not a new objection. There is one other cognitive aspect of motor skill that Yarrow et al. (2009) draw attention to, and which fits very nicely with the theme of this paper. It's a specific instance of a much more wide-ranging skill. Sometimes an agent knows that in some time some evidence, drawn from a large space, will come in. She will shortly thereafter have to act in response to the evidence. She has some time to plan now. What should she do? In many such cases, backwards induction is impossible; there are too many possible pieces of evidence that could come in, and planning for each of them is a waste of resources. On the other hand, not planning at all is also a waste of the time she now has, and will lack once the evidence comes in. The solution is to do some planning. And there is a real skill involved in getting the resource allocation right, and neither wasting effort planning for unlikely scenarios, nor wasting the ability to be prepared before one needs to act. Yarrow et al. (2009, 590-1) suggest the same thing happens at a very low level. Highly skilled athletes are making many places in advance of knowing exactly how they will act. Part of the skill involved is allocating the right resources to each of these planning activities. Many of them will ultimately be wasteful, since they are plans for eventualities that do not arise. And one failure condition is that a single plan is not selected, and the agent performs some combination of multiple plans that are worse than either one plan. That failure state is part of the evidence that there is this low-level planning going on before actions. But it is a real skill, and part of the skill is focussing on just the right things. Intellectual Skill 15 So motor skills often have as a constituent part intellectual skills. Some of those skills are closely tied to knowledge; for instance, having priors that track frequencies. Sometimes the skill involved is in focussing on the evidence that the posterior probability is maximally sensitive to, and reacting to that evidence. Sometimes the skill is not attending to evidence that is just going to be unhelpful noise in the activity in question (Yarrow et al., 2009, 589). And sometimes it is in allocating just the right resources to forward planning. All of these seem like intellectual skills, and parts of motor skills. We could try to squeeze all of them into a framework of being dispositions to form knowledge, but it seems more perspicuous to just present the plurality of ways in which the intellect and the body interact, rather than trying to find a single framework. Objection: Appeal to skill does not stop the regress. If we need to posit something, say a skill, that comes between the possession of knowledge and the use of knowledge in reasoning or action, then we also to posit something that comes between the possession of a skill, and the use of that skill in reasoning or action. (Compare (Stanley, 2011, p. 26)). Reply: What I'm going to say here is similar to what Jeremy Fantl (2011) said in a response to an earlier version of Stanley's argument, so I'll be brief. Skills are dispositions. We don't need to posit anything that comes between the disposition and its triggering. If a string is disposed to produce a middle C when struck, and it is struck, we don't need to posit an extra intermediary between the striking and the note. Dispositions stop regresses. But, you might insist, couldn't the same be true of knowledge? After all, on a broadly functionalist construal of the mental, knowledge is a kind of disposition. My reply is in theory knowledge could stop such a regress, but in practice it is unlikely. An agent could be facing a problem where the possible considerations and options can be enumerated without using any particular skill, and the options are few enough that they can be each considered in turn. That is the situation an agent playing a relatively simple game might face. But it isn't the general human condition. In practice, we face problems every moment where it requires skill to bring the right considerations to bear, at least given the processing capacities we have available. Objection: There are semantic arguments that attributions of know how are attributions of propositional knowledge. This shows that Ryle was wrong to draw a broad distinction between know how and know that. Reply: I'm not making any claims about either know how or about 'know how'. I am making some claims about skill, and those imply some claims about 'skill'. But I'm sympathetic to the idea that reports of know how are often reports of some kind Intellectual Skill 16 of practical propositional knowledge. I certainly haven't offered any arguments, nor I think any considerations in the direction of an argument, against this view. Indeed, there are a lot of intellectualst positions that I'm not arguing against here. Anti-intellectualism is often tied up with the view that there is an important distinction between theoretical and practical fields. The arguments I've developed here suggest that if there is such a distinction, then proving mathematical theorems is on the 'practical' side. I think that's a strange enough conclusion that it is time to change our terminology. That's why I've talked about the distinction between intellectual skills and knowledge, not the distinction (if such there is) between know how and know that, or between praxis and theory.

Three slabs of knotty pine stretched across six battered sawhorses to function as work stations, and they held at least a dozen stone sculptures in varying stages of completion. A dented metal cabinet near the garden wall contained the artist's tools: drills, chisels, rifflers, files, gouges, emery, and a collection of sandpaper with differing degrees of abrasion. A colour-splodged painter's dropcloth—smelling strongly of turps—made a dispirited lump underneath a partially broken chaise.\n\nIt was a garden completely without distractions. Walled in against the curiosity of neighbours, it was thus also protected from those insistent and largely mechanical noises of river traffic, of the Great West Road, of Hammersmith Bridge. Indeed, the high walls of the garden were so expertly constructed, the cottage's position on the Lower Mall so well-chosen, that only an occasional waterfowl in flight overhead broke into the superb stillness that the site afforded.\n\nSuch protection was not without one disadvantage. Since cleansing river breezes never found their way through the walls, a patina of stone dust covered everything from the small oblong of dying lawn, to the crimson wallflowers that bordered it, to the square of flagstones that served as a terrace, to the cottage windowsills and the building's pitched roof. Even the artist himself wore fine grey powder like a second skin.\n\nBut this pervasive grime did not bother Kevin Whateley. Over the years, he had become quite used to it. Even if he had not been accustomed to operating perfectly well in a cloud of grit, he would not have noticed it while he laboured in the garden. This was his haven, a place of creative ecstasy in which convenience and cleanliness were not required. Mere discomfort meant nothing to Kevin once he gave himself over to the call of his art.\n\nHe was doing so now, taking his latest piece through the final stage of buffing. He was particularly fond of this current effort, a reclining nude rendered in marble, her head raised on a pillow, her torso twisted so that her right leg was drawn up over her left, her hip and thigh an unbroken crescent that ended with her knee. He ran his hand down her arm, round her buttocks, and along her thigh, testing for rough spots, nodding with satisfaction at the feeling of stone like cold silk beneath his fingers.\n\n\"You do look a bit daft, Kev. Don't believe I ever once saw you smiling like that over me.\"\n\nKevin chuckled, straightened, and looked at his wife who had come to stand in the cottage doorway. She was drying her hands on a faded tea towel, laughter drawing deeply at the wrinkles round her eyes. \"Then come right 'ere and give it a try, girl. You just weren't paying attention last time.\"\n\nPatsy Whateley waved him off with, \"You're crazy, you are, Kev,\" but her husband saw the pleased flush appear on her cheeks.\n\n\"Crazy, am I?\" he asked. \"Not what I recall you saying this morning. That _was_ you, wasn' it, sneaking up on a bloke at six A.M.?\"\n\n\"Kev!\"\n\nShe laughed outright, and Kevin smiled at her, studying her dear, familiar features, admitting the fact that although for some time she had been surreptitiously colouring her hair to preserve a semblance of youth, her face and figure were decidedly middle-aged, the one lined and no longer firm at jaw and chin, the other filled out in places where once he had found the most delicious curves.\n\n\"You're thinking, aren't you, Kev? I can see it on your face. What?\"\n\n\"Dirty thoughts, girl. Enough to make you blush.\"\n\n\"It's these pieces you're working on, i'n it? Looking at naked ladies on a Sunday morning! It's indecent and that's all there is to it.\"\n\n\"What I feel for you's indecent and that's a fact, luv. Step over here. Don't mess me about. I know what you're really like, don't I?\"\n\n\"He's gone mad,\" Patsy declared to the heavens.\n\n\"Mad the way you like.\" He crossed the garden to the cottage door, took his wife into his arms, and kissed her soundly.\n\n\"Lord, Kevin, you taste all of sand!\" Patsy protested when at last he released her. A streak of grey powder tinted the side of her head. Another smeared against her left breast. She brushed at her clothing, muttering with exasperation, but when she looked up and her husband grinned, her face softened and she murmured, \"Half crazy. Always was, you know.\"\n\nHe winked and went back to his work. She continued to watch from the doorway.\n\nFrom the metal cabinet, Kevin brought out the powdered pumice that he used to condition the marble prior to signing his name to a finished piece. Mixing this with water, he smeared it liberally onto his reclining nude and worked it against the stone. He gave his attention to legs and stomach, breasts and feet, taking the greatest care with the delicate work upon the face.\n\nHe heard his wife move restlessly in the doorway. She was, he saw, looking behind her into the kitchen at the red tin clock that hung above the stove.\n\n\"Half-ten,\" she said reflectively.\n\nIt was a statement she intended to sound self-directed, but it didn't deceive Kevin with its pretence of detachment. \"Now, Pats,\" he soothed her, \"you're just making a fuss over nothing. I can see it dead clear. Leave off, can't you? The boy'll ring home as soon as he can.\"\n\n\"Half-ten,\" she repeated, regardless. \"Matt said they'd be back by Eucharist, Kev. Eucharist surely would've ended at ten. It's half-past now. Why's he not rung us?\"\n\n\"He's busy, no doubt. Unpacking. There's schoolwork to be faced. Tales to be told about the weekend's fun. Then lunch with the rest of the boys. So he's forgotten to ring his mum for the moment. But he'll do it by one. Wait and see. Not to worry, luv.\"\n\nKevin knew that telling his wife not to worry about their son was as useful as asking the Thames to stop rising and falling every day with the tide just a few steps away from their own front door. He'd been offering her variations of that admonition for the last twelve and a half years. But it rarely did the slightest bit of good. Patsy _would_ worry herself over every detail of Matthew's life: over whether his clothing was correctly matched; over who was cutting his hair and seeing to his teeth; over the polish on his shoes and the length of his trousers; over his choice of friends and the hobbies he pursued. She studied each one of his letters from school until she had it memorised, and if she didn't hear from him once a week, she worked herself into a state of the jitters that nothing could quell save Matthew himself. He usually did so, which made his failure to telephone after his weekend adventure in the Cotswolds all the harder to understand. This was something that Kevin would not admit to his wife, however.\n\n _Teenagers_ , he thought. _We're in for it now, Pats. The boy's growing up_.\n\nPatsy's response startled her husband, who thought himself not so easily read. \"I know what you're thinking, Kev. He's getting bigger. Won't want his mum fussing over him all the time. There's truth to it. I know.\"\n\n\"So...?\" he encouraged her.\n\n\"So I'll wait a bit before I ring the school.\"\n\nIt was, Kevin knew, the best compromise she would offer. \"That's my girl,\" he replied and went back to his sculpture.\n\nFor the next hour he allowed himself the bliss of complete absorption into the delights of his art, losing track of time entirely. As was usually the case, his surroundings faded into insignificance, and existence was reduced to the immediate sensation of marble coming to life under his hands.\n\nHis wife had to say his name twice to return him from the twilight world he inhabited whenever he was called there by his particular muse. She'd come back to the doorway, but this time he saw that she held a black vinyl handbag in place of the tea towel, and she was wearing her new black shoes and her best navy wool coat. She had inserted a coruscating rhinestone pin haphazardly into the lapel—a sleek lioness with one paw raised and ready to strike. Its eyes were tiny specks of green.\n\n\"He's in the Sanatorium.\" She spoke the last word on a high note of incipient panic.\n\nKevin blinked, eyes drawn to the dance of light diffracting from the lioness rampant. \"Sanatorium?\" he repeated.\n\n\"Our Matt's in the Sanatorium, Kev! He's been there all weekend. I've just rung the school. He didn't ever go to the Morants' at all. He's sick in the San! That Morant boy didn't even know what was wrong. He hadn't seen him since Friday lunch!\"\n\n\"What're you up to, girl?\" Kevin queried shrewdly. He knew full well what the answer would be and sought a moment to ponder how best to stop her.\n\n\"Mattie's ill! Our boy! Lord knows what's wrong. Now, are you coming with me to that school or planning to stand there with your hands on that woman's flipping crotch for the rest of the day?\"\n\nKevin hurriedly removed his hands from the offending part of the sculpture's anatomy. He wiped them down the sides of his work jeans, adding white abrasive cream to the dust and dirt already embedded along the seams.\n\n\"Hang on, Pats,\" he said. \"Think for a minute.\"\n\n\"Think? Mattie's ill! He'll be wanting his mum.\"\n\n\"Will he, luv?\"\n\nPatsy worked on this thought, her lips pressed together as if in the hope of keeping further words at bay. Her spatulate fingers worried the clasp of her handbag, snapping it repeatedly open and shut. From what Kevin could see, the bag was empty. In her rush to be off, Patsy had thought nothing about putting inside a single belonging—a pound coin, a comb, a compact, anything.\n\nHe pulled a piece of old towelling from the pocket of his jeans and rubbed it along his sculpture fondly. \"Think, Pats,\" he gentled her. \"No boy wants Mum flying out to his school if he's got a bit of flu. He's liable to be a bit choked over that, isn't he? Red in the face with Mum hanging about like he needs his nappies changed and she's just the one to do it.\"\n\n\"Are you saying I just let it be?\" Patsy shook her handbag at him to emphasise her words. \"Like I wasn't interested in my own boy's well-being?\"\n\n\"Not let it be.\"\n\n\"Then what?\"\n\nKevin folded his towelling into a small, neat square. \"Let's think this out. What did San Sister tell you's exactly wrong with the boy?\"\n\nPatsy's eyes dropped. Kevin knew what that reaction implied. He laughed at her softly. \"They've a nurse right there on duty at the school and you've not rung her, Pats? Mattie'll have stubbed his toe and his mum'll go running out to West Sussex without a thought given to ringing up to see what's wrong with the boy first! What's to become of the likes of you, girl?\"\n\nHot embarrassment was climbing its way up Patsy's neck and spreading onto her cheeks. \"I'll ring now,\" she managed to say with dignity and went to place the call from the kitchen phone.\n\nKevin heard her dialling. A moment later he heard her voice. A moment after that, he heard her drop the phone. She cried out once, a terrified keening that he recognised as his own name wailed in supplication. He flung his ragged towel to one side and flew into the cottage.\n\nAt first he thought his wife was having an attack of some sort. Her face was grey, and the fist at her lips suggested that a shrieking-out in pain was being withheld by an act of will. When she heard his footsteps and swung to face him, he saw that her eyes were wild.\n\n\"He's not there. Mattie's gone, Kevin. He wasn't in the San. He's not even at the school!\"\n\nKevin struggled to comprehend the horror that those few words implied and found he could only repeat her own statement. \"Mattie? Gone?\"\n\nShe seemed frozen to the spot. \"Since Friday noon.\"\n\nSuddenly that immense stretch of time from Friday to Sunday became a breeding ground for the sort of unspeakable images every parent must confront when first acknowledging a beloved child's disappearance. Kidnapping, molestation, religious cults, white slavery, sadism, murder. Patsy shuddered, gagged. A faint sheen of perspiration appeared on her skin.\n\nSeeing this, fearing she might faint or have a stroke or drop dead on the spot, Kevin grasped her shoulders to offer the only comfort he knew.\n\n\"We'll be off to the school, luv,\" he said urgently. \"We'll see about our boy. I promise you that. We'll go at once.\"\n\n\"Mattie!\" The name rose like a prayer.\n\nKevin told himself that prayers were unnecessary at the moment, that Matthew was only playing the truant, that his absence from the school had a reasonable explanation which they would laugh about together in the time to come. Yet even as he thought this, a vicious tremor shook Patsy's body. She said their son's name beseechingly once again. Against all reason, Kevin found himself hoping that a god somewhere was listening to his wife.\n\nThumbing through her contribution to their report one last time, Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers decided that she was satisfied with the results of her weekend's labour. She clipped the fifteen tedious pages together, shoved her chair back from her desk, and went in search of her immediate superior, Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley.\n\nHe was where she had left him shortly after noon that day, alone in his office, blond head cupped in one hand, his attention directed towards his own section of the report which was spread across the top of his desk. The late Sunday afternoon sun threw long shadows against walls and across the floor, making perusing typescript without artificial light next to impossible. And since Lynley's reading spectacles had slipped disregarded to the end of his nose, Barbara entered the room noiselessly, certain that he was fast asleep.\n\nThat would not have surprised her. For the past two months Lynley had been burning the candle not only at both ends but right through the middle. His presence at the Yard had been so unceasing—generally requiring her own reluctant presence as well—that he'd been jokingly christened Mr. Ubiquitous by the other DI's in his division.\n\n\"Go hame, laddie,\" Inspector MacPherson would roar when he saw him in a corridor, in a meeting, or in the officers' mess. \"Ye're black'ning the rest o' us. Hearkening aifter a super's position? Canna rest on the laurels o' promotion if ye're deid.\"\n\nLynley would laugh in his characteristically affable fashion and sidestep the reason behind this sixty-day stint of unremitting toil. But Barbara knew why he remained on the job long hours into the night, why he volunteered to be on call, why he took other officers' duty at the first request. It was all represented in the single postcard that lay at the moment on the edge of his desk. She picked it up.\n\nIt was five days old, badly creased from a hard journey across Europe from the Ionian Sea. Its subject was a curious procession of incense bearers, sceptre-wielding officials, and gold-gowned, bearded Greek Orthodox priests who carried a bejewelled sedan chair upon their shoulders, its sides made of glass. Resting within the chair, his shrouded head leaning against the glass as if he were asleep and not more than a thousand years dead, were the remains of Saint Spyridon. Barbara turned the card over and unabashedly read its message. She could have guessed before doing so what the tenor of the words would be.\n\nTommy darling, Imagine having your poor remains carried through the streets of Corfu town four times a year! Good Lord, it does give one pause to think about the wisdom of dedicating one's life to sanctity, doesn't it? You'll be pleased to know that I've made my bow to intellectual growth with a pilgrimage to Jupiter's Temple at Kassiope. I dare say you'd approve of such Chaucerian endeavour.\n\nH.\n\nBarbara knew that this card was the tenth such communication from Lady Helen Clyde that Lynley had received in the last two months. Each previous one had been exactly the same, a friendly and amusing commentary upon one aspect of Greek life or another as Lady Helen moved gaily round the country in a seemingly endless journey that had begun in January only days after Lynley had asked her to marry him. Her answer had been a definitive _no_ , and the postcards—all sent to New Scotland Yard and not to Lynley's home in Eaton Terrace—underscored her determination to remain unfettered by the claims of the heart.\n\nThat Lynley thought daily, if not hourly, about Helen Clyde, that he wanted her, that he loved her with a single-minded intensity were the facts which, Barbara knew, comprised the heretofore unspoken rationale behind his infinite capacity for taking on new assignments without protest. Anything to keep the howling hounds of loneliness at bay, she thought. Anything to keep the pain of living without Helen from knotting steadily, like a tumour within him.\n\nBarbara returned the card, retreated a few steps, and expertly sailed her part of their report into his In tray. The subsequent whoosh of air across his desk, the fluttering of his papers to the floor, woke him. He started, grimaced disarmingly at having been caught sleeping, rubbed the back of his neck, and removed his spectacles.\n\nBarbara plopped into the chair next to his desk, sighed, and ruffled her short hair with an unconscious energy that made most of it stand on end like bristles on a brush. She spoke. \"Ah yes, do ye hear those bonny bells of Scotland calling to ye, lad? Tell me ye do.\"\n\nHis reply made its way past a stifled yawn. \"Scotland, Havers? What on earth—\"\n\n\"Aye. Those wee bonny bells. Calling ye home to that land of malt. Those blessit smoky tastes of liquid fire...\"\n\nLynley stretched his lengthy frame and began to gather his papers together. \"Ah. Scotland,\" he replied. \"Do I imagine this sentimental journey into the thistle is an indication that you've not tipped into your weekly allotment of alcohol, Sergeant?\"\n\nShe grinned and sloughed off Robert Burns. \"Let's pop round to the King's Arms, Inspector. You can buy. Two of the MacAllan and we'll both be singing 'Coming Through the Rye.' You don't want to miss that. I've the very devil of a mezzo-soprano sure to bring tears to your lovely brown eyes.\"\n\nLynley polished his spectacles, replaced them on his nose, and began an examination of her work. \"I'm flattered by the invitation. Don't think I'm not. A proffered opportunity to hear you warbling touches me right to the heart, Havers. But surely there's someone else here today into whose wallet you haven't dipped your hand quite so regularly as mine. Where's Constable Nkata? Didn't I see him here this afternoon?\"\n\n\"He's gone out on a call.\"\n\n\"More's the pity. You're out of luck, I'm afraid. I did promise Webberly this report in the morning.\"\n\nBarbara felt a twinge of exasperation. He'd dodged her invitation more adroitly than she'd managed to phrase it. But she had other weapons, so she trotted out the first. \"You've promised it to Webberly in the morning, sir, but you and I know he doesn't need it for another week. Get off it, Inspector. Don't you think it's about time you came back to the land of the living?\"\n\n\"Havers...\" Lynley didn't change his position. He didn't look up from the papers in his hand. His tone alone carried the implicit warning. It was a laying-down of boundaries, a declaration of superiority in the chain of command. Barbara had worked with him long enough to know what it meant when he said her name with such studied neutrality. She was barging into an area off-limits. Her presence was not wanted and would not be admitted without a fight.\n\nWell and good, she thought with resignation. But she could not resist a final sortie into the guarded regions of his private life.\n\nShe jerked her head towards the postcard. \"Our Helen's not giving you much to go on, is she?\"\n\nHis head snapped up. He dropped the report. But the jarring ring of the telephone on his desk precluded reply.\n\nLynley picked up the phone to hear the voice of one of the girls who worked reception in the Yard's unfriendly grey-on-black marble lobby. Visitor below, the adenoidal voice announced without preliminaries. Bloke called John Corntel asking for Inspector Asherton. That's _you_ , I s'pose? Though why some people can't ever keep a body's proper name straight...even when a body takes to stringing names together like some flipping royal _and_ expects reception to know each and every one so's to sort it all out when old schoolmates come calling—\n\nLynley interrupted this verbal tally of woes. \"Corntel? Sergeant Havers will come down to fetch him.\"\n\nHe hung up upon a martyred voice asking him what he thought he'd like to be called _next_ week. Would it be Lynley, Asherton, or some other dusty family title that he thought he'd try out for a month or two? Havers, apparently anticipating his request from what she had heard of the conversation, was already heading out of his office for the lift.\n\nLynley watched her go, her wool trousers flapping round her stubby legs and a scrap of torn paper clinging like a moth to the elbow of her worn Aran sweater. He contemplated this unexpected visit from Corntel, a ghost from the past, to be sure.\n\nThey'd been schoolmates at Eton, Corntel a King's Scholar, one of the elite. In those days, Lynley recalled, Corntel had cut quite a figure among the seniors, a tall and brooding youth, very melancholy, favoured with hair the colour of sepia and a set of aristocratic features reminiscent of those endowed Napoleon on the romantically painted canvases by Antoine-Jean Gros. As if with the intention of holding true to physical type, Corntel had been preparing to take his A-levels in literature, music, and art. What had happened to him after Eton, Lynley could not have said.\n\nWith this image of John Corntel in mind, part of Lynley's own history, it was with some surprise that he rose to greet the man who followed Sergeant Havers into his office less than five minutes later. Only the height remained—two inches over six feet, eye to eye with Lynley. But the frame that had once allowed him to stand so tall and sure of himself, a promising scholar in the privileged world of Eton, was round-shouldered now, as if protecting him from the potential of physical contact. That was not the only difference in the man.\n\nThe curls of youth had given way to hair close cropped to the skull and peppered with premature grey. That miraculous amalgamation of bone, flesh, contour, and colour that had resulted in a face speaking of both sensuality and intelligence now bore a pallor usually associated with sickrooms, and the skin looked stretched across the bones. His dark eyes were bloodshot.\n\nAn explanation had to exist for the change that had come upon Corntel in the seventeen years since Lynley had last seen him. People did not alter so drastically without a central cause. In this case it looked as if a burning or a freezing at the core of the man, having destroyed that interior substance, now pushed forward to decimate the rest.\n\n\"Lynley. Asherton. I wasn't sure which name to use,\" Corntel said diffidently. But the timidity seemed studied, a decision about salutations made well in advance. He offered his hand. It was hot, and felt feverish.\n\n\"I don't use the title much. Just Lynley.\"\n\n\"Useful thing, a title. We called you the Viscount of Vacillation at school, didn't we? But where did that come from? I can't even remember.\"\n\nLynley preferred not to. It stirred up memories. How they assaulted the protected regions of the psyche. \"Viscount Vacennes.\"\n\n\"That was it. The secondary title. One of the joys of being the oldest son of an earl.\"\n\n\"Dubious joys at best.\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\nLynley watched the other man's eyes sweep over the office, taking in the cabinets, the shelves and their books, the general disarray of his desk, the two American Southwest prints. They came to rest on the room's single photograph, and Lynley waited for the other man to comment upon its solitary subject. Corntel and Lynley had both been at Eton with Simon Allcourt-St. James, and since the photograph of him was more than thirteen years old, Corntel would no doubt recognise the jubilant face of that wild-haired young cricket player who was frozen in time, captured in that pure, exhilarating joy of youth with trousers ripped and stained, a sweater pushed above the elbows, and a streak of dirt on his arm. He was leaning against a cricket bat, laughing in sheer delight. Three years before Lynley crippled him.\n\n\"St. James.\" Corntel nodded. \"I've not thought of him in ages. Lord. Time does go, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"It does.\" Lynley continued to study his old schoolmate curiously, noting the manner in which his smile flashed and disappeared, noting how his hands drifted to his jacket pockets and patted them down as if reassuring himself of the presence of some item he intended to produce.\n\nSergeant Havers flipped on the lights to dispel the gloom of the late afternoon. She looked at Lynley. _Stay or go?_ her eyes asked. He nodded her towards one of the office chairs. She sat, reached in her trouser pocket, brought out a packet of cigarettes, and shook out several.\n\n\"Have one?\" she offered Corntel. \"The Inspector here's decided to give up yet another vice—curse him for his sanctimonious desire to stop polluting the air—and I hate to smoke alone.\"\n\nCorntel seemed surprised that Havers was still in the room, but he accepted her offer and produced a lighter.\n\n\"Yes. I will. Thank you.\" His eyes danced to Lynley and then away. His right hand rolled the cigarette against his left palm. His teeth gnawed momentarily at his lower lip. \"I've come for your help,\" he said in a rush. \"I pray you'll do something, Tommy. I'm in serious trouble.\"\n**2**\n\n  \"A boy's gone missing from the school, and as I'm his housemaster, I'm responsible for what's happened to him. God, if something _has..._ \"\n\nCorntel explained himself tersely, smoking between scattered phrases. He was housemaster and head of English at Bredgar Chambers, an independent school tucked into a roll of land between Crawley and Horsham in West Sussex, little more than an hour's drive from London. The boy in question—thirteen years old, a third former, and hence new to the school this year—was a Hammersmith child. The entire situation appeared to be an elaborate ruse orchestrated by the boy to allow him a weekend of perfect freedom. Except that something had gone wrong, somehow, somewhere, and now the boy was missing, had been missing for more than forty-eight hours.\n\n\"I think he may be a runaway.\" Corntel rubbed his eyes. \"Tommy, I should have _seen_ that something was bothering the boy. I should have known. That's part of my job. Obviously, if he was determined to leave the school, if he's been that unhappy all these months and I've failed to see it...God in heaven, the parents arrived at the school in a state of hysteria, one of the board of governors just happened by at the time, and the Headmaster has spent all afternoon trying to keep everything out of the hands of the local police, trying to keep the parents calm, and trying to find out who saw the boy last, and why, most of all _why_ , he ran off without a word. I don't know what to tell anyone, how to excuse...how to make reparation or find some sort of resolution.\" He ran a hand back over his short hair, tried and failed to force a smile. \"I didn't know where to turn at first. Then I thought of you. It seemed an inspired solution. After all, we were mates back at Eton, you and I. And...Christ, I sound like an idiot. I can't even think straight any longer.\"\n\n\"This is a matter for the West Sussex police,\" Lynley replied. \"If indeed it's a police matter at all. Why haven't they been called in, John?\"\n\n\"We've a group on the campus—called the Bredgar Volunteers. Isn't that an absurd name?—and they're out looking for him now, assuming that he's not got that far. Or assuming that something happened to him nearby. It was the Headmaster's decision not to send for the police. He and I spoke. I told him I had a contact here at the Yard.\"\n\nLynley could colour in the details of Corntel's situation well enough. Beyond his legitimate concern for the boy, John Corntel's job—perhaps his entire career—rested upon finding him quickly and finding him well. It was one thing for a child to be homesick, perhaps to make an attempt to go to his parents or his old friends, only to be stopped a short distance—and a short time—away from the school. But this was serious indeed. According to the halting details Corntel had given them, the boy had last been seen on Friday afternoon, with no one giving a thought as to his whereabouts since then. As to the distance he had probably managed to travel since that time...The situation was more than grave for Corntel. It was a prelude to professional disaster. No wonder he was assuring the Headmaster that he could handle it himself, discreetly, quickly, and well.\n\nUnfortunately, there was nothing that Lynley could do. Scotland Yard did not take on cases in this manner, and the force certainly did not step into the jurisdiction of the county police without a formal request from the regional constabulary. So Corntel's trip into London was a waste of time and the sooner he got back to the school and got the case into the hands of the appropriate authorities, the better it would be. Lynley sought to convince him of this, gathering what disjointed facts he could, determined to use them to lead Corntel to the inescapable conclusion that the local police had to be involved.\n\n\"What exactly happened?\" he asked. Sergeant Havers, in rote reaction to her superior's question, reached for a spiral notebook on Lynley's desk and began jotting down questions and responses in her usual competent fashion. She squinted against the smoke from her cigarette, coughed, stubbed it out on the sole of her shoe, and tossed it into the rubbish.\n\n\"The boy—Matthew Whateley—had an exeat this weekend to go to the home of another student, Harry Morant. Morant's family has a country house in Lower Slaughter, and they'd arranged a gathering there for Harry's birthday. Five of the boys were going, six including Harry. They had parents' permission. Everything was in order. Matthew was one of them.\"\n\n\"Who are the Morants?\"\n\n\"Top drawer sort of family,\" Corntel said. \"Three older sons have gone through Bredgar Chambers. A sister's in the lower sixth there now. We take girls in their last two years,\" he added uselessly. \"Lower and upper sixth girls. I think what happened is that Matthew got cold feet about the business because of that. I mean, because of the family—the Morants—not because we take girls at the school.\"\n\n\"I don't see why. What's the family got to do with it?\"\n\nCorntel shifted in his seat with a look at Sergeant Havers. Lynley saw in that nervous sweep of the eyes what would be said next. Corntel had heard Havers' distinct working class accent. If the Morants were being brought forward as the source of the problem—and were, as Corntel said, a top drawer family—then Matthew was no doubt, like Havers, from a distinctly different part of the chest.\n\n\"I think Matthew got cold feet,\" Corntel explained. \"He's a city boy, this is his first year in an independent school. He's always been in the state schools before. He's always lived at home. Now that he's mixing with a different sort of people...it takes time. It's difficult to adjust.\" His hand moved out, open-palmed, in an appeal for mutual understanding. \"You know what I mean.\"\n\nLynley saw Havers' head come up, saw her eyes narrow at the implication behind Corntel's words. She had, he well knew, always worn her working-class background like a suit of armour. \"And when Matthew failed to show up for the journey on Friday? There must have been some meeting place where the boys gathered before they set off for their weekend together. Didn't they wonder where he was? Didn't they report to you when he didn't show up?\"\n\n\"They thought they knew where he was. We had games Friday afternoon, and the trip to Lower Slaughter was scheduled afterwards. The boys are all on the same hockey team. Matthew didn't show up for the game, but everyone thought it was in perfect order because the third form hockey master—Cowfrey Pitt, one of our teachers—had received a note from the Sanatorium, saying that Matthew had become ill and wouldn't be there for the game. When they heard this, the boys assumed that he wouldn't be going on the weekend either. It seemed logical enough at the time.\"\n\n\"What sort of note was it?\"\n\n\"An off-games chit. Just a standard form from the Sanatorium with Matthew's name on it. Frankly, it looks to me as if Matthew set the entire situation up in advance. He would get permission from home to leave campus and arrange it to look as if he were going to the Morants'. At the same time, he would have in his possession an off-games chit indicating that he was ill in the Sanatorium. But because the chit wasn't legitimate, I would get no copy of it from the San. So I would think Matthew left with the Morants. The Morants, in the meantime, would think he was still at the school. Then the weekend would be his own to do as he liked. Which is exactly what he did, the little beggar!\"\n\n\"You didn't check up on his whereabouts?\"\n\nCorntel leaned forward and crushed out his cigarette. The movement was unsteady. Ashes spilled onto Lynley's desk. \"I thought I _knew_ his whereabouts. I thought he was with the Morants.\"\n\n\"And the hockey master—was it Cowfrey Pitt?—didn't inform you that he'd gone to the Sanatorium?\"\n\n\"Cowfrey assumed the San would let me know. That's how it's usually done. And if I'd been told Matthew was ill, I _would_ have gone to the San to see him. Of course I would have.\" The strength of Corntel's protestations was curious. With each of them, the man spoke more intently.\n\n\"You've a head of house as well, don't you? What was he doing all this time? Was he in school this weekend?\"\n\n\"Brian Byrne. Yes. A senior boy. A prefect. Most of the seniors were off on exeats—at least those who hadn't gone to a hockey tournament in the North—but he was there. Right in the house. As far as he knew, Matthew was with the Morants. He didn't check into that any more than I did. Why should he have done so? If any checking was to be done, it was my responsibility, not Brian's. I'll not foist it off onto my prefect. I won't.\"\n\nLike the earlier protestations, there was peculiar force behind Corntel's declaration, child of a need to take all blame upon himself. Lynley knew that there was usually only one reason for the existence of such a need. If Corntel wanted the blame, no doubt he deserved it.\n\n\"He must have known that he'd be out of his depth with the Morants. He must have felt it,\" Corntel said.\n\n\"You seem certain of that.\"\n\n\"He was a scholarship student.\" Corntel seemed to feel that statement explained everything. Nonetheless, he went on to say, \"Good boy. Hard worker.\"\n\n\"Liked by the other students?\" When Corntel hesitated, Lynley said, \"After all, if he'd been invited for a weekend at one of their homes, it seems reasonable to conclude he was liked.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. He must have been. It's just that...Do you see how I've failed the boy? I don't _know_. He was so quiet. All he ever seemed to do was his schoolwork. He never had a problem. He never even spoke of one. And his parents were so keen to have him go on this weekend. His father said as much to me when he wrote his permission. Something like 'Nice to have Mattie move into the world a bit.' Mattie. That's what they called him.\"\n\n\"Where are the parents now?\"\n\nCorntel's face pinched with misery. \"I don't know. At the school perhaps. Or at home waiting for word. If the Headmaster hasn't managed to stop them, they may have gone directly to the police themselves.\"\n\n\"Has Bredgar Chambers access to a local police force?\"\n\n\"There's a constable in Cissbury—that's the nearest village. Otherwise, we're under the jurisdiction of the Horsham force.\" He smiled grimly. \"Part of their patch, you'd call it, wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"Yes. And I'm afraid it's not part of mine.\"\n\nCorntel's shoulders caved in further at this admission. \"Surely you can do something, Tommy. Put some sort of wheels in motion.\"\n\n\"Discreet wheels?\"\n\n\"Yes. All right. Whatever you want to call them. It's a personal favour, I know. I've no rights here. But for God's sake, we have Eton.\"\n\nIt was a draw upon loyalties. The old school tie. That assumption of devotion to the calls of the past. Lynley wanted to cut beyond it as ruthlessly as he could. The policeman in him insisted that he do so. But the boy who had once shared school days with Corntel was not quite as dead as Lynley wanted him to be. So he asked:\n\n\"If he had run off, perhaps with the intention of coming up to London, he'd need transportation, wouldn't he? How close are you to the trains? To the motorway? To one of the larger roads?\"\n\nCorntel seemed to take this as the extending hand of help he wanted. He answered definitively, eager to be of assistance.\n\n\"We're not very near anything useful, Tommy, which is why parents feel secure in sending their children to the school. It's isolated. There's no trouble to get into. There's nothing around to distract. Matthew would have had quite a hike to get safely away. He couldn't afford to hitch a ride too near the school because if he did, the chance would have been very good that someone from the school—one of the instructors, perhaps, or a workman or the porter—might have gone driving by, seen him, and packed him right back where he belongs.\"\n\n\"So he probably wouldn't have kept to the road at all.\"\n\n\"I don't think he would. I think he'd have had to go through the fields, through St. Leonard's Forest, up to Crawley and the M23. He'd have been safe at that point. He would have been seen as just any child. No one would suspect that he was from Bredgar Chambers.\"\n\n\"St. Leonard's Forest,\" Lynley said reflectively. \"The likeliest possibility is that he's still there, isn't it? Lost perhaps. Hungry.\"\n\n\"And two nights without shelter in March. Exposure. Hypothermia. Starvation. A broken leg. A bad fall. A broken neck.\" Corntel compiled the list bitterly.\n\n\"Starvation's unlikely after only three days,\" Lynley responded. He did not add the more damning remark that any of the others were distinctly possible. \"Is he a big child? Hefty?\"\n\nCorntel shook his head. \"Not at all. He's very small for his age. Delicate bones. Extremely fragile. Good structure in the face.\" He paused, his eyes focusing on an image the others could not see. \"Dark hair. Dark eyes. Long-fingered hands. Perfect skin. Lovely skin.\"\n\nHavers tapped a pencil against her notebook. She looked at Lynley. Seeing her do so, Corntel stopped speaking. Colour dashed across his face in great bruising patches.\n\nLynley pushed his chair away from his desk and let his eyes rest on one of the two prints on his wall in which an Indian woman dumped a basket of peppers onto a blanket. It was a compilation of vibrant colours. Her veil of black hair, the living red of the vegetables, the tawny velvet of her skin, her purple gown, the blend of rose and blue background that called the time of day _sunset_. Beauty, he knew, always offered its own form of seduction.\n\n\"Have you brought a picture of the boy?\" Lynley asked. \"Can you write out an accurate description of him?\" The last question, he thought, would probably be unnecessary.\n\n\"Yes. Of course. Both.\" Never before had Lynley heard such relief.\n\n\"Then if you'll leave them with the sergeant, we'll see if there's anything we can do from this end. Perhaps he's already been picked up in Crawley and is too afraid to give his name. Or even closer to London. One can never tell.\"\n\n\"I thought...I _hoped_ you'd help. I've already...\" Corntel reached into the breast pocket of his coat, bringing out a photograph and a folded page of typescript. He had the grace to look faintly abashed by the assumption of Lynley's cooperation that was implied by his possession of both.\n\nLynley took them wearily. Corntel had been confident of his man indeed. The old Viscount of Vacillation would hardly desert one of his former schoolmates now.\n\nBarbara Havers read the description that Corntel had left with them. She studied the photograph of the boy as Lynley dumped out the ashtray that she and Corntel had managed to fill during the interview. He wiped it carefully with a tissue.\n\n\"God, you're getting to be an unbearable prig over this smoking business, Inspector,\" Barbara complained. \"Should I start wearing a scarlet S on my chest?\"\n\n\"Not at all. But either I clean the ashtray or find myself licking it in desperation. Somehow, cleaning seems closer to a behaviour I can live with. But only just, I'm afraid.\" He looked up, smiled.\n\nShe laughed even through her exasperation. \"Why did you give up smoking? Why not march right into an early grave with the rest of us? The more the merrier. You know the sort of thing.\"\n\nHe didn't answer. Instead, his eyes went to the postcard propped up against a coffee cup on his desk. So Barbara knew. Lady Helen Clyde did not smoke. Perhaps she would find more acceptable upon her return a man who had given up smoking as well.\n\n\"Do you really think that's going to make a difference, Inspector?\"\n\nHis reply was as good as ignoring her altogether. \"If the boy's run away, I shouldn't be surprised if he turns up in a few days. Perhaps in Crawley. Perhaps in the city. But if he doesn't turn up, as callous as it sounds, his body may. Are they prepared for that, I wonder.\"\n\nBarbara skilfully turned the statement to her own use. \"Is anyone ever really prepared for the worst, Inspector?\"\n\n_Send my roots rain. Send my roots rain_.\n\nWith those four words pressing into her brain like a persistent melody, Deborah St. James sat in her Austin, eyes fixed on the lych gate of St. Giles' Church outside the town of Stoke Poges. She scrutinised nothing in particular. Instead, she tried to count how many times over the last month she had recited not just those final words but Hopkins' entire sonnet. She had started every day with it, had made it the force that propelled her from beds and hotel rooms, into her car, and through site after site where she took photographs like an automaton. But beyond every morning's determined recitation of those fourteen lines of supplication, she could not have said how many times during each day she had returned to it, when some unexpected sight or sound she was unprepared for broke through her defences and attacked her calm.\n\nShe understood why the lines came to her now. St. Giles' Church was the last stop in her four-week photographic odyssey. At the end of this afternoon she would return to London, avoiding the M4, which would take her there quickly, and choosing instead the A4 with its traffic signals, its congestion round Heathrow, its infinite stream of suburbs grimy with soot and the grey end of winter. And its additional blessing of extending the journey. That was the crucial part. She didn't yet see how she could face the end of it. She didn't yet see how she could face Simon.\n\nAges ago when she had accepted this assignment to photograph a selection of the literary landmarks of the country, she had planned it so that Stoke Poges, where Thomas Gray composed \"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,\" would fall directly after Tintagel and Glastonbury, and thus bring her month of work to a conclusion only a few miles from her doorstep. But Tintagel and Glastonbury, rich with ineluctable reminders of King Arthur and Guinevere, of their ill-fated and ultimately barren love, had only given teeth to the despondency with which she had begun the trip. Those teeth bit; today on this final afternoon, they tore, working upon her heart, laying bare its worst wound....\n\nShe _wouldn't_ think of it. She opened the car door, took up her camera case and tripod, and walked across the car park to the lych gate. Beyond it she could see that the graveyard was divided into two sections and that midway down a curved concrete path, a second lych gate and second graveyard stood.\n\nThe air was cold for late March, as if deliberately withholding the promise of spring. Birds tittered sporadically in the trees, but other than the occasional muffled roar of a jet from Heathrow, the graveyard itself was quiet. It seemed a suitable spot for Thomas Gray to have created his poem, to have chosen as his own resting place.\n\nClosing the first lych gate behind her, Deborah walked along the path between two lines of tree roses. New growth sprouted from them—tight buds, slim branches, tender young leaves—but this springtime regeneration contrasted sharply with the area in which the trees themselves grew. This outer graveyard was not maintained. The grass was uncut, the stones left to lurch at odd angles with haphazard disregard.\n\nDeborah went under the second lych gate. It was more ornate than the first and, perhaps in the hope of keeping vandals away from the delicate oak fretwork along the line of its roof—or perhaps from the graveyard and the church itself—a floodlight was secured to a beam. But this was a useless safeguard, for the light was shattered and shards of glass lay here and there on the ground.\n\nOnce inside the interior churchyard, Deborah looked for Thomas Gray's tomb, her final photographic responsibility. Almost immediately, however, as she made a fleeting survey of the monuments and markers, she saw instead a trail of feathers.\n\nThey lay like the result of an augur's handiwork, a rebarbative collection of ash-coloured down. Against the manicured lawn, they looked like small puffs of smoke that had taken on substance rather than drifting off to be absorbed into the sky. But the number of feathers and the unmistakably violent way in which they were strewn about suggested a vicious battle for life, and Deborah followed them the short distance to where the defeated party lay.\n\nThe bird's body was about two feet from the yew hedge that separated inner and outer graveyards. Deborah stiffened at the sight of it. Even though she had known what she would find, the brutality of the poor creature's death evoked in her an answering rush of pity so intense—so utterly absurd, she told herself—that she found her vision momentarily obscured by tears. All that remained of the bird was a frail blood-imbued rib cage covered by an insubstantial and inadequate cuirass of stained down. There was no head. Frail legs and claws had been torn off. The creature could have once been a pigeon or a dove, but now it was a shell in which life had once existed, all too briefly.\n\nHow fleeting it was. How quickly it could be extinguished.\n\n\"No!\" Deborah felt the anguish well within her and knew she lacked the will to defeat it. She forced herself to think of something else—of burying the bird, of brushing the scurrying ants from the serrated ridge of one cracked rib—but the effort was useless. Hopkins' sonnet, whispered in a rush against a rising onslaught of sorrow, was insufficient armour. So she wept, watching the dead bird's image blur, praying that a time would soon come when she could put an end to grief.\n\nFor the last four weeks, work had been an anodyne. She turned to it now, backing away from the bird, clutching her equipment in hands that were cold.\n\nThe job called for a set of photographs which reflected the piece of literature that had inspired them. Since late February, Deborah had explored the Brontës' Yorkshire and given herself over to Ponden Hall and High Withens; she had set up camera and tripod for a moonlit examination of Tintern Abbey; she had photographed the Cobb and most particularly Granny's Teeth from which Louisa Musgrove took her fatal fall; she had wandered the tournament field in Ashby de la Zouch, sat on the sidelines and watched the comings and goings in the pump room in Bath, walked the streets of Dorchester looking for the slow hand of dest\n", "final_result_str": "repair", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "c8a2c8d9-5eb5-4b4a-96b9-87dc5d8cfd31", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "正常小说"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "bbe65e2f-55fb-4d72-aed2-34c2c705ce4b", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "need_repair", "evidence": "前置目录的书籍内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "a8b6f1d8-1b7d-422f-808f-beb3e9bd11da", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "逻辑：文学作品，逻辑较为一般"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "6a17ec09-e9f5-4dae-b437-973989aa4e4c", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "书"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

THE CAR THAT WOULDN’T BEHAVE.\n\n\n“Sufferin’ whirligigs, Pard Matt! Look at that bubble wagon! Is it\ntrying to turn a handspring, or ‘skin the cat,’ or climb that telephone\npole? I reckon the longhorn up front don’t know how to run the thing.\nEither that, or else he’s ‘bug’ with a big ‘B.’”\n\n“I should say it’s the car that’s ‘bug,’ Joe. The driver seems to be\ntrying to control the machine in the proper manner, but it won’t be\ncontrolled. What’s your notion of it, Billy?”\n\n“Hoodoo car, Matt. Look at the number of her--thirteen thirteen. Double\nhoodoo. You couldn’t expect no chug wagon with such a tag to behave\nanything else than disgraceful. Lo and behold you, if she don’t turn\nturtle in the ditch before she goes many more miles then my name’s\nnot Billy Wells. Watch ’er; keep your eye on ’er an’ I’ll bet you see\nsomething.”\n\nThe three boys were driving along the Jericho Pike well toward Krug’s\nCorner--Matt King, Joe McGlory, and Billy Wells. Billy belonged with a\nNew York garage from which the boys had secured the touring car they\nwere using that morning. He was a living road map, this Billy, and\ncould go anywhere up-state, or over Long Island, or in Jersey on the\ndarkest night that ever fell, and he knew every minute just where he\nwas.\n\nMatt was doing the driving, and Billy sat beside him as guide,\ncounselor, and friend. In the back of the machine was McGlory.\n\nThat was Thursday. Matt and his chum were heeding a summons that\ncarried them toward the Malvern Country Club, near Hempstead. After\ntransacting their business at the Country Club--they did not know what\nit was, but believed it would not take them long--they were planning to\nreturn to Krug’s Corner for their noon meal, and then back to Manhattan\nby Jackson Avenue and the Williamsburg Bridge. But plans are easily\nmade, sometimes, and not so easily carried out.\n\nThe day was bright, the roads were good, and the motor boys were\nenjoying themselves. Well along the Jericho Pike they had come up with\na white runabout, two seats in front and a deck behind, and the actions\nof this car aroused their curiosity to such an extent that Matt slowed\ndown the big machine in order that he and those with him could follow\nand watch the performance.\n\nThere was only one passenger in the white car, and he was having his\nhands full.\n\nThe runabout would angle from one side of the road to the other, in\napparent defiance of the way the steering wheel was held, and sometimes\nit would go its eccentric course slowly and sometimes with a rush--so\nfar as those in the other car could see--without any change in the\nspeed gear.\n\nThe driver of the runabout worked frantically to keep the machine where\nit ought to be, but the task was too much for him.\n\nOnce a telephone pole gave him a close shave, and once his\nunmanageable car gave a sidewise lurch that almost hurled it into a\nmachine going the other way.\n\n“What’s the matter?” Matt hailed.\n\nThe man in the runabout looked around with a facial expression that was\nfar from angelic.\n\n“If I knew what was the matter with this confounded car,” he cried in\nexasperation, “do you think I’d be side-stepping all over the road the\nway I am?” Then, muttering to himself, he humped over the steering\nwheel again.\n\n“He’s happy--I don’t think,” chuckled McGlory. “The car’s getting on\nhis nerves.”\n\n“A car like that would get on anybody’s nerves,” commented Billy. “The\nnumber’s enough to set mine on edge. Thirteen’s unlucky, no matter\nwhere you find it. That’s right. And when you get two thirteens bunched\ntogether, you’ve sure got a combination that points a car for the scrap\nheap. I wouldn’t hold down the cushions in that roadster for all the\nmoney in New York. No, sir, that I wouldn’t,” and Billy shook his head\nforebodingly.\n\n“Oh, splash!” scoffed Matt. “When a car fools around like that, Billy,\nthere’s something wrong with its internal apparatus.”\n\n“Matt,” went on Billy solemnly, “I’ve seen cars that hadn’t a thing\nwrong with ’em, but they was just naturally crazy and never’d run\nright. Steer ’em straight, an’ they’d go crooked; point ’em crooked,\nan’ they’d go straight; throw on the reverse, an’ they’d go for’ard;\ngive ’em the third speed an’ they’d crawl; give ’em the first an’\nthey’d tear away like lightnin’--and all the while, mind you, the\nengine was running as sweet as any engine you ever see. The Old Boy\nhimself takes charge of some cars the moment they’re sold and in a\ncustomer’s hands. I’ve worked in a garage for five years, and I know.”\n\nMatt laughed. McGlory laughed, too, but not so mirthfully. The cowboy\nhad a little superstition in his make-up and Billy’s remarks had left a\nfleeting impression.\n\n“Gammon, Billy, gammon,” said Matt. “If a car is built right, and works\nright, it is going to run right. That stands to reason.”\n\n“A lot of things happen,” insisted Billy, “that don’t stand to reason.\nNow, take that runabout. The engine’s working fine--from the sound of\nit. Eh?”\n\nMatt admitted that, so far as the hum of the motor was concerned, the\nmachinery seemed to be doing its part.\n\n“Well, then,” cried the triumphant Billy, “why don’t the blooming car\nrun like it ought to?”\n\n“It’s the steering gear that’s wrong,” Matt answered, “not the engine,\nor----”\n\nBang!\n\nJust then the runabout blew up a forward tire. The machine tried to\nturn a somersault, and its passenger went over on the hood and tried\nto knock off one of the gas lamps with his head. When Matt brought the\ntouring car to the side of the runabout, and halted, the man was on his\nfeet, shaking his fist at the silent white tormentor.\n\n“If I had a stick of dynamite,” he declared wrathfully, “I’d blow\nthis infernal machine to kingdom come! I’ve been fiddling around the\nJericho Road for two mortal hours, and I could have made better time if\nI’d left the car and gone on afoot. But I’ll hang to it, and make it\ntake me where I’m going. By George, I’ll not be beaten by a senseless\ncontraption of tires, mud guards, and machinery.”\n\nMatt had jumped out of the touring car and was sniffing at the damaged\ntire.\n\n“What makes that smell of gasoline?” he asked.\n\n“I put in a tube this morning, and washed out the chalk with gasoline,”\nsaid the man.\n\n“Never use gasoline for cleaning the tubes,” counseled Matt. “Get all\nthe chalk you can from the outer tube, and then soak it in wood naphtha\nor ordinary alcohol. No wonder your tire blew up. You left gasoline in\nthe shoe, and when it got hot, it mixed with a little air in the tube\nand something had to happen. Have you got another shoe?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And a jack?”\n\n“Of course. When a man goes out with a car like this he ought to carry\na small garage around with him.”\n\n“Well, we’ll help you get on the shoe.”\n\nMatt and Billy worked. McGlory stood near, watching and talking with\nthe owner of the car.\n\nAfter the tire had been repaired, Matt looked over the runabout\ncritically. Much to his amazement, he could find nothing wrong.\n\n“It’s the double hoodoo,” whispered Billy; “that’s all that’s the\ntrouble.”\n\n“Much obliged to you,” said the man, cranking up. “Now we’ll see how\nshe acts.”\n\nHe got in, went through the operations for a fresh start, but the\nrunabout began backing. While the man shouted, and said things, the\nrunabout backed in a circle around the big touring car, then dropped\nrearward down a shallow embankment at the roadside--and its passenger\nhad another spill, out over the rear deck this time. For a second, he\nstood on his head and shoulders, then turned clear over and made a\nquick move sideways in getting to his feet. He was afraid, evidently,\nthat the runabout was coming on top of him. But the car, almost in\ndefiance of the laws of gravitation, hung to the side of the steep\nbank, its position nearly perpendicular.\n\n“Speak to me about that!” gasped McGlory.\n\nMatt was scared. From the top of the bank he stood staring while the\nman got out of the way.\n\n“Are you all right?” Matt asked.\n\n“No thanks to that fiendish machine if I am,” sputtered the man,\nlaboring frantically up the <DW72>. “It has tried to kill me in a dozen\ndifferent ways since I left home with it. I’m done. Life’s too short to\nbother with such an infernal car as that.”\n\nFairly boiling with rage, he started along the road on foot.\n\n“Wait a minute!” shouted Matt. “Where you going?”\n\nThe man turned.\n\n“Krug’s,” he answered. “I’ll get a decent, respectable car there to\ntake me on.”\n\n“You can telephone to a garage from Krug’s,” suggested Billy, “and they\ncan send some one to get the runabout home.”\n\n“I’m done with the runabout, I tell you. It can stay where it is until\nthe tires rot, for all of me.”\n\n“I’ll agree to get it back to the city for you,” said Matt. “My name’s\nKing, Matt King, and I’m staying at----”\n\nThe man’s rage subsided a little.\n\n“You’re Matt King?” he inquired.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I understand, now, how you happen to know so much about tubes. They\nsay you’re pretty well up in motors, too. Well, here’s where I give you\nthe job of your life. Matt King, I make you a present of that runabout.\nTake it--but Heaven help you if you try to run it.”\n\nThereupon the man whirled around and strode off.\n\n“Oh, I say,” yelled Matt, “you don’t mean it. Wait, and I’ll----”\n\nBut the man swung onward, paying no heed to what Matt was calling after\nhim.\n\nMatt King turned and peered in amazement at his cowboy chum.\n\n“Sufferin’ tenterhooks!” exclaimed McGlory. “You’re loaded up with a\nbunch of trouble now, pard.”\n\n“Come on,” urged Billy, moving toward the touring car with considerable\nhaste. “Don’t lay a finger on that runabout--don’t have a thing to do\nwith it.”\n\nBut Matt was face to face with a proposition that caught his fancy. A\nrefractory automobile! Never yet had he encountered a machine that had\ngot the best of him. And this runabout couldn’t do it--he was positive\nof that.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. MATT KING’S RESOLVE.\n\n\n“That man was so mad he was locoed,” observed the cowboy.\n\n“Certainly he was, Joe,” agreed Matt. “If he hadn’t been, he’d never\nhave given away that machine. It’s a powerful car and worth twenty-five\nhundred of any man’s money.”\n\n“Don’t tamper with it, Matt,” implored Billy. “When that fellow gets\nover his mad spell he’ll want the runabout back. Let him have it--and\nlet him find it right where he left it.”\n\n“If he hadn’t been worked up like he was,” said Matt, “he wouldn’t have\ngiven the car to me. I won’t take it, of course, but Joe and I will use\nit to take us to the Malvern Country Club, and then back to Manhattan.\nBy to-morrow that fellow will be looking for me and wanting his car\nback.”\n\n“You wouldn’t think of such a thing as wanting to bother with that\nrunabout!” gasped Billy, from his seat in the touring car.\n\n“Yes, I would,” answered Matt. “Why not?”\n\n“The number--thirteen thirteen!”\n\n“Bosh!”\n\n“It’s a hoodoo car.”\n\n“Never mind about that, Billy. You go on to Krug’s Corner and get a\nstout rope. If you overtake the owner of the runabout you can give him\na lift. See him, anyhow, and tell him we’ll take the runabout to New\nYork and that he can have it whenever he wants it.”\n\n“Don’t do it!” begged Billy. “I’ve seen enough of these hoodoo cars to\nknow they’ll prove the death of somebody. Don’t let that runabout prove\nthe death of you!”\n\n“Go get the rope, Billy,” said Matt sharply, “and hustle back with it.”\n\nThere was that in the voice of Matt King which proved that he had made\nup his mind, and that there was no shaking his determination. With an\nominous movement of the head, Billy started for Krug’s Corner.\n\n“Pard,” remarked McGlory earnestly, “I reckon the runabout is heap bad\nmedicine. Do you think you ought to mix up with it?”\n\n“Are you going back on me, Joe?” asked Matt.\n\n“Not so you can notice. I’d get on a streak of greased lightning with\nyou, if you said the word, and help you ride it to the end of the\nOne-way Trail, but I think this is too big an order for us. Sufferin’\nthunderbolts! Why, pard, that car won’t mind the helm or do the thing\nit ought to do even when you pull the right thing. When it began to\ncrawfish around the road, the reverse wasn’t on.”\n\n“I don’t know about that. It’s on now,” and he looked down at\nthe runabout. “I guess the man must have thrown on the reverse\ninstinctively when the tire blew up. Think of rinsing the chalk from\nthe outer tube with gasoline!” Matt laughed. “There was good cause for\nthe tire going wrong, and there may be other good and sufficient causes\nfor the machine’s sizzling around like it did. Anyhow, we’ll try it,\nand see how it will behave for us.”\n\n“But how can we lay a course for the Malvern Country Club? Billy will\nhave to show us.”\n\n“Billy can tell us how to go, and we’ll get to the Country Club all\nright. Hello! What’s this?”\n\nMatt began slipping and sliding down the <DW72> at the side of the\nrunabout. Just at the point where the driver of the car had taken his\nheader, the young motorist picked up a long manila envelope, unsealed.\n\n“I reckon that dropped out of the man’s clothes while he was upside\ndown,” ventured McGlory.\n\n“That’s a cinch,” said Matt. “There’s no address on the envelope, and\nno printed card in the corner, but it may be we can find the man’s name\nand address on the papers inside. If he won’t come for his car, we’ll\ntake it to him.”\n\n“I’m a Piute,” mumbled McGlory, “if I feel right about this runabout\nbusiness.”\n\n“Billy’s talk about hoodoo cars has got you on the run,” grinned Matt.\n“You’ll feel different when we’re slamming along the pike with the\nrunabout under perfect control. It’s my opinion that man doesn’t know a\nwhole lot about running a car.”\n\nWhile Matt was moving here and there about the steep bank, making a few\ninvestigations of the “hoodoo” machine, Billy came racing back.\n\n“There’s your rope, Matt,” said he, tossing a coiled cable into the\nroad.\n\nMatt crept warily up the bank to the front of the runabout.\n\n“Did you see the man, Billy?” he asked.\n\n“Sure I did. Let him ride with me for half a mile.”\n\n“You told him what we were going to do?”\n\n“I did. He says that if you get that car back to the city, and try to\nturn it over to him, he’ll have you arrested for assault with intent\nto do great bodily damage. He says the runabout is a powder mine, and\nliable to blow up at any minute. ‘Tell Matt King to keep it,’ he said,\n‘providing he’s got the nerve.’ That’s the way he handed it to me. Take\nmy advice,” Billy clamored desperately, “and leave it alone!”\n\n“Joe and I are going to use it,” answered Matt. “Hand me an end of\nthat rope, pard,” he added to the cowboy.\n\nMcGlory passed him the rope, and Matt made it secure to the front of\nthe runabout.\n\n“Back up, Billy,” called Matt, “and tie the other end of the rope to\nthe touring car. You’ve got to give us a lift into the road.”\n\n“What if something should happen?” demurred Billy.\n\n“Nonsense!” said Matt impatiently.\n\n“You can’t give the car back to that fellow if he won’t take it.”\n\n“We’ll make him take it. He’s a very foolish man, and he’s going to\nfeel differently when his temper cools.”\n\nBilly, not in a very comfortable frame of mind, backed the touring car\nclose to the edge of the bank. The rope was made fast, and Matt and\nMcGlory went to the foot of the bank to push while the big machine\npulled.\n\nThe attempt was successful. The runabout sputtered--perhaps\ndefiantly--as it yielded to the tugging and rolled up the <DW72>. Matt\nlooked the machine over and could not find that it had suffered any by\nthe slide down the <DW72>.\n\n“It’ll hang together till it gets you, Motor Matt,” observed Billy\ngrewsomely. “That’s the way with these hoodoo cars. They never go to\npieces till they kill somebody.”\n\n“You’re too good a driver, Billy, to talk such foolishness,” returned\nMatt. “Now, tell us how to get to the Malvern Country Club.”\n\n“Ain’t I going with you?”\n\n“Three of us couldn’t ride very comfortably in the runabout.”\n\n“But hadn’t I better go along in the touring car so as to be handy in\ncase of accidents?”\n\n“Oh, Joe and I will get along. We’re not going to have any accidents if\nwe can help it--and I feel pretty sure we can.”\n\nBilly laid out the course the boys were to take with considerable\ndetail. When he was through, Matt felt that he had the route clearly\nfixed in his mind.\n\n“If the runabout’s too much for you,” Billy finished, “all you’ve got\nto do is to phone the garage, and I’ll come a-runnin’.”\n\n“Where did you get the rope?” asked Matt.\n\nBilly told him he had borrowed it at Krug’s.\n\n“We’ll leave it there,” said Matt, “on our way past the Corner.”\n\n“You may never get to Krug’s,” answered Billy, in extreme dejection.\n\n“Pile in, Joe,” said Matt, “and we’ll throw in the clutch and scoot.”\n\nMcGlory, it must be admitted, climbed into the runabout in a way that\nproved his lack of confidence. Matt cranked up, listening with deep\nsatisfaction to the smooth singing of the engine, and then got into the\ndriver’s seat.\n\nBilly, in the touring car, watched tremulously and waited. From his\nappearance, he was plainly expecting that the white car would turn a\nfew cartwheels and perhaps land upside down in the middle of the road\nwith Matt and McGlory underneath.\n\nBut nothing of the sort happened. Car No. 1313 moved off in the\ndirection of Krug’s as nice as you please--moved on a hair line, with\nnone of the distressing wabbling which characterized its previous\nperformance with its owner at the wheel.\n\nThe cowboy gathered confidence. Looking behind, he waved his hat at\nBilly.\n\n“Don’t whistle till you’re out of the woods!” yelled Billy.\n\nHe shouted something else, but his words faded out in the increasing\ndistance.\n\n“Speak to me concerning this!” laughed McGlory, straightening around in\nhis seat. “This little old chug cart is a false alarm, after all. It\nseems to understand that there’s a fellow in charge who knows the ropes\nup and down and across. Fine!”\n\n“We’ll see the owner of the machine at Krug’s,” said Matt, “and get his\naddress.”\n\n“But he can’t have the runabout till we’re done with it,” protested\nMcGlory.\n\n“I should say not! We’ve sent Billy home, and that leaves us only this\ncar to take us back. Ah, there’s Krug’s! We’ll stop for a few minutes.”\n\nMatt tried to stop, but he couldn’t. He went through all the motions\nfor cutting off the flow of gasoline and switching off the spark.\nThe clutch was out, but the engine still had the car, and the engine\nwouldn’t stop.\n\nAn automobile was just coming out of the sheds. The runabout came\nwithin an ace of a head-on collision. Fortunately the steering gear\nstill worked, and Matt scraped mud guards with the other car and he and\nhis cowboy chum bounded on along the road.\n\nMcGlory yelled frantically. “Jump!” he cried; “let the old contraption\nrun its blooming head off!”\n\nBut Matt wouldn’t jump, and he wouldn’t let his chum go over the flying\nwheels. Dazed and bewildered, he bore down on the brake.\n\nThe speed slackened, but they were half a mile beyond Krug’s before the\ncar made up its mind to stop. Then McGlory tumbled out, while Matt sat\nastounded, his arms folded over the steering wheel and such a look on\nhis face as the cowboy had never seen there before.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. A DEMON IN CONTROL.\n\n\n“Get out of that, pard! Get out!” McGlory was wild with apprehension,\nand sprang up and down at the roadside and waved his arms. “The way\nthat car acts would make the hair stand up on a buffalo robe! What are\nyou staying there for?”\n\n“I’m trying to guess how that happened,” said Matt.\n\n“Then stop guessing. You can guess till you’re black in the face and\nyou’ll still be up in the air. Cut loose from that bubble wagon--that’s\nyour cue and mine.”\n\n“There’s a reason for the car acting as it does,” declared Matt, “and\nI’m going to get down to the bottom of the mystery. We might just as\nwell put in a little time right here. It’s not a very long run to\nthe Malvern Country Club, and we can waste another half hour without\nmissing your appointment.”\n\n“If you took my advice,” muttered McGlory, “you wouldn’t touch that\nmachine with a ten-foot pole.”\n\nThere was a determined look on Matt’s face as he leaped into the road\nand began an exhaustive examination. He could find nothing wrong;\nnevertheless, he went over the ignition system carefully, step by\nstep; then he took the carburetor to pieces, ran pins through the spray\nnozzle and sandpapered the float guides; and, after that, he went under\nthe car, broke the gasoline connections and drew wires through the\ntubes.\n\nThe cowboy heaved a long breath of relief as Matt reappeared from under\nthe car.\n\n“Find anything out of whack, pard?” McGlory asked.\n\n“Not a thing,” answered the mystified Matt.\n\n“Then you’re about ready to admit there’s a demon in control of the\ncar?”\n\n“I don’t believe in demons.”\n\n“If a car won’t stop when it ought to stop, and if it won’t go straight\nwhen you’re steering that way, and if it backs up when everything is\nset for going ahead, I’m a Piute if I don’t think there’s something\nelse got a hand in running it.”\n\nMatt was silent. He was facing a proposition that was new to him,\nbut he was dealing with motor details with which he was perfectly\nfamiliar. Here was an ordinary four-cycle engine, and an ordinary\nfloat-feed carburetor; the transmission was of the common sliding-gear\nvariety; the fuel tank was under the seat, and the gasoline was fed\ninto the engine by gravity. Why was it that the different parts did not\ncoöperate as they should?\n\n“Come on, Joe,” said Matt, putting on the coat which he had laid off\nwhile at work, “we’ll go back to Krug’s and see if my tinkering has\nhelped any.”\n\n“I can’t pass up the invitation, pard,” returned McGlory, “but if any\none else gave it to me, I’d say _manana_. Every minute we’re aboard\nthat runabout, we’re sitting on a thunderbolt that’s not more than half\ntame. Here goes, anyhow.”\n\nThe cowboy climbed to his place, and Matt “turned the engine over” and\ngot in beside him. Then they backed until the runabout was headed the\nother way, whereupon Matt changed speeds and they slid over the pike as\neasily as a girl tripping to market. No. 1313 behaved like the prince\nof cars. No one, from its present performance, could ever have dreamed\nthat it was anything but the mildest-mannered little buzz wagon that\nhad ever come out of the shop.\n\n“I’m stumped,” declared McGlory. “She acts as though she had never\nthought of such a thing as taking the bit in her teeth. I reckon, pard,\nyou must have done something that started her to working in the right\nway.”\n\n“I’ll never be able to understand how she ran for half a mile without\nany gas in the cylinders or any spark to cause an explosion,” said\nMatt, as he came to a stop in front of Krug’s. “Return the rope, Joe,”\nhe added, “and see if you can find the owner of the runabout.”\n\nMcGlory was gone for ten minutes. When he came back he reported that\nthe man who had cut loose from the runabout was nowhere to be found,\nand that a fellow answering his description had been taken into a car\nby a friend and had motored off in the direction of Hempstead.\n\n“Then,” said Matt, “we’ll stop thinking about the owner of the car and\ncontinue to use it just as though it belonged to us.”\n\nThey turned south from the Corner and moved away in the direction of\nHempstead at a good rate of speed. The runabout kept up its excellent\nbehavior, answering instantly Matt’s slightest touch on steering wheel\nor levers.\n\n“You’ve got the best of her, pard,” observed McGlory. “When you\nhip-locked with her, after she ran away from Krug’s, you must have\npoked a wire into something that was causing all the trouble.”\n\n“I couldn’t have done that,” answered Matt. “Still, no matter what the\nreason, the car is acting handsomely now, and we’ll let it go at that.\nRead that telegram to me again, Joe.”\n\nMcGlory fished around in his pocket until he had brought up a folded\nyellow sheet. Opening it out, he read as follows:\n\n  “‘Meeting of syndicate in the matter of ”Pauper’s Dream“ Mine\n  postponed from Wednesday night to Thursday night. Meet me eleven\n  o’clock Thursday Malvern Country Club, near Hempstead, Long Island.\n  Important.\n\n  “‘JOSHUA GRIGGS.’”\n\nThe “Pauper’s Dream” Mine was located near Tucson, in Arizona. It was\nowned by a stock company, and the cowboy had a hundred shares of the\nstock. A friend of his, named Colonel Mark Antony Billings, had induced\nhim to invest in the “Pauper’s Dream” when it was little more than an\nundeveloped claim. Development seemingly proved the claim worthless,\nand McGlory had been surprised, while he and Matt were in New York, to\nreceive a letter stating that a rich vein had been struck, and that\nthe colonel was planning to sell the property at a big figure to a\nsyndicate of New York capitalists. Random & Griggs, brokers, in Liberty\nStreet, were the colonel’s New York agents, and the meeting of the\nsyndicate was to be held in their office.\n\nTwo bars of gold bullion from the “Pauper’s Dream” mill had been sent\nby the colonel to New York, and McGlory had been requested to get the\nbullion and exhibit it to the members of the syndicate at the meeting.\nMatt and McGlory had had a good deal of trouble with that bullion, and\nthe cowboy was not intending to take it from the bank, to whose care it\nhad been consigned, until three o’clock in the afternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, this telegram from Griggs was taking the boys to the Malvern\nCountry Club; but just why it was necessary for McGlory to talk with\nGriggs was more than either of the lads could understand.\n\n“Griggs, I reckon,” said McGlory, as he returned the telegram to his\npocket, “is one of the members of the firm of Random & Griggs.”\n\n“That’s my guess,” returned Matt; “but, if he is, why couldn’t he talk\nwith you at the office in Liberty Street instead of having you come all\nthe way out here?”\n\n“I’ll have to shy at that, pard. Maybe Griggs is a plutocrat, and is\naccustomed to having people jump whenever he cracks the whip. Like as\nnot he didn’t want to go in to the office to-day and just shot that\nmessage at us to save him the trouble of going too far for a palaver.”\n\n“He told you all it was necessary for you to know, in the message. The\nmeeting was postponed from last night to to-night. What else is there\nthat he could want to tell you?”\n\n“Pass again. Maybe he wants to ask about the colonel’s health, or----”\n\nThe cowboy bit off his words suddenly. Without the least warning, the\nrunabout had made a wild lunge toward the side of the road.\n\n“She’s cut loose again!” yelled McGlory, hanging to the seat with both\nhands.\n\nMatt was holding the steering wheel firmly. So far as he could see,\nthere was not the least excuse for the car’s making that frantic plunge\ntoward the roadside.\n\nJust ahead of the machine was a railroad track, and the noise of an\napproaching train was loud in the boys’ ears. Matt was thinking that,\nif the runabout repeated the performance it had given at Krug’s Corner,\nhe, and Joe, and the car, stood a grave chance of being hung up on the\npilot of a locomotive.\n\nBefore he could disengage the clutch or give a kick at the switch,\none of the forward wheels struck a bowlder. The car jumped, throwing\nMcGlory out on one side and Matt on the other.\n\nAs Matt fell, he caught at the two levers on the right of the driver’s\nseat and clung to them desperately. Although the car was running wild,\nwith no hand on the steering wheel, yet it bounded away along the\ncentre of the road, dragging Matt along with it.\n\nWith his elbows on the footboard, and the lower half of his body\ntrailing in the dust, Matt endeavored again and again to get back on\nthe running board and regain a grip on the steering wheel.\n\nA freight train was almost at the crossing. Unless Matt could check\nthe runabout in its wild flight, it would surely be demolished by the\nlocomotive or else hurl itself to destruction against the sides of the\nswiftly moving box cars.\n\nThe situation was desperate to the last degree. Unless he could get\nhold of the steering wheel and regain his seat, nothing could be done\nto avert the threatening catastrophe. If he let go, and abandoned the\nrunabout to its fate, he was in danger of being thrown under the racing\nwheels.\n\nA demon of perversity seemed to possess the car and to be bent upon the\ndestruction of Matt King.\n\nAgain and again the young motorist tried to reach the steering post\nwith one hand and wriggled up onto the running board. Each attempt was\nunsuccessful until a lurch of the car helped in executing the manœuvre.\n\nHanging to the wheel, Matt threw himself over the upright levers,\ndropped into the driver’s seat, disengaged the clutch and jammed both\nbrakes home.\n\nEven then he was in doubt as to whether he would succeed in stopping\nthe car. If it continued mysteriously to refuse control, there was\ncertain destruction for both Matt and the car against the side of the\ntrain, the box cars of which were already flashing over the crossing.\n\nBut the car stopped--stopped within a yard of the rushing box cars!\n\nMatt dared not throw in the reverse, fearing the machine might move\nforward instead of backward, so he dropped into the road and lay there,\npanting and exhausted, while the freight rolled on.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. THE MANILA ENVELOPE.\n\n\n“Sufferin’ doom! I’m beginning to think Billy had a bean on the right\nnumber, pard, when he said this car would have to kill somebody before\nit settled down and acted as though it was civilized.”\n\nMatt looked up and saw his cowboy chum. McGlory was rubbing a bruise on\nthe side of his face and was carrying the long manila envelope in his\nhand.\n\n“Why didn’t you let the car go to blazes?” demanded the cowboy. “What\ndid you want to hang on to it for? The best place for the blamed thing\nis the junk pile.”\n\n“I couldn’t let go without getting run over,” explained Matt, rising to\nhis feet.\n\n“Well, you’d feel a heap more comfortable under a pneumatic tire than\nyou would under a train of box cars!”\n\nMcGlory’s face was white, and his voice trembled. The strain he had\nbeen under was just beginning to tell on him.\n\n“The owner of the runabout,” he went on, “showed his good sense when he\ncut loose from it. The car’s like a broncho, Matt, and you never can\ntell when its fiendishness is going to break loose. If we had a keg of\npowder, I’m a Piegan if I wouldn’t scatter that sizz wagon all over\nthis part of Long Island.”\n\nMcGlory glared savagely at the white, innocent-looking machine.\n\nThe freight train had passed, and Matt was leaning against the car and\ncudgeling his brains to think of some reason for the runabout’s acting\nas it did.\n\n“It brought us out of Krug’s Corner as nice as you please,” he mused.\n\n“Which is just the way it took us into Krug’s Corner,” proceeded the\ncowboy. “That’s the way the pesky thing works. First it lulls you into\nthinking it wouldn’t side-step, or buck-jump, or do anything else that\nwas crooked or underhand for the world; then, when you think you’re all\nright, the runabout hauls off and hands you one. That’s the meanest\nkind of treachery--reaching out the glad hand only to land on you with\na bunch of fives. There’s something human about that car, Matt.”\n\n“Inhuman, I should say,” muttered Matt. “Well, it’s too much for me.\nGet in, Joe, and we’ll cross the track to those trees over there and\nrest up a little before we go on to the Malvern Country Club.”\n\n“Damaged much, pard?”\n\n“Jolted some, that’s all.”\n\n“Same here. I landed in the road like a thousand of brick. This is\nmy first experience with a crazy automobile, and you can bet your\nmoccasins it will be the last. I didn’t know there was such a thing.”\n\n“There isn’t,” said Matt. “How can you put together a lot of machine\nand have anything but a senseless piece of mechanism?”\n\n“I’m by, when you pin me right down, pard, but if this car isn’t\nlocoed, then what’s the matter with it?”\n\n“Something must go wrong.”\n\n“Goes wrong and then fixes itself,” jeered the cowboy. “If you’d\nlook the blamed thing over this minute, you wouldn’t be able to find\nanything out of order.”\n\nOnce more Matt started the car, and once more it acted like a sane\nand sensible machine, carrying the boys to the shade of the trees and\nstopping obediently to let them alight.\n\nMatt flung himself down on the grass at the roadside and examined his\nwatch to ascertain whether it had been injured. He found the timepiece\nin good condition.\n\n“Ten-fifteen, Joe,” he observed, replacing the watch in his vest and\nnoticing that his chum was still carrying the manila envelope in his\nhand as he sat down beside him. “What are you holding that envelope\nfor?” he inquired.\n\n“I reckon I’ve gone off the jump myself, Matt,” laughed McGlory. “It\ndropped out of my pocket when I fell into the road. I picked it up, but\nhave been too badly rattled ever since to do anything but hold it in my\nhand.”\n\nMcGlory was about to put it in his pocket when Matt suggested that he\nexamine the contents and see if he could discover the name and address\nof the man who owned the runabout.\n\nThe cowboy pulled out a couple of papers. Unfolding one of them, he\nread some typewritten words and gave a gasp and turned blank eyes on\nhis chum.\n\n“What’s wrong?” queried Matt.\n\n“Listen to this,” was the answer. “‘Private Report on the Pauper’s\nDream Mine, by Hannibal J. Levitt, Mining Engineer, of New York\nCity.’ Wouldn’t that rattle your spurs, Matt?” cried McGlory. “The\nsyndicate had an expert go out to Arizona and make an examination of\nthe ‘Pauper’s Dream,’--you remember the colonel told me about that, in\nhis letter. Here’s the report! It drops into our hands by the queerest\nhappen-chance you ever heard of. Mister Man takes a header from a crazy\nchug cart, unloads the machine onto you, and then hustles for Krug’s,\nleaving the report behind. He’s not at Krug’s when we get there, so\nthe report is left in our hands. This couldn’t have happened once in a\nmillion times, pard!”\n\nMatt was rubbing his bruised shins and allowing the amazing event to\ndrift through his brain. It was queer, there was no mistake about it.\nIn fact, all the experiences of the boys that Thursday morning were on\nthe “queer” order.\n\n“You say,” said Matt, “that the document is headed ‘Private Report.’\nWhy should it be a private report if it is for the syndicate?”\n\n“Private for the syndicate, I reckon.”\n\n“Hardly that, Joe. Unless there’s some skullduggery that report ought\nto be public property--public enough so that it could go into a\nprospectus. What’s the other paper?”\n\nMcGlory opened the other document, and found it to be a letter from\nColonel Billings, dated nearly a month previous.\n\n“It’s a letter from the colonel, Matt,” the cowboy announced, “and\nis addressed to Levitt. The colonel says he will not pay Levitt the\nbalance due until Levitt sends him the private report on the ‘Pauper’s\nDream’ proposition.”\n\n“Great spark plugs!” exclaimed Matt.\n\n“What’s strange about that?” demanded McGlory. “If Levitt made an\nexamination of the property he certainly expects pay for it.”\n\n“But not from the colonel, Joe! Levitt was examining the mine for the\nsyndicate, and he’s not entitled to any money from the colonel unless\nhe’s doing shady work of some kind.”\n\n“Speak to me about that!” muttered McGlory. “It looks as though we’d\ngrabbed a live wire when we got hold of this yellow envelope.”\n\n“I don’t like the way the business stacks up,” said Matt earnestly.\n“The owner of this troublesome runabout happens to be Hannibal J.\nLevitt, and he’s playing an unscrupulous double game. Glance through\nthat report and give me the gist of it.”\n\nEagerly--and a little apprehensively--McGlory looked through the\nprivate report. His face grew longer and longer as he read.\n\n“Sufferin’ poorhouses!” he cried at last. “Levitt says, in this report,\nthat the ‘Pauper’s Dream’ isn’t a mine, but a pocket, and that the\npocket has been worked out. In other words, pard, my hundred shares\nof stock are worth just about what they’ll bring for scrap paper.\nAnd the colonel had me worked up till I thought I was going to be a\nmillionaire! Riddle: Where was Moses when the light went out?”\n\nMcGlory fell back on the grass and kicked up his heels dejectedly.\n\n“Can’t you see through the dodge your Tucson colonel is working, Joe?”\nasked Matt.\n\n“Dodge?” echoed McGlory. “The ‘Pauper’s Dream’ is just a hole in the\nground. We can’t any of us dodge that.”\n\n“The colonel,” went on Matt quietly, “is paying Levitt to make a false\nreport to the syndicate. To-night the syndicate meets and decides\nwhether or not it will buy the ‘Pauper’s Dream.’ Levitt’s false report\nhas already been submitted, I suppose, and read. You show up at the\nmeeting with the two bars of bullion, and a sworn statement from the\ncolonel that they came out of the ten-stamp mill on the ‘Dream’ during\none week’s run. That clinches the proposition. The syndicate, relying\non Levitt’s honesty, and, incidentally, on the colonel’s, pay over a\nbig sum for a worthless hole in the ground, and----”\n\nThe cowboy leaped erect, flushed and excited.\n\n“And the colonel,” he cried, “divides the proceeds among the\nstockholders! That gives me a big profit on my five hundred. Oh, well,\nI reckon I’ve got my dipper right side up during this rain.”\n\nMcGlory chuckled. Matt stared at him as though he hardly believed what\nhe heard.\n\n“Pard,” said Matt quietly, “it’s a game of out-and-out robbery.”\n\n“That’s the syndicate’s lookout, not mine. If they want to drop half a\nmillion into that hole in the ground, what is it to me?”\n\n“I don’t think you mean that, Joe,” said Matt, getting up. “We’ll go on\nto the Malvern Country Club and find out what Griggs has to say to you.\nWe’ve got plenty of time to figure the matter over before the Syndicate\nmeets to-night.”\n\nMatt’s face was set and determined, and there was a smouldering light\nin his gray eyes, which proved that he had nerved himself for some\nduty which might be disagreeable. McGlory was wrapped in thought--so\nconcerned in his own affairs that he forgot Matt, forgot the\ntreacherous nature of the runabout, forgot everything but the “Pauper’s\nDream” and his chances for winning or losing a fortune.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. THE UNEXPECTED.\n\n\nThe unexpected happened at least twice to the motor boys between\nten-thirty and eleven o’clock that Thursday morning. First, they\nnaturally expected to have trouble with the runabout, but it carried\nout its work handsomely and deposited them in the Malvern Country Club\ngarage at precisely five minutes of eleven.\n\nThere was not much talk between the boys during the ride. McGlory\nwas concerned with his “Pauper’s Dream” reflections--and Matt had\nreflections of his own. Besides his thoughts, which were none too\nagreeable, Matt had to recall Billy’s instructions for finding the way,\nand also to be on the alert for any sudden tantrum on the part of the\nrunabout. But the tantrum did not develop, and the boys left the garage\nand made their way across the broad lawn of the clubhouse to a porch\nwhich extended along the front of the building.\n\n“I’d like to see Mr. Joshua Griggs,” said McGlory to a stout person\nwearing side-whiskers and knee breeches. The servant looked the boys\nover.\n\n“Wot nyme?” he asked.\n\n“Matt King and Joe McGlory--two nymes.”\n\n“’E’s hexpecting you. This w’y, please.”\n\nThe boys were ushered through a great apartment with a beamed ceiling\nand a fireplace that covered half of one end of the room, up a flight\nof broad stairs, and along a wide hall. Here the servant paused by a\ndoor and knocked. A mumble of voices, coming from the other side of the\ndoor, ceased abruptly.\n\n“What’s wanted?” demanded some one.\n\n“Mr. McGlory hand friend, sir.”\n\n“Send ’em in.”\n\nThe servant pushed open the door, drew to one side, and bowed the boys\nout of the hall. Then the unexpected happened for the second time.\n\nThere were two men in the room, and the atmosphere was thick with\ntobacco smoke and a reek of liquor. A box of cigars was on a table;\nalso a decanter and two glasses, a bowl of cracked ice, and a bottle of\n“fizz” water.\n\nA man was seated in a comfortable chair, rocking and smoking. This man\nwas Hannibal J. Levitt, owner of the unmanageable runabout.\n\nThe other man was tall and gaunt. He wore a black frock coat and gray\ntrousers, a flowing tie, and a big diamond in the front of his pleated\nwhite shirt. His hair was a trifle long and a trifle thin on the crown.\nA mustache spread widely from his upper lip; and a wisp of pointed\nbeard decorated his chin.\n\nThis latter individual exploded a hearty laugh as McGlory recoiled and\nstared like a person in a trance.\n\n“Howdy, son?” barked the man in the long coat, sweeping down on the\ncowboy and seizing his hand. “Something of a surprise, hey? Lookin’ for\nGriggs, by gad, and you find me!”\n\n“Colonel!” gulped McGlory. “Speak to me about this! Why, I thought you\nwere in Tucson?”\n\n“Made up my mind at the last minute that I’d better trek eastward and\nmake sure the deal for the ‘Dream’ went through.” He slapped McGlory\non the back. “A fortune, my boy, for all of us, by gad! The ‘Dream’s’\na bonanza--gold from the grass roots down. But present your friend;\npresent your friend.”\n\nThe colonel turned beamingly toward Matt.\n\n“My pard, Matt King,” said McGlory. “Everybody has heard of him, I\nreckon.”\n\n“You do me proud,” bubbled the colonel, seizing Matt’s hand and pumping\nhis arm up and down. “A friend of McGlory’s is a friend of mine. Allow\nme”--and he turned toward Levitt, only to find Levitt leaning across\nthe table, his jaws agape. “Well, well, well!” mumbled the colonel.\n“What’s flagged you, Levitt?”\n\n“We’ve met before,” grinned Levitt.\n\n“How’s that?”\n\n“These are the young fellows to whom I gave that confounded runabout.”\n\n“A conspiracy, by gad, to keep me from meeting McGlory! How’d you\nexpect him to get here in a motor wagon you couldn’t run yourself?”\n\n“I didn’t know who the lads were, colonel, or I’d have been more\nconsiderate. But”--and here he turned to Matt--“how _did_ you do it?”\n\n“We had plenty of trouble with the machine,” said Matt, “but we made it\nbring us.”\n\nThe situation was clearing. Levitt, at the time Matt and McGlory had\nmet him that morning, was also on his way to the Malvern Country Club.\n\n“Re-markable!” cooed the colonel. “But it’s a terrible land for dust,\nain’t it?” He poured something from the decanter into the glasses.\n“Irrigate!” he said. “Advance by file, my young friends, and refresh\nthe inner man.”\n\n“None for me, colonel,” answered Matt, whose opinion of the colonel was\ndropping by swift degrees.\n\n“That’s the way I stack up, too, colonel,” grinned McGlory.\n\nThe colonel looked horrified.\n\n“From Arizona, Joseph,” he murmured, “and you won’t indulge?\nEx-traordinary, I must say. Smoke?” And he indicated the box of cigars.\n\n“No, colonel,” declined Matt.\n\nA sheepish look crossed McGlory’s face as he met the colonel’s\ninquiring eye.\n\n“I’m in line with my pard,” said he.\n\n“Astounding!” gasped the colonel. “Both habits are\nreprehensible--exceedingly so. I honor you highly, my lads,\nbut--ahem!--your shining example is one by which I may not profit.” He\nturned to the mining engineer. “The fire-water is before us, Levitt,”\nsaid he; “charge!”\n\nTwo hands gripped the glasses simultaneously, and a gurgling followed.\nThe colonel dried his lips elaborately with a large yellow handkerchief.\n\n“The day, Joseph,” he resumed, “is not far distant when you can own a\nprivate yacht, a racing stable, an imported car, and a lordly mansion.\nI have come personally to New York to drive the business through and\nclinch it. To-night we show the moneyed interests what we’ve got up our\nwide and flowing sleeves. Half a million in coin, my son, will rise to\nthe bait like a speckled trout to the alluring fly. But be seated, be\nseated; let’s all be seated.”\n\nMatt took a chair by an open window, and McGlory dropped into another\nat a little distance.\n\n“The telegram I received, colonel,” observed the cowboy, “was signed\n‘Joshua Griggs.’”\n\n“Even so, my dear youth,” smiled the colonel, lowering himself into\na chair and lifting his feet to the top of the table. “Mr. Griggs\nlives in Hempstead. I am enjoying his hospitality, and he has put me\nup at this most delightful club. I arrived yesterday afternoon, and\nI yearned to clasp your honest palm before we met in Liberty Street\nto-night. Incidentally, I will relieve you of further responsibility in\nthe matter of the bullion. Being somewhat fatigued after my long and\narduous railroad journey, the Syndicate meeting was put off. To-night,\nhowever, we shall be there; and to-night, my son, we put our fortunes\nto the touch.”\n\nThe colonel was altogether too loquacious to suit Matt--too fluent and\ninsincere. That he was entirely capable of engineering a huge swindle\nMatt felt sure. And Matt regretted to note that the colonel exerted a\npowerful influence over McGlory.\n\n“Is this deal for the ‘Pauper’s Dream’ on the level, colonel?” inquired\nthe cowboy.\n\nA lighted bomb, suddenly dropped in front of the colonel and Levitt,\nwould not have caused more consternation. The colonel’s feet fell from\nthe table with a bang, and the mining engineer once more threw himself\nhalf-way across the table top.\n\nThere followed a period of silence. The colonel, after an odd look at\nLevitt, was first to speak.\n\n“McGlory,” said he, “you are my friend, and I would take a good deal\nfrom a friend. Has my integrity ever been questioned? Have you any\nreason to believe that this mining deal is not on the level?”\n\n“Shucks!” deprecated McGlory. “Is the syndicate anxious to buy a pocket\nthat’s been worked out? Have they got so much money, these Syndicate\nfellows, that they want to drop some of it into a mine that’s a ‘dream’\nin more senses of the word than one?”\n\nThis was another bomb. Levitt went white, and breathed hard. Colonel\nBillings drew a deep breath, studied McGlory’s face, and then looked at\nthe ceiling. Then once more he was first to speak.\n\n“My son,” said he, “you talk like a buck ’Pache with more tizwin aboard\nthan is good for him. And yet you must be in your sober senses. What\nare your grounds for expressing yourself in that--er--preposterous\nmanner? I wait to learn!”\n\n“Well,” answered the cowboy, “when Levitt took his header from that\nrunabout of his, on the Jericho Pike, a long yellow envelope dropped\nfrom his pocket----”\n\n“I breathe again!” interjected the colonel. “You found it, McGlory?”\n\n“That’s the size of it.”\n\n“And you read the contents of that yellow envelope?”\n\n“Matt and I wanted to find out the name of the man who owned the\nrunabout. That’s how we happened to read the ‘private report.’ It\nwasn’t good reading, colonel.”\n\n“It was for private perusal by the inner circle, my son,” said the\ncolonel. “Levitt and I were vastly worried over the loss of that\nreport. I will trouble you for it, my boy.”\n\nThe colonel reached out his hand. McGlory took the envelope from his\npocket, and was about to pass it over when Matt reached forward and\ncaught it from his fingers.\n\n“I beg your pardon,” said Matt, “but I was the one who found this\nenvelope. I gave it to Joe when I threw off my coat, east of Krug’s\nCorner, to tinker with the runabout. I am going to take care of it.”\n\nAll four were on their feet--Matt determined, McGlory puzzled and\nbewildered, the colonel wrathful, and Levitt with a dangerous gleam in\nhis eyes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.\n\n\n“Well, by gad!” exclaimed the colonel, realizing suddenly what sort of\na lad he had to deal with in Matt King.\n\n“What’s that for, pard?” inquired McGlory.\n\n“It don’t belong to you, or to McGlory, or to any one but me!” said\nLevitt. “If you try to keep that document, King, you’re nothing more\nnor less than a thief.”\n\nThe red ran into Matt’s face.\n\n“Softly, softly,” breathed the colonel. “This talk of thieves, Levitt,\nis a little premature. Matt King is a friend of McGlory’s, and he could\nnot be that if there was any yellow streak in his nature. No, by gad!\nWe are all gentlemen here. King, sir, if that manila envelope contains\npapers belonging to our mutual friend, Levitt, you will return them to\nhim, will you not?”\n\n“After a while,” said Matt; “not immediately.”\n\nThe colonel seemed thunderstruck.\n\n“You hear?” muttered Levitt, between his teeth. “He’s trying to play\ndouble with us, Billings! Those papers mean a whole lot to me, and I’m\ngoing to have them!”\n\nThe colonel’s mood underwent a change. Attempts at conciliation having\nfailed, there now remained nothing but vigorous action. His first move\nwas to pass rapidly to the door, turn a key in the lock, and drop the\nkey into his pocket. Then he once more approached Matt.\n\n“May I inquire, young man,” he bristled, “what you mean by this most\nremarkable conduct?”\n\n“I’m trying to protect Joe and myself,” Matt answered.\n\n“Protect? Protect yourself and Joe against what, in Heaven’s name?”\n\n“Against being drawn into a criminal act by you and Levitt, and being\ncompelled to take the consequences.”\n\n“He talks like a fool!” snapped the mining engineer.\n\n“He is misinformed, that’s all,” said the colonel.\n\n“I’m not misinformed,” went on Matt sturdily. “These New York\ncapitalists hired Levitt to go to Arizona and investigate the ‘Pauper’s\nDream.’ He made two reports, one private and the other for the members\nof the Syndicate. One says the mine is no good, and the other, of\ncourse, gives it a glittering recommendation.”\n\n“How do you know,” asked Levitt, his voice sha\n", "final_result_str": "repair", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "6a0a7117-8eb0-4d47-8d78-1f03cd98c967", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "need_repair", "evidence": "特殊内容：前置书籍格式性内容，后面正常书籍"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "70400336-a0df-47a8-b0f6-eedc21488be1", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "书籍"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "bf048248-47d1-4672-97e3-693b0cb02ad9", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "- 文学作品，但上下文难理解"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "3cf19fbc-66af-411f-883b-94eeecb99ad7", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "正常的小说"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

They happen so effortlessly and without warning that they often pass by unrecognised. They visit the humblest as well as the most powerful, without prejudice or favour, and defy all logic and rational explanation.\n\nThis is my fourth book on healing. In a career spanning over two decades as a journalist and writer, and having led a peripatetic life spanning continents, I have been privy to the most mundane, the colossally bizarre, the malignantly morbid, the ludicrously humorous and the profoundly soul elevating. I have spent quality time on the streets and in brothels and the corridors of the dispossessed while attempting to document their angst and joy. Miracles kept happening in their lives and in mine, in fact all around us, but we simply bypassed their pedigree, remained connected to the real world of cause and effect, and pronounced our everyday judgements.\n\nBut it was while researching the process of healing that I fully realised the miracles that were happening in our lives almost all the time. Our bodies are a miracle, birth and death are miracles, and the whole process of healing is a miracle. It is easy to pass it all off as 'holistic healing', the 'mind-body connection' and with other similar jargon. Conventional and alternative medicine men also take recourse in rational explanations, but they know that, beyond a point, remissions happen and healing occurs without easy explanation. It is then passed off as divine intervention.\n\nOver the years I have also experimented with several healing techniques. Most of them work, but for different people and at different times. If they don't work for a particular person, it doesn't mean that the technique or the therapy is wrong. It is just that the person and the time are not right... or that the person is not yet ready to be the medium.\n\nI have also been practising yoga and meditation for over a decade and have been privileged to spend huge quality time with several masters. There are several days during the practice when your entire being is elevated and you feel an endless joy floating through you. If you were to jot down the period with pen and paper, the milestones would be no different from the saddest periods of your life or even the most ordinary ones. Yet, there is an inexplicable joy that transports your being into a cascade of sheer ecstasy.\n\nMudras - as you will read in the book - are simple, free and easy to do. They can be done anywhere and they heal the body. I am not, at any stage, suggesting that you do away with your doctor and his prescriptions. But regular practise of Mudras has been shown to heal conclusively.\n\nSeveral explanations are offered for the healing that takes place. But as you get regular with the practice, you begin to knock at the doors of an inner spirituality. With time, you are transformed from deep within at the cellular level. You begin to respect your body more and look at all life with new admiration. Slowly, you begin to give in to the powerful and comforting embrace of existence. You know, somehow, that it will take care of you.\n\nWelcome to Mudras, healing, and the new you!\n\n_—Rajendar Menen_\n\n# **Acknowledgements**\n\nThis book would not have been possible without the help of several practitioners of Mudra healing. Not much documentation is available but I tapped all sources I could lay my hands on. A very special note of gratitude to Gertrude Hirschi for her humbling and illuminating insights into the subject. She is blessed and is a true Messiah of healing. It is unfortunate that all these truisms from ancient India need the western world to document, perfect and improve upon. But now that they have done it, let the seeds scatter and pollinate the land. This is sharing at its profoundest.\n\n# **Understanding Mudras**\n\nIt is widely believed that the human structure is a miniature form of the universe that is made up of five elements - fire, air, water, earth and sky. These elements are present in fixed proportions and even the slightest imbalance of any of these can be disastrous.\n\n**Vajrapradama Mudra**\n\nMudras help normalise the five elements in the human body. Nature has made the human body self-sufficient, self-contained and almost perfect. But a human being is prone to innumerable pressures. The food we eat, the air we breathe, the water we drink, and even our thoughts are in no way compatible with what can be called the ideal way of life. Since there is no equilibrium, as the body and mind are at war with so many external and internal pressures, we fall ill. Our bodies are in a constant state of flux, recharging and rebalancing all the time. When there is an imbalance we fall ill.\n\nThe balance we aspire to and need is a tricky business. Anything can upset it. From loneliness, break-ups in relationships, shifting house, even examination failure and not reaching peer group expectations, to name just a few, to the insidious attacks from viruses and germs that room with us on this planet. All mandatory props for a healthy life have been devalued today. The water we drink, the food we eat, and even the air we breathe has been compromised. We have moved far away from nature, and the germs and the human body that host them have also mutated several times. It is so very easy now to lose balance, to fall from grace so to say.\n\nWe will now examine how Mudras influence the human being. The five fingers of the hand represent the elements. The thumb represents fire, the forefinger air, the middle finger sky, the third or ring finger earth and the fourth finger water.\n\n\"Hands have a power of their own,\" says Acharya Keshav Dev, a well-known practitioner. \"Through the regular practise of various Mudras, a person can control his life.\"\n\nDirector of the Vivekanand Yogashram in Delhi, soft spoken, articulate and extremely knowledgeable, the Acharya can talk endlessly and with authority on the science of Mudras. About _hasta mudras_ (hand postures), the Acharya says that there is a tremendous flow of energy in our hands and each finger represents one of the five elements - the thumb is _agni_ (fire), the forefinger is _vayu_ (air), the middle finger is _akash_ (ether), the ring finger is _prithui_ (earth) and the little finger is _jal_ (water). \"The roots of all diseases lie in an imbalance of one of the five elements and can be corrected with medicines, willpower and Mudras,\" he says. \"The science of Mudras is one of the finest gifts of yoga to the cause of human welfare.\"\n\nThe Acharya explains that Mudras are universal and suitable for everyone. They can be practised for half-an-hour everyday. It is advisable to sit cross-legged while doing a Mudra, but he adds that the Mudra will not be rendered ineffective even if it is done while on a stroll with the hands casually tucked in the pockets, fingers folded in a particular Mudra. They can also be done lying down, and so are easy to do.\n\nMudras never generate an excess of energy, he continues. Like a thermostat, they simply seek an optimal balancing of _prana_. So the next time you are ailing, remember it may just be an instance of maladjusted _prana_ and an innocuous sleight of hand could be the cure!\n\nMudras are yoga movements involving only the arms and hands. They are extremely easy to do, but so powerful that they can transform one's life. They liberate the energy locked within your body - in energy channels called _nadis_ and energy centres called _chakras_. Mudras help create inner peace and inner strength, eliminate fatigue and anxiety, protect physical and emotional health, help transcend stress, depression, guilt and anger, calm the mind and sharpen intuition, and promote happiness, love, prosperity and longevity.\n\nConsidering the ease with which Mudras can be done, the little time and space they consume, and the enormous benefits associated with them at no extra cost whatsoever, it may just be the valuable tool to good health and mental peace that we need so urgently in a life that is so frenetically hurtling away from any type of balance. No previous experience with yoga is needed to do Mudras. You don't have to be an athlete or be youthful either. In fact, Mudras can be done even from the sick bed. All you need to do is move your arms and hands freely and pay attention to your breathing. This is as simple as it can get. And you enrich your life - wherever you are - in as little as a few minutes a day.\n\nIn a modest, nondescript apartment at Juhu Gully in suburban Mumbai, 64-year-old Ramesh Shah practises Mudras everyday and also teaches them to those who are interested. \"It is a simple way of preserving one's health and my goal is to spread the message to all those who need it,\" he says.\n\nRamesh Shah\n\nShah, who used to run \"a mechanical workshop\", suffered from high blood pressure and gastric complaints. He met a Mudra teacher who explained the Mudras to him. Shah tried it, was cured of his problems, and there was no looking back. \"It is a free medicine/' he says happily. \"You don't have to go to hospital. You save a lot of money.\"\n\nSerene and scholarly, Shah explains _Prana Mudra_ or the Mudra for life energy: \"Bend the little and ring fingers so that their tips touch the tip of the thumb. As simple as that.\" The benefits include an increase in the life force, improvement in eyesight, blood circulation and immune function. \"In the _Varun Mudra_ , put the tips of the thumb and little finger together,\" he says. \"It will cure impurities of the blood and skin and stomach problems.\"\n\nThe _Gyan Mudra_ is equally simple and effective. \"Gently touch the thumb with the index finger. This will help in improving the power of the mind. In the _Jalodhar Naashak Mudra_ the little finger should touch the mount of the thumb and the thumb should touch the little finger. This Mudra is good for water retention in the body,\" Shah avers.\n\nRamesh Shah claims to know over 45 Mudras. He believes that no particular pose is essential for Mudras but it is \"good to place a mat or cloth on the floor and sit in _Padmasan_ or _Vajrasan_ positions. But Mudras can be done standing, sitting and even walking\".\n\nHe then talks about the _Akash Mudra:_ \"Touch the middle finger with the thumb. It increases the person's intuition, cures calcium deficiency, tooth and ear problems.\"\n\n_(We detail all the Mudras comprehensively later on in the book. Please remember that though Mudras are effective and useful in treating various health problems, don't stop medication without consulting your physician. Practitioners offen mention patients who started the Mudras and then slowly discontinued the medication without any adverse effects. In fact, they say that over a period of time the Mudras cure the patients completely. But please check with your attending doctor before discontinuing any medication.)_\n\nAfter almost a decade of practise, Ramesh Shah believes that _Gyan Mudra, Vayu Mudra_ and _Prana Mudra_ can be done everyday. \"The other Mudras should be done only when you are suffering from a certain problem. They should be done for a maximum of fifteen minutes three times a day/' he advises.\n\nShah believes that it is best to do the Mudras on an empty stomach but _\"Vayu Mudra_ can be done soon after eating as it eliminates gastric problems\".\n\nShah concludes with _Vayu Mudra:_ \"It is incredible. The body is controlled by five elements. All the energy is in the fingers. Through different combinations of the fingers, we can not only control these elements but also cure many diseases.\"\n\n# **Ancient Healing Rediscovered**\n\nNot far away, in Malad, another Mumbai suburb, is 62-year-old Yogi Kumar who teaches yoga and healing Mudras. He was in the garments business and took to teaching yoga full-time after retirement a few years ago.\n\n\"I have over 40 years' experience/' he reveals. \"I learnt yoga at Mathura. In fact, I started meditation from the age of four. My father was also a yoga teacher. I am blessed with intuition. Even at a young age I could guess all the questions in my examination papers. I knew I had some power and I kept working hard at it to reach a position of strength. After my professional life was stabilised I thought I should spread the message of good health in society.\"\n\nA vegetarian, Yogi Kumar does yoga and over 20 Mudras every day. \"It takes over an hour-and-a-half/' he says. \"I then travel all over the city to meet patients. I charge about three hundred rupees per patient per day but it all depends on the distance I have to travel and the type of disease I am treating.\"\n\nYogi Kumar insists that any disease can be cured through Mudras. He says that he has treated asthma, arthritis, cardiac problems, kidney disease, sexual problems, migraines, back complaints and even the dreaded and largely incurable blood cancer.\n\n\"This is not a boast,\" he insists. \"There are two types of Mudras - body Mudras and hand postures. Mudras are ancient. It began with Lord Shiva and it is all documented in his conversations with his consort Parvati. It is an ancient science and is easy and free. No medicines are needed and the cure is hundred per cent. But the patient should follow my instructions to the letter. I am very strict about that. If all my instructions are obeyed, I can guarantee a cure.\"\n\nThere are other practitioners too spread out in different parts of India. But the knowledge of Mudras is scanty and there is no common thread that runs through them. Since healing through Mudras is unconventional medicine at best and receives no official patronage, it is left to isolated believers to propagate it. Like several other healing systems that originated in the folds of time, Mudras have not been subject to scientific scrutiny. There is no documentation either but verbal testimonies to its efficacy are rampant and that's why the usefulness of Mudras is still alive and in our midst.\n\nThis is a common problem with all the ancient healing techniques which are not profit centres. An old and rich civilisation like India has several such healing techniques but they are constantly 'discovered' by the western world, patented abroad by them and resold to us!\n\nAs I write this, reports have streamed in that _Jeevani -_ the energy herb from Kerala that was discovered by local tribals - has now been patented by the west. This has happened to several other ayurvedic formulations as well. Even Indian dance and music has been researched extensively and given new dimensions. Ditto with yoga, massage techniques and other holistic remedies. Mudras have already entered the western world. It won't be long before the whole world gets to know of them in their new, revised and more potent forms.\n\n\"It is only because there is no money in it that it is not well known or developed,\" claim practitioners. \"There is big money in allopathy and hospitals. Who will promote something which is free?\"\n\nThe flip side is that without documentation and further research, the science may hit a roadblock in terms of evolution. Mudras heal. There is no question about that. But delving into its methodology and formulating newer techniques to harness the gigantic power in our fingers may certainly be invaluable.\n\nAll the ancient healing techniques like ayurveda, massage, yoga and the like have been subject to intensive research. The human body has also changed over time. We hope that after reading this book, efforts are made to propagate and document a healing methodology which is ideal for a developing country - it is free, takes hardly any time, can be done anywhere, requires no gadgetry, cures almost all diseases, and helps keep the body and mind in a continuous state of calm. It originated in India and has lived with us for thousands of years. Can there be better reasons to popularise Mudras and make them a household healing regimen?\n\n# **Some Interesting Facts**\n\nAll godly and superhuman persons like Lord Mahavir, Gautam Buddha, Adi Shankaracharya and others would remain in these Mudras. Mudras are simple yogic functions with enormous significance. Detailed descriptions of Mudras are found in _Tantra Shastra, Upasana Shastra, Nritya Shastra_ , and several other ancient treatises.\n\n  Mudras can bring about miraculous changes and improvement in our body.\n\n  Mudras generate power to provide peace and happiness.\n\n  Mudras are miraculous remedies. They provide instant relief in many illnesses.\n\n  Mudras can cure almost any ailment from simple earache to heart attack.\n\n  Mudras help in moulding the physical, mental and even the moral aspects of an individual.\n\n  Some Mudras can balance the elements of the body within 45 minutes while others act within a few seconds.\n\n  Practise of some Mudras on a regular basis can cure insomnia, arthritis and memory loss.\n\n  Mudras bring about a fundamental revision of the destructive changes in the human body. They also develop piety and a courteous disposition.\n\n  Mudras help in Kundalini Yoga to awaken the cosmic energy.\n\n# **Mudras and Dance**\n\nMudras or 'sign language' is the most important element of dance. So much is conveyed in dance and, yet, no copious sentences are uttered. If dance is the language, Mudras are the words used in that language. Mudras are formed with the fingers of either a single hand or both the hands. The dancer conveys whatever he or she wants to and effectively too with various contortions of the arms and the fingers. All dance is evocative and rich in articulation and yet nothing much is said verbally. All communication is with signs, gestures and movements. It is powerful body language that is universal and floral in expression.\n\nThere are two kinds of Mudras. One is formed by the use of a single hand and the other is formed by using both the hands. _Asamyukta hastam_ means single-hand Mudras and _Samyukta hastam_ refers to Mudras formed by using both the hands. _Samyukta_ literally means 'joined'. There are 28 single-hand Mudras and 24 double-hand ones. Let's look at a few single-hand Mudras.\n\nBend the right ring finger to half its length. Let it touch the thumb. Keep the other three fingers vertically erect. This is the _Mayura Mudra_ or the peacock sign. It represents the peacock and also expresses vomiting, pushing back one's hair, applying 'tilak' on one's forehead, taking water from a holy river and sprinkling on one's head, teaching _(upadesa)_ , and several other messages too, which also includes the most common one of appreciation. As you can see, a simple gesture, an almost insignificant movement of the finger, can say so much.\n\nLet's take it further. The opposite feelings of friendship and enmity are also expressed with a single double-hand Mudra. The only difference is in the fingers. Close all the fingers of both hands, except the forefingers. Bend both the forefingers like hooks and place them opposite each other. Move them away, in opposite directions and they are like two enemies facing each other. Now fold all the fingers except the little fingers of both hands. Bend them to form a hook and place them against each other. Now you represent two friends. In both these Mudras, the left hand is held above the right hand.\n\nWithout the use of words, these Mudras convey so much. Imagine what a combination of them would say!\n\nA powerful example of the use of Mudras is in _Kathakali_ (\"story play\"), the globally acclaimed classical dance drama of Kerala, which dates to the 17th century and is deeply rooted in Hindu mythology. _Kathakali_ has a unique combination of literature, music, painting, acting and dance.\n\n_Kathakali_ draws heavily from drama and is danced with elaborate masks and costumes. It is both emotive and narrative and combines dance with dialogue to bring myth and legend to life in the temple courtyards of Kerala. The dancers use their stunning costumes and make-up, to the accompaniment of drums and vocalists, to create various moods and emotions.\n\n_Kathakali_ is spellbinding. It has a harmonious combination of literature _(Sahithyam)_ , music _(Sangeetham)_ , painting _(Chithram)_ , acting _(Natyam)_ and dance _(Nritham)_. The costumes are vivid and colourful, the facial make-up is done by the artist himself and a distinct headgear made of wood is worn during the play. The _Aharya_ (make-up) has many faces like _Pacha, Kathi, Thadi, and Minukku_ etc.\n\nIn _Kathakali_ the dancers do not speak, but their hand movements or Mudras, along with facial expressions, speak several volumes. Frenzied drumming and a preamble-like musical note called _Thiranottam_ pitches this exquisite form of dance, which lasts all through the night, into the realm of fantasy.\n\nThere are 24 basic Mudras (hand gestures) in the _Hasthalakshana Deepika_ , the Book of Hand Gestures, which _Kathakali_ follows. There are _Asamyukta Mudras_ (with one hand) and _Samyukta Mudras_ (with both hands) in each basic Mudra. The Mudras and their separations total 470 symbols.\n\n_Kathakali_ is only one example. But all other dance forms too are replete with the silent eloquence of Mudras.\n\nPadma Shree Dr Kanak Rele, who runs the Nalanda Dance Research Centre at Juhu in Mumbai, explains that it is not possible to count the number of _hastas_ or Mudras in dance. \"Each dance style has its own system and categories of _hastas,\"_ she says. \"But each system has basic _hastas_ from which a number of different _hastas_ are created by permutations and combinations. For example, every dance style uses the basic _hasta_ called _Pataaka_ (flag). They may be performed in different ways by using the fingers vis-à-vis the palm in different ways. In _Kathakali_ , which uses the Sanskrit text, _Hastalakshanadeepika, Pataaka_ is to be held by keeping the palm straight, the fingers completely extended and then bending the ring finger at the middle joint. It can be held by both the hands, which would be called _Samyukta_. If it is done with only one hand it would then be called _Asamyukta.\"_\n\nDr Kanak Rele\n\nWinner of several awards, Dr Rele is well known for reestablishing the exquisitely lyrical dance of _Mohini Attam_ and for introducing new vistas to research in classical dance. She is also credited with pioneering work into the dynamics of Indian dance, which resulted in her theory on the Body Kinetics of dance.\n\n\"The usages of _Samyukta_ are many/' she continues. \"By placing each hand at different places in the spaces around the body one can create the sun, king, elephant, lion, _torana_ (flower garlands for doors), bullock, crocodile and so on. With the _Asamyukta_ , the language of dance continues. It is different. _Bharata Natyam_ uses the Sanskrit text _Abhinayadarpana_ in which the _Pataaka hasta_ is to be held by keeping the palm straight with all the fingers extended and the thumb touching the palm. So with permutations and combinations, hundreds of _hastas_ or Mudras are created.\"\n\nThe origins of Mudras are not really clear. Most dance teachers and Mudra practitioners agree that it is ancient but there is no consensus on dates. _\"Hastas_ originated when the need for stylisation in a dramatic presentation was felt,\" says Dr Kanak Rele. \"This stylisation was codified so that a single system originally arose to encompass the different parts of ancient India. This made the practice universal. Since there are no words spoken in dance, the dancer has to interpret the words of the song with _hastas_ and suitable facial expressions.\"\n\n_Hastas_ are very eloquent and are profound in their communication. They are the words of dance. They form alphabets, and their permutations, as has been illustrated, create words for nouns, actions, qualities and things. \"They can mirror life or even articulate abstractions,\" points out Dr Rele. \"These _hastas_ are individual words which are to be used appropriately in sentences. So each sentence will have different _hastas_ strung together.\"\n\nMudras are very Indian. They probably spread to other parts of the world from here. \"In south-east Asian dances one finds a few rudimentary or truncated _hastas_. I have seen some symbolic, standardised hand movements in Hawaiian dances, which are not really _hastas_. But they are not found anywhere else in the world/' says Dr Kanak Rele with some finality. After immersing herself in dance for over four decades with aplomb, she should know.\n\n# **Meaning and Purpose of Mudras**\n\nThe word _Mudra_ literally means _seal_. It has a number of different connotations in yoga, which include _bandhas_ (locks) and meditation practices. However, Mudras are most commonly associated with hand gestures. The fingers are related to different types of energies, and when they are brought together in specific ways, they produce subtle effects.\n\nMudras can help balance the flow of energy through the _nadis_ that nourish our internal organs. They can also be performed to achieve specific states of consciousness. They also help eliminate negative thought forms and aid mood elevation.\n\nNow that the basic introduction is done, we present a few Mudras developed by Kareena who teaches yoga and leads energy and posture workshops in the United States. Normally, no specific positions are required but in this case they should ideally be practised with the spine and head erect. The eyes are focused downward toward the nostrils or at the Sun centre between the eyebrows to activate the third eye. It may also be helpful if the feet touch the floor or if the practitioner assumes a half or full lotus position. These Mudras are easy to do and can change our lives forever if done regularly.\n\n## Mudra for Trust\n\nLift hands overhead and place right palm over back of left hand. (Reverse hands for men.) Elbows bend softly and shoulders press down away from ears. Imagine creating a triangle over your _crown chakra_ in an attempt to connect to it. Breathe short, fast breaths of fire, while focusing on the navel, to build inner trust.\n\n## Mudra for Joy\n\nBend elbows and open arms to side. Position hands at shoulder level with palms facing forward. Press the little and ring fingers down into palms and cross your thumb tightly over them. Lift middle and index fingers straight up toward the heavens like the peace sign. Inhale slowly for eight counts. Exhale for eight counts. Smile as you feel the glow of your inner light.\n\n## Mudra for Recharging\n\nFist your right hand with thumb pointing upwards. Wrap your left palm around the right hand's first, thumb pointing upwards. Touch the two thumbs together, straighten elbows and push arms and hands away from chest. Feel the left hand resisting the strong push of the right fist. Push shoulders back to increase resistance. Avoid hunching shoulders; keep chest and rib cage lifted. Focusing eyes on thumbs, inhale slowly for eight counts and exhale for eight counts. Feel energy radiating from base of spine into hands and arms as you recharge.\n\n# **The Practise of Visualisation**\n\nThe power of visualisation is well known. Powerful positive visualisation done everyday can empower the practitioner to perform extraordinary feats. One's personal window to the world emanates from self-esteem and self-belief. If you feel you can, YOU CAN. Visualisation is not only about Mudras. They go a long way even in everyday life.\n\nThe _chakras_ are regarded as the centres of psychic energy. If you visualise with clarity and intensity, you can become what you visualise. Of course, it is not as simple as that. Miracles would take place if visualisation were so easy. But with a great deal of sustained and honest practise, a person can become well and whole by simply visualising Wellness.\n\nSimilarly, if you visualise sickness, you promote an aura of sickness within you and literally fall ill. All of us live a portion of our lives in fantasy. We, at times, start believing what we are intrinsically not, almost to the point of delusion, but with sustained affirmation, we even become it. So much for the power of the mind. It creates matter, and then decomposes it with the power of thought.\n\nLet's move on to more spiritual aspects relevant to yoga and the Mudras. For example, when you contemplate and visualise the earth centre your whole being becomes that earth centre. When you become one with space, the body is said to \"disintegrate\". In infinite space, one sees what can only be described as \"lightning\", or the _ajna chakra_. With well-directed visualisation even chronic problems can be cured both of the mind and the body because the connection between the two is profound.\n\nYou simply have to merge completely with whatever it is that you are visualising and strongly affirm positivity at a deep cellular level. A feeling of bliss will consume you. You will radiate joy, and be one with your inner and outer selves. With the right mind-body connection, holistic healing will be born.\n\nRecent research has shown that people with depression have increased mortality after heart attacks and it is not linked to smoking or sedentary behaviour. The part of the nervous system that regulates heart rates works differently in depressed people, and their abnormal platelets may cause arterial blockage.\n\nFor centuries, the mind-body connection has come in for intense scrutiny. First, the pineal gland was considered the link between body and soul, and later it was the pituitary gland. In the new medical model, the mind and body are seen as parts of a single system. We now believe that nature has used the same molecules for a multitude of purposes in both brain and body. When something goes awry with their production in the brain, it will show in other body parts as well.\n\nToday, new technology can visualise the functioning of the depressed brain. Areas that are barely working appear as ragged holes. Body functions collapse under depression and stress. The immune system breaks down and we fall prey to innumerable diseases. Take a break, get happy ad the body gets revitalised. So often, people fall sick and yet their medical tests show that nothing is wrong with them. The medical fraternity is at a loss to explain this. Then, with time, the emotions get sorted out, and they are inexplicably well again.\n\nAnimals express this body-mind connection without inhibition.\n\nGertrude Hirschi, an authority on Mudras, writes about the visualisation necessary for the _Lotus Mudra_. She says, \"Imagine the bud of a lotus flower in your heart. Every time you inhale, the flower opens a bit more - until it finally is completely open and can absorb the full sunlight into itself. It lets itself be filled with light, lightness, warmth, love, desire and joy.\" Along with this is the affirmation: \"I open myself to nature; I open myself to the good that exists in every human being; and I open myself to the Divine so that I will be richly blessed.\"\n\nTo charge oneself with energy, Gertrude recommends the following visualisation while doing the _Shiva linga_. \"Imagine that your left hand is a mortar and your right hand is a pestle. During the first breaths, mentally let whatever makes you sick fall like dark pebbles into your left hand. With the edge of your right hand, grind everything into the finest dust, which you then blow away from your hand like fine sand. Afterwards, remain seated for a while and let healing energy flow into the bowl formed by your hand (your energy reservoir) through the right thumb.\" Fervently speak the following affirmation several times: \"Healing light illuminate every cell of my body, dissolve everything that should be dissolved, and build up what must be built up again. Thank you!\"\n\nWhile doing the _Joint Mudra_ for more flexibility, Gertrude says, \"Visualise images where you completely enjoy your flexibility; you easily and freely move your legs and arms, feet and hands, head and neck. You see yourself as a dancer, athlete or performer and feel how your energy flows and your mood improves.\" The affirmation she suggests: \"I enjoy my flexibility. It uplifts my soul and stimulates my mind.\"\n\nIn this manner, every Mudra is accompanied by profound visualisation and an affirmation. All the visualisations and affirmations are Mudra-specific. But they are all positive, uplifting and energising and take you to newer reaches of self-discovery and growth. It's about telling yourself to believe in what you thought was impossible all this while. It is similar to whatever else you do in life. Faith works wonders. Adopt a winner's attitude. Believe that you will come out on top, and you will. Focus on your weaknesses and failure, and you are beaten. So why not do suitable healing Mudras, visualise Wellness, affirm it, and come out whole and well and the better for it?\n\nVisualisation is used in several other spheres as well. It is an important tool while recuperating from surgery. It's an intrinsic asset for achievers in any field and most particularly in sport where one coasts along during the 'wall' phase and lifts oneself in the 'zone' to superhuman effort. The loneliness of the marathon runner is legendary, a loneliness wherein he lives only with the dream. It is common with all sport; the more dangerous it gets, the greater the role of the mind. Even in war, battle indoctrination transforms a simple goatherd into a fighting machine. So much for the mind!!\n\nThere are some techniques laid out in the _Hatha Yoga Pradipika_ and the _Gerandha Samhita_ , which aid visualisation in _chakra_ meditation.\n\n# **Practising Mudras**\n\nMany Mudras are normally associated only with the hands. Several Mudras have been preserved in Indian dancing or as symbols, the most famous of which is the _Chit-mudra_ , which denotes _chit_ or wisdom of the highest consciousness. But for the yogi the word _Mudra_ translates as _seal;_ the 'seal' that closes and safeguards.\n\nMudras are said to awaken the _kundalini_ energy. They can be practised either before or after other yoga practices like _pranayama_ or _asanas_. Mudras can be practised without any difficulty. The practice of _maha-mudra_ is especially easy to do. _Maha-mudra_ is performed to aid visualisation of the _sushumna_.\n\nTo perform it, simply sit on the ground, and place the left heel on the perineum, being careful not to sit on it. The right leg is kept straight and at a right angle to the body. Clasp your right foot with both hands, not merely touching the foot but holding it firmly. Concentrate within, turning your attention to the eyebrow centre.\n\nNow fix your gaze inwards, and clearly visualise the _sushumna nadi_ as a radiant shell running vertically through the centre of your body from top to bottom. Inhale. Do _jalandhara-bandha_ (dropping the chin and pressing it firmly to the chest), and hold the breath, continuing to visualise the _sushumna nadi_. The visualisation is only of the psychic tube and not of the individual _chakras_. Since the heel of the foot is on the perineum, and since your attention has also been focused on the eyebrow centre, you are immediately aware of where the _sushumna_ begins and ends.\n\nAfter holding the breath to your capacity, raise the chin and exhale slowly. This is the first half of the procedure. Repeat it but this time place the left leg out straight and the right foot on the perineum. This is the second half of one complete round of the _maha-mudra_. If necessary, do several complete rounds of _maha-mudra_. It may be necessary to visualise the _sushumna_ clearly.\n\nAfter finishing with _maha-mudra_ , perform what is called _maha-bandha_. Place the left heel against the perineum. Place the right foot on the left thigh. Inhale, do the chin lock, and place the palms on the floor. As part of the _maha-bandha_ , you should perform the _mula-bandha_ , contracting the muscles to close or \"bind\" the anus while also contracting the muscles in such a way so as to pull up the alimentary canal. This _mula-bandha_ must be firmly kept while you continue with the _maha-bandha_. Contemplation is of the eyebrow centre. And as in _maha-mudra_ , you visualise the _sushumna_. As before, you raise the chin, and exhale slowly.\n\nFinally, still assuming the _maha-bandha_ , you perform the _maha-uedha_. Take a deep breath and hold it and, while dropping the chin again into _jalandhara-bandha_ , you lift and raise your buttocks off the ground, your two palms pushing you from the ground. Then drop the buttocks, letting it gently strike the floor. _Maha-mudra, maha-bandha_ , and _maha-uedha_ are all three parts of one exercise and are practised together.\n\nAll three produce some effects upon the perineum. These are performed because they help create sensitivity about the beginning of the _sushumna_. The eyebrow centre is the terminus of the _sushumna_. The concentration should be free to move through the entire field of the _sushumna_ because the _sushumna_ is not just top, middle, and bottom, but one field, one _sushumnal_ Therefore, this meditation, like all meditation, is not fixed upon a point. In meditation, the _chitta_ or mind is not fixed upon one thing; there is movement! The movement may be limited to the extent that the meditation is upon the _sushumna_ only, but there is no limit on the movement of consciousness within that field. The only thing limited is the field of attention.\n\nThe _kechari-mudra_ is very popular. It is said to promote concentration. It involves rolling the tongue back so that it touches the posterior nares. This may not be easy to do. Other yoga texts like the _Gerandha Samhita_ suggest the _nabho-mudra_ where the tongue is turned back onto the palate towards the uvula as far as it will go. It is believed that mental agitation ceases when the tip of the tongue is turned up and back. _Nabho-mudra_ is considered a substitute for _kechari-mudra_.\n\n_Yoni-mudra_ is excellent for meditation upon the _chakras_ because it completely blocks out or seals off all distractions. It gets its name _yoni_ , meaning \"uterus\", because like the baby in the uterus, the practitioner has no external contact with the world and, therefore, no externalisation of consciousness. The physical posture that is recommended is _siddhasana_ because it is considered the best for sealing off the lower apertures. If _siddhasana_ is not possible, try _padmasana_.\n\nThe yogi then seals all the upper apertures. First, the ear holes are closed by putting the thumbs in the ears. Keep your back straight. Next close the eyelids, and place the tips of the index fingers on them. If the eyeballs feel disturbed by the pressure of the finger on the eyelids, try drawing the eyelid down with the index fingers so that the only place where the fingers apply pressure is just below the eyes (at the cheekbone). The middle fingers push in on the nostrils. The ring fingers rest on the upper lip, while the little fingers rest under the lower lip. Each elbow should be pointed outwards: the right at a ninety- degree angle to your right side, and the left elbow at a ninety-degree angle to your left side. Keep them in this position throughout, i.e., do not let them drop. You are allowed to prop them up with something if necessary.\n\nSerious practitioners use a t-shaped stick called a _yoga-danda_ , which keeps the elbows stationary. By putting pressure on the armpit, the _yoga-danda_ is also supposed to change the flow of energy in the _nadis_. This would be desirable if the alteration of the flow of energy, which in a healthy person has its own natural rhythm of alternation, had somehow become restricted due to some disturbance somewhere in the body-mind complex. If this were to happen, the normal regulation of energy from one side of the body to the other would be very sluggish and the flow on one side would dominate for quite longer than usual. To help counter this, the _yoga-danda_ is placed under the armpit on the side in which the energy flow is dominant. If the energy flow is dominant on the left (the _Ida)_ , the yogi places the _yoga-danda_ under the armpit on the left side, and the flow will begin to shift, and will eventually start flowing in the _pingala nadi_ on the right side.\n\nThere are two variations in the technique of breathing while doing the _Yoni Mudra_. The first is simply to stop pinching the nostrils with your middle fingers when you wish to breathe in and out. In the other procedure, the nostrils are held tightly shut. The ring and little fingers stay put also, but the lips open as if you are pouting, or, as if you are about to whistle. Breathing through the mouth is recommended in the _Gerandha Samhita_ , and is known as _Kaki Mudra_. Some teachers like Swami Sivananda recommend breathing through the nose. The practitioner should choose the most convenient method.\n\nIn _Yoni Mudra_ , the yogis do not suggest any ratio for the inhalation-retention-exhalation of the breath. Don't be concerned with how long you prolong the inhalation-exhalation. As with most of the yoga practices, here the retention of the breath is important. Hold the breath for as long as you like. And, as you hold the breath, concentrate and visualise each _chakra_ singularly, and for some time, visualising, for example, the four-petalled _chakra_ with the yellow square at the place where the body touches the ground. You visualise the two deities, and everything else in the descriptions that you have been given, and repeat the mantra, etc., until you are one with that earth centre, and become absorbed in it. The consciousness then moves up to the next centre.\n\nIn _chakra_ meditation, yogis have experienced different \"sounds\". In the _Gerandha Samhita_ , the seven main yoga practices were given to enable the student to hear the \"inner sounds\". Mudra is one of seven practices that yogis employ in order to aid the hearing of these inner sounds.\n\nIn _Yoni Mudra_ yogis not only visualise each one of the _chakras_ , but also listen intently to inner sounds or what is popularly called \"the mystic sounds\". The yoga texts say that if you are right-handed, you will hear these sounds in your right ear and if you are left-handed, you will hear these sounds in your left ear.\n\nAnother Mudra practice that the yoga texts also recommend for the hearing of the inner sounds is _Sambhavi Mudra_. Like _Yoni Mudra_ , it is also more of a spiritual practice than a physical exercise. Yoga texts mention that you should sit in _siddhasana_ , and close your ears with the thumbs (as in the _Yoni Mudra)_. Although the eyes are kept open in _Sambhavi Mudra_ , the practitioner is supposed to \"look without wanting to see anything\". The eyes remain open, but the attention is within. The practice is a 'seal' in that consciousness is prevented from externalising which, in turn, prevents the arousal of objects from within itself. When all externalisation ceases, there is the experience of great inner joy. This is the reason that some yogis, including the Tibetans, call Mudra the \"fountain of joy\".\n\nSince these Mudras are intended for use in _chakra_ meditation, it is recommended that they not be combined with other types of meditation. That will compromise their effectiveness. For the committed student or practitioner, there are numerous purificatory practices, numerous _pranayama_ practices, numerous _asanas_ , numerous Mudras, all providing varied opportunities for meditation and self-discovery.\n\nWe have skimmed the surface obviously considering the limitations of condensing a topic that is ancient, rich and profound in its every fold to mere words. The great masters have spent lifetimes in the discovery of Mudras, and with every passing day a little more is added to the vast repertoire of knowledge on the subject. Just imagine: a seemingly innocuous gesture of the fingers, a little prayer, a touch of visualisation and pronto you are transported to a new consciousness. The more one delves into the subject, the less one knows. And learning all about it will take as much time as it took for creation to manifest itself in all its splendour.\n\n# **Preferable Accompaniments: Music and Colour**\n\nAn environment that is conducive is a great catalyst in any meaningful activity. The right surroundings, good music, diet, colours, fragrances and so many other compatible factors usher quality moments to the seeker. These moments can be infinite and open windows of great joy and enchantment to the genuine believer. He/she will be seized with an inexplicable ecstasy that will consume his every pore.\n\nThe right music has a calming effect. Even in hospitals, music accompanies surgery these days. Its therapeutic effects, even on plants and animals, have been well documented, and its accompaniment with Mudras transports the practitioner into a state of deep relaxation.\n\nHowever, the choice of music remains personal though classical music, solo concerts, instrumental music and airy sounds have been found to be conducive to the right mood elevation necessary for the spiritual journey. Soft music abets a softer mood and hard, blaring music can move inherent aggression into fifth gear.\n\nAlong with music, colours too play an important part. There is no rule of thumb and there are no 'bad' colours and 'good' colours. The use of colours is also subjective and is dependent on personal taste, moods, imagery, the way we feel about ourselves, our personal evolution and development, and so many other factors.\n\nResearch into colours has thrown up some interesting conclusions on how they influence us. Red is supposed to improve circulation, orange helps as a mood elevator, yellow stimulates digestion, violet is the colour of transformation, brown is stable, black protects, green regenerates, blue is calming, and white contains all the colours and stands for purity.\n\nSo don't ever underestimate the power of compatible music and colour. For growth of any kind, the right ambience is vital. In the big cities of today, yoga, meditation and other self-healing techniques have staged a fashionable comeback. The stressed-out executive has realised that money and the gizmos it affords can't keep him sane or healthy. So there are retreats, conclaves, resorts, communes, even little corners in crowded homes that provide a little slice of private space for the soul seeker.\n\nAlternate therapies, self-healing, various types of realisations and actualisations are falling over each other in a hurry as the human experience has not only magnified but also been blister packed into a tiny time capsule. Every generation gets smarter, and burnout is early. So all forms of healing have been culled out of the past with a vengeance as the neo-man in the Aquarian Age is hooking up to _Nirvana_ faster than his coffee turning black.\n\n# **The Meaning of \"Namaste\"**\n\nThe gesture of _Namaste_ is essentially Indian and therefore ancient. It is an integral part of Indian culture; its verv essence is encapsulated in the hold of both palms held erect together in front of the bosom in greeting. It is used always, is not dependent on occasion, and is quintessentially Indian. In that simple gesture lies the timelessness of India, the mother culture of the world. If any one gesture were to be recognised as representative of Brand India, there is no doubt it is the simple, humble and overpoweringly significant _Namaste_. It is also one of our largest exports.\n\nAtmanjali Mudra\n\n_Namaste_ represents the belief that there is a Divine spark within each of us that is located in the heart _chakra_. The gesture is an acknowledgment of the soul in one by the soul in another. In a literal translation, _\"Nama\"_ means _how, \"as\"_ means _I_ , and _\"te\"_ means _you_. Therefore, _Namaste_ means, \"bow me you\" or \"I bow to you\".\n\nTo perform _Namaste_ , we place the hands together at the heart _chakra_ , close the eyes, and bow the head. It can also be done by placing the hands together in front of the third eye, bowing the head, and then bringing the hands down to the heart. This is an especially deep form of respect.\n\nFor a teacher and student, _Namaste_ allows two indiv\n", "final_result_str": "repair", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "91944614-b22c-40a1-9f9d-d41d96c18cee", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "正常书籍"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "31fd1b04-729d-4df0-972f-1a3d9c2a7223", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "书的章节和序言"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "7808f46f-0fa3-43c5-8606-b0c4f57d11dd", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "need_repair", "evidence": "前置内容书籍"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "0fae4d32-cc60-4649-bbad-775992516cb4", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 知识性内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

His face flushed with anger.\n\n'Hey – we're here – come on!'\n\nThe doors opened and the hen party spilled onto the underground platform, waving plastic pitchforks, spiked tails swaying, devil horns blinking red. Hanging back, he waited for the five bobbing heads to reach the escalator before he followed.\n\nThree clubs later she was drunk and needing the toilet. He was waiting on the other side of the saloon doors. She turned a glassy surprised eye on him.\n\n'What are you doing here?'\n\nHe smiled and handed her a drink.\n\n'Taking a last look before you become a married woman.'\n\nShe believed him. They chinked bottles.\n\n'To a long and happy marriage.'\n\nShe met his smile. 'To a long and happy marriage.'\n\nHe watched her swallow three quarters of the bottle.\n\n'Wow,' she said. 'Now I do need a piss.'\n\nShe pushed open the toilet door, her knees already buckling, then fell, hard. The bottle smashed against a sink, exploding in a shower of rainbow glass.\n\nHer heels began to drum the floor; her hands clawed the air. Foamy spittle bubbled out of her lips as they turned blue. Her eyes widened in terror. She tried desperately to draw air into her lungs, her chest heaving.\n\nNow his smile was genuine. Served her right, the bitch.\n\n## CHAPTER TWO\n\nDr Rhona MacLeod looked up as the waiter sat a bottle of chilled white wine and two glasses on the table.\n\n'I didn't order ...' she began.\n\n'Compliments of the band.'\n\nIt was after midnight and the crowds were thinning. DI Bill Wilson was still there, arms locked round Margaret his wife of thirty years, swaying to the haunting sounds of the saxophone. He was enjoying the remnants of his fiftieth birthday party. The police could throw a hell of a do when required. Even Bill's boss had managed a five-minute appearance, to drink a glass of champagne, before he went off to dinner with someone more important.\n\nRhona poured herself a glass of wine. The saxophone drew to the end of its piece, sending shivers down her spine. She wasn't a jazz fan. But tonight had almost changed her mind.\n\n'Hey.' Chrissy, her forensic assistant, appeared at her side, a young man by the hand. 'We're off.' She raised an eyebrow at the wine and glasses.\n\n'From the band,' Rhona told her.\n\nChrissy ran a practised eye over the men on stage.\n\n'Hope it's the saxophone player.'\n\nIt was, but Rhona didn't say.\n\n'See you tomorrow then.'\n\nRhona smiled back. 'See you.'\n\nChrissy pranced off, dazed young constable in tow. Rhona secretly wished him luck.\n\nThe saxophonist thanked his audience in an Irish accent as though he meant it. He sat the saxophone on its stand, jumped from the stage and came towards her.\n\n'Hi.' His eyes were very blue. 'I'm Sean. Can we talk?'\n\nThey talked while the rest of the band packed up. Bill came to say goodbye. He looked happy, his arm round Margaret. Rhona was pleased he'd had a good time. Bill deserved the respect his colleagues paid him. He was a good guy and a good policeman. He complimented Sean on his performance and winked at Rhona.\n\n'Come on,' Margaret pulled him away. 'It's time I took you home, birthday boy.'\n\nThen they were alone apart from the barman, who handed Sean the keys.\n\n'You lock up. I'm off.'\n\n'I own a part share in the club,' Sean explained as the door shut and silence fell.\n\nRhona wondered how much of this was planned. How many women Sean had seduced with his blue eyes, Irish voice and saxophone. At this moment she didn't care.\n\n'There's a tune I'd like you to hear.'\n\nHe stood on stage, eyes closed, caressing the golden instrument. The sound was dark and sensual. Mood music.\n\n'That was great,' she said when he finished. 'What's it called?'\n\n' _For You_.'\n\nShe laughed at his cheeky grin. Irish charm. Who could beat it?\n\nThey walked towards her flat, side by side, not touching.\n\nBeing alone had always been her choice. She loved her work, her flat, her life. If or when men came it was good but never permanent. She wondered if she would invite him up, already knowing she would. Between them was something inevitable, although probably short-lived.\n\nThey didn't speak as they climbed the stairs. She unlocked the door and they stepped inside. He undressed her in the hallway, so slowly she wanted to scream at him to hurry. His tongue flicked her lips until she opened her mouth to him.\n\nHer mobile rang, pulling her from sleep. She reached down, searching for her handbag, suddenly remembering. Sean was stretched out beside her, easy in sleep. She checked herself for regret and found none.\n\nShe slipped out of bed and found her bag ringing in the hall.\n\n'Rhona?'\n\n'Bill.'\n\n'Sorry to wake you.'\n\n'What's wrong?'\n\n'I'm at the _Excalibur_ pub near the Arches. Female body in the toilets.'\n\n'I'll be there in fifteen minutes.'\n\nShe shook Sean awake.\n\nAs she pulled on clothes, he told her he would wait for her to come back.\n\nShe looked at him, puzzled.\n\n'I make good coffee,' he explained.\n\nShe nodded, already thinking about death.\n\nShe pulled the front door behind her, knowing he wouldn't be there when she got back. Making love to a forensic scientist might be exciting. Waiting for her to come back from a murder scene was not.\n\n_Excalibur_ had a big sword above the door. Long and hard. Frequented mainly by singles, the symbol promised more than it could deliver.\n\nBill was waiting in the corridor beyond the saloon doors. He looked at her, bleary eyed.\n\n'Happy birthday,' she said.\n\nHe pointed her towards the toilets.\n\nThe twisted body was sprawled half in, half out of a cubicle, devil horns blinking red. She wore black lycra, stretched over full breasts. A forked tail lay motionless on the tiles among the broken glass of an alcopop bottle.\n\n'A hen night,' Bill said. 'Her mate found her. They called 999. The paramedic that tried mouth to mouth reported a strange tingling in his lips. He called us.'\n\nRhona ran a latex-gloved finger over the blue lips then touched her own. The spot she touched tingled then went numb. She picked up a piece of glass and sniffed it.\n\n'What's up?' Bill said.\n\n'Not sure. Could be poison.'\n\nBill looked surprised. 'I thought it was drugs.'\n\nRhona took a sample of the small sticky pool of browny-purple liquid.\n\n'I'll collect the glass. If she was poisoned, the bottle was the murder weapon.'\n\nRhona cleared the face of hair and caught a faint scent of something other than booze and makeup.\n\n'Did she have asthma?'\n\n'Her mates are next door. We'll ask.'\n\nFour devils sat side by side, smeared mascara, eyes clouded by drink. Three seemed unable to speak. Rhona spoke to the fourth, who said her name was Tracey.\n\n'We were pissed,' she muttered. 'Donna went to the toilet and never came back. I went looking for her. She was jerking and moaning. It was horrible. I got scared and called 999 on my mobile.' She looked at Rhona. 'She's dead, isn't she?'\n\nRhona nodded.\n\n'We drank the same amount. How come she's dead?' Tears ran black down her cheeks. 'She was getting married tomorrow.'\n\n'We'll need to inform her family.'\n\n'She didn't have one. Only her mates... and Jonny.'\n\n'Jonny?' Rhona said.\n\n'Her fiance.' She spat out the word.\n\n'You didn't like him?' Bill said.\n\nTracey was defiant. 'He wanted Donna to change. I liked her the way she was.'\n\n'Did Donna take her drink to the toilet with her?' Rhona asked.\n\nTracey looked puzzled. 'Why would she do that?'\n\n'Was she asthmatic?'\n\n'What?'\n\n'Did she have asthma?'\n\n'Not that I know of.'\n\n'Are any of you asthmatic?'\n\nThey shook their heads.\n\n'Fucked up, yes,' Tracey said. 'Asthmatic no.'\n\nRhona opened her forensic bag and set about taking samples. The girl's body was already showing signs of rigor mortis. The muscle stiffening and the macabre grin suggested poison, probably strychnine. But finding the cause of death was the pathologist's job. Hers was to find traces of the attacker.\n\nThere was no evidence of violent or sexual assault, apart from grazed skin from the broken bottle. Rhona sampled the lips and bagged the gloved hands. Then she set about picking up the glass.\n\nThe pathologist arrived as she was finishing. Dr Sissons gave her a weary look.\n\n'Drugs or drink?'\n\nRhona shook her head. 'At a guess, strychnine poisoning.'\n\nNow she had his interest. Poisonings were not the usual manner of violent death in Glasgow on a Friday night.\n\nWhen Rhona got back to the flat, dawn was streaking the sky with red. Her cat, Chance, ran towards her, looking for food. She smelt coffee, then heard Sean humming. Naked, he smiled as she entered the kitchen.\n\n'Okay?'\n\nShe nodded, unsure whether she wanted him there or not.\n\nHe tipped a measure of whisky in the coffee and carried it into the bedroom.\n\n'Want to talk?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'Good.'\n\nWhen he moved against her she forgot the blue lips and twisted limbs. She forgot death and celebrated life.\n\n## CHAPTER THREE\n\nBill was seated in his favourite chair. It looked out of place in the modern office. Old leather, with a girn that could not be oiled into silence, it gave him a place to think.\n\n'Poison,' he shook his head. 'It's like an Agatha Christie novel.'\n\n'Strychnine. She died quickly, if horribly.'\n\n'Jonny, the fiance, is a fireman.'\n\n'A suspect?'\n\n'How many husbands-to-be kill their bride on her hen night?'\n\n'We've had weirder murders.'\n\nBill shook his head. The world of murder was as strange as it had been when he started in the force thirty years before.\n\nDetective Constable Janice Clarke stuck her head round the door.\n\n'Car's here, sir.'\n\n'Ready?'\n\nRhona nodded.\n\nDonna Steven's flat was in a block on the lower end of Maryhill Road, minutes from Charing Cross. Bill left the driver with the car to safeguard his tyres.\n\nA team was already there. Three white suits greeted Rhona as she entered from the walkway.\n\nThe flat was tiny. A kitchen-living room, a bedroom, cramped hall and bathroom. In the bedroom an ivory wedding dress hung on a wardrobe door. On the dressing table sat a fairytale veil. Rhona fingered the dress material, recognising the smooth feel of expensive silk.\n\nShe tried to imagine what Donna had been thinking and feeling the last time she was in this room.\n\n'Civil wedding. A small guest list but no expense spared,' Bill told her.\n\n'What did she do for a living?'\n\n'Worked in a newsagent, Tracey says'.\n\nRhona glanced again at the wedding frock. 'If she didn't have a family...'\n\n'I take it the dress is expensive?'\n\n'Silk. A couple of thousand I would say.'\n\n'Bloody hell!'\n\nBill had a teenage daughter and a son. Chances were he would be counting the cost shortly himself.\n\n'So where was the money coming from?' Bill said.\n\n'The husband-to-be?'\n\n'The guy's in shock. I'll interview him later.'\n\n'Can I take a look at the room... by myself?'\n\nBill nodded. 'Be my guest.'\n\nRhona's mentor in the early days had been Dr Fields, or Eagle-eye as he was fondly known. He did everything. Medical, fibres, fingerprints, all the branches. He taught her how to get results from what was called reticent evidence. Evidence not willing to give up its secrets. One thing more he'd taught her. Forensics can help, but only if you know what to look for. To know that, you have to get to know the victim.\n\nThe wedding dress dominated the room. Below it was a pair of matching silk shoes. A wave of emotion swept over Rhona. Donna wanted to get married. Did someone poison her to stop that happening?\n\nBeside the shoes sat a small wastepaper basket. Below a couple of makeup tissues was a single red rose, wilting from lack of water.\n\nRhona carefully removed it and slipped it in a forensic bag.\n\nFifteen minutes later Bill was at the door. 'Find anything?'\n\n'Small spots of blood on the bed cover. And some hair samples from the pillow that don't look like Donna's.'\n\nShe showed him the rose. 'And this.'\n\nBill sniffed. 'Shop roses don't usually have a scent.'\n\n'Is Jonny a gardener?'\n\n'He lives in a flat above the fire station. Anyway, garden roses don't flower in November, do they?'\n\nBill dropped her off at the forensic lab, promising to get in touch after he'd interviewed Jonny Simpson.\n\nRhona loved the view from her laboratory window, even now in November. She looked down on Kelvingrove Park, the Art Gallery and Museum in the distance. The museum had been her favourite haunt both as a child with her father and later as a student studying at Glasgow University.\n\nChrissy appeared from the back lab and gave Rhona a look.\n\n'What?' Rhona played the innocent.\n\n'Was it the saxophonist?'\n\nRhona laughed.\n\n'I knew it. And?'\n\n'And what?' said Rhona, putting on her lab coat.\n\nChrissy pulled a face. 'You're not going to tell me, are you?'\n\nRhona shook her head.\n\n'Must have been good.'\n\n'Chrissy,' Rhona warned.\n\n'Okay, okay.' Chrissy took the hint.\n\nRhona began unpacking her forensic bag.\n\n'The bride in the toilet?'\n\n'I went to her flat with Bill. There was a very expensive wedding dress hanging in the bedroom...'\n\n'Poor cow... '\n\n'And this...'\n\nRhona showed Chrissy the rose.\n\n'Maybe she had another admirer. One that Jonny didn't know about,' Chrissy suggested.\n\n'Or one he found out about...'\n\n## CHAPTER FOUR\n\nJonny Simpson sat with his head in his hands.\n\nDI Wilson had seen all kinds of grief in thirty years as a policeman. It always left its mark. And you had to be careful. Genuine grief didn't always look the way you thought it should.\n\n'Okay Mr Simpson. Tell me about the last time you saw Donna.'\n\nJonny lifted a white face.\n\n'I haven't seen Donna since Wednesday night. I've been on call.'\n\n'Did you speak to her?'\n\n'We sent texts.'\n\n'And what did she say in these texts?'\n\nJonny's face flushed. 'Just private stuff.'\n\nBill was familiar with the world of text messaging, due to his two teenage children. Text was like email. You could write things you might not say.\n\n'Tracey says Donna didn't have a family.'\n\nJonny's face clouded over. 'Donna was brought up in a children's home. She only had me.'\n\n'Where did you two meet?'\n\nJonny hesitated for a second or two. 'In the newsagent where she works. I get my paper there.'\n\n'Getting married is an expensive business,' Bill said.\n\nJonny glared at him. 'If you mean the dress, Donna's been saving for it since she was sixteen. I don't care about all that, but it was important to her.'\n\nBill decided to get to the point.\n\n'Did you give Donna a rose?'\n\n'What?'\n\n'We found a red rose in the wastepaper bin in her bedroom.'\n\nJonny tried to mask the quick look of jealousy that flashed across his face.\n\n'I don't remember.'\n\n'Try.'\n\n'These folk come round the pubs, trying to sell you a rose. Donna was soft. She made me buy them sometimes.'\n\nIt was a good answer. Bill almost believed him.\n\n'Why are you talking to me anyway? Why aren't you out there catching the bastard that killed Donna?'\n\n'We'd like you to provide a DNA sample, Mr Simpson.'\n\n'You think I killed her?'\n\n'We need to eliminate you from our enquiry.'\n\nJonny took a look at Bill's calm face and relaxed.\n\n'I'll do whatever it takes to catch him.'\n\n'Donna had an admirer,' Bill told Rhona later. 'Or Jonny suspects she did.'\n\n'Someone who might give her a rose?'\n\n'Remember the murderer we got because he shared an orange with his victim?'\n\n'Just what I was thinking,' Rhona said. 'The drops of blood on the coverlet weren't Donna's.'\n\n'What about Jonny?'\n\n'We're checking. We've also identified three types of head hair from the pillow. One is Donna's. The other two are likely to be men. We have roots so a DNA analysis is possible. We'll check them against Jonny. Chrissy's taking a look at the sheets for semen.'\n\n'You think Donna was playing away?'\n\n'Could be. And there were traces of salbutomal on her hair.'\n\n'So someone asthmatic was close to her before she died?'\n\nRhona considered this. It wasn't uncommon for rapists to take a shot of an inhaler before making their move on a victim. They were so worked up that an asthma attack could be on the cards.\n\n'There was no evidence of sexual assault,' Bill reminded her.\n\n'Maybe watching Donna die was thrill enough.'\n\nA smiling Chrissy left the lab at six to meet PC Williams, the young constable she had met the evening before. Rhona stayed on to work on the Bacardi Coke bottle. On arrival that morning, she'd filled an empty bottle with a mixture of plaster of Paris, stuck a thin wooden rod down the neck and set it to harden.\n\nNow, using the rod as a handle, she took a small hammer and gently tapped the side of the bottle until it cracked in several places. Then she held it over the waste bin and gave the bottle three short sharp knocks. The glass fell away in dozens of shards.\n\nNow she had a plastic replica of the bottle, she could start putting the murder weapon together again. Chrissy had laughed when Rhona produced the Bacardi Coke bottle that morning. She laughed even harder when she heard Rhona's plan.\n\n'No chance,' had been Chrissy's expert opinion.\n\nRhona suspected Chrissy was right, but she had to give it a try.\n\nShe arranged all the pieces she'd picked up on a tray. She would start the long slow process of fitting the jigsaw together tomorrow.\n\nOutside, Rhona shivered in the raw night air. She hadn't brought the car. She could have tried for a taxi but decided to walk. Walking helped her think.\n\nStreet lights threw pools of yellow on grey puddles. The rain had dwindled to a faint mist that masked sound. Cars swished past throwing water in her path. Rhona strode on too absorbed to notice. In her head she was replaying the scene that had ended in Donna's death.\n\nDonna had been given a Bacardi Coke outside the ladies toilet. There were no signs of force so Donna took the drink willingly. But that didn't mean she knew her murderer. Rhona hoped she did. If they were dealing with a psycho who had no link with the victim, it would be even more difficult to find him.\n\nBill had questioned Donna's mates. They insisted Donna was seeing no one but Jonny. They also said they had seen nobody they knew on the night of the hen party. Only Tracey seemed wary. Wary and scared, according to Bill.\n\n## CHAPTER FIVE\n\n'Where the fuck is she?'\n\nTracey couldn't tell him the truth. 'She's not well.'\n\nBelcher's fat sweaty face grew redder.\n\n'Tell her she's fired if she doesn't turn up tomorrow night.'\n\nHe shoved a rose at Tracey. 'You do it. Room five and make it good.'\n\nThe green baize walls and heavily carpeted hallway smothered all sound. Tracey passed four doors and stood outside number five, waiting for the double vodka to swim through her blood stream.\n\nThere were four of them. Spiked hair, designer stubble, muscled bodies under patterned short-sleeved shirts. A stag night maybe? Or just guys who liked getting off on girls like her.\n\n'Hi Rose. Come on in.'\n\nThey were seated round a circular table, three champagne bottles in the middle. One of them handed her a full glass and watched her drink it in a oner.\n\nThe music came on. She started on the blonde one with the pale eyes because he looked harmless. She unbuttoned his shirt and with the rose in her mouth traced his smooth chest, lower and lower until she reached his hardening crotch.\n\nThe others yelled in delight.\n\nJonny came in at midnight and took a seat at the bar. Tracey had finished her stint with the four guys and badly needed a drink. She didn't see Jonny until it was too late.\n\nHe grabbed her arm and forced her onto the stool beside him. His face was a mask of hate.\n\n'She was still doing this, wasn't she? That's how she was paying for the fucking dress.'\n\nTracey didn't answer.\n\n'It's your fault she's dead. You and the rest of her fucking friends.'\n\nHe was right. She had told Donna to stay on at the club. The money was good. She could buy the dress she wanted. She'd persuaded Donna that what Jonny didn't know couldn't hurt him.\n\n'Some bastard gave her a rose. I want to know who it was.'\n\nTracey recoiled as though she'd been punched.\n\n'What?'\n\n'The police found a red rose at the flat. They think I gave it to her, but I didn't, did I, Tracey?'\n\nTracey couldn't speak. She was thinking about the dance she'd just performed. Rose's dance.\n\nWhen Jonny left, she headed for the toilet. She reached the cubicle just in time. A mix of vodka and champagne hit the pan. She pressed her face against the cool toilet seat, her body shaking.\n\nJonny had made her promise not to tell the police about Donna's job here and the guy who kept coming back again and again to see her dance as Rose. He also made her promise to carry on doing what Belcher wanted.\n\n'They said you're good,' Belcher had told her when she'd finished with the four guys. 'Very satisfying.' He said the words like he had a hard-on himself. 'You're the new Rose.' He poked a fat finger in her face. 'And you can tell Donna that from me.'\n\nShe wanted to shout at him. 'Donna's dead you stupid bastard. She's dead!'\n\nBut she had said nothing, her stomach tight with fear.\n\n'The sicko will come back,' Jonny's eyes had glinted revenge as he left. 'He'll be looking for another Rose. And I'll be waiting for him.'\n\n## CHAPTER SIX\n\nMrs Harper opened her front door as Rhona came up the stairs. In her arms were a dozen red roses.\n\n'These were delivered this afternoon,' she told Rhona with a wide smile.\n\nHer neighbour had set her sights on seeing Rhona 'settled down' as she put it, and took a keen interest in her love life... when there was any.\n\nRhona waited until she was inside the flat before she looked at the card. It simply said 'For you'.\n\nThe rush of pleasure the words brought surprised her. She hadn't thought about Sean all day. She never mixed work and pleasure.\n\nWhile the bath filled, she fed Chance and poured herself a glass of wine. Her kitchen window looked down on the gardens of a convent. In daylight it offered a tranquil scene. At night, soft light lit up a statue of the Virgin Mary that stood in the centre of the lawn.\n\nThe tolling of the convent bell for prayers was part of her life. Rhona loved its certainty, although for her there was no certainty in life, except death.\n\nShe slipped low in the water, enjoying the heat on her skin. Sex with Sean had been good. Better than good. Thinking about it now brought a second rush of pleasure.\n\nThe question was, did she want to get involved? Great sex was one thing. A proper relationship was another.\n\nThe buzzer went at midnight. Rhona knew it was Sean before she answered.\n\nWhen she let him in, he stood uncertain in the hall.\n\n'I woke you,' he said taking in the dressing gown.\n\n'No,' she answered. 'I was reading.'\n\nShe was greedy for him but still she didn't move.\n\n'Rhona...'\n\nThen she was in his arms, her mouth on his. Her body screaming for him.\n\nLater they lay in the dark, his heart beating gently against her cheek.\n\n'We're good at this.' His voice was light.\n\nHe was like her, she thought. Alone but not lonely. Self-contained. Maybe it would work?\n\n'We could give it a try?' He echoed her own thoughts.\n\nRhona touched his nipple and felt it harden.\n\n## CHAPTER SEVEN\n\nBill Wilson had interviewed the girlfriends again and got nowhere. They were adamant they had seen no-one they recognised on the hen night. Only when he asked them how they knew Donna, did they stumble. The stories they told him didn't ring true. Especially Tracey's.\n\nShe sat in front of him now, her eyes bloodshot, her brow slick with sweat. She was nursing a hangover or dealing with a drug habit or she was shit scared. Bill suspected the latter.\n\n'There's something you're not telling me, Tracey.' He hated seeing the lassie in this state and it sounded in his voice.\n\nShe didn't look at him, her hands plucking at the denim mini skirt. But he sensed her weakening.\n\n'We met at work... at a club called... _Eden_.'\n\nHe'd heard of it. He waited for her to go on.\n\n'Lap-dancing. Donna performed as Rose.'\n\n'Performed?'\n\n'She used a rose in the routine.'\n\nHe didn't ask her to explain the routine. He had a pretty good idea already.\n\n'There was a guy. Came almost every night for weeks.'\n\n'You saw him?'\n\n'No. Rose... Donna told me about him though.'\n\n'What did she tell you?\n\n'He always brought his own rose. Made her dig the thorns into him.'\n\nBill felt the surge of excitement that came with the first breakthrough. Rhona had been right. The rose was important. Maybe even a direct link with the murderer.\n\n'Did Donna say what he looked like?'\n\nShe shook her head. 'He was young. Worked out. That's all.'\n\n'Thank you Tracey.'\n\nShe met his eyes. Hers were tearful. He thought of his own teenage daughter, as safe as he could keep her. It made Bill want to weep too. Mr Belcher wasn't impressed to see Rhona and DI Wilson enter his club. He was even less impressed when they said they wanted to forensically examine the private room Rose danced in.\n\n'Rose is gone. I sacked her.'\n\n'Rose's real name was Donna Stevens,' Bill told him. 'And Donna is dead, Mr Belcher. She was murdered.'\n\nBelcher's face was a mix of emotions and sympathy wasn't one of them.\n\n'What has that got to do with my club?'\n\n'We think her murderer met her here.'\n\nBelcher gave Bill a sharp look. 'You don't know that...'\n\n'We have trace material,' Rhona interrupted. 'If we find a match in the room...'\n\n'I won't have my club involved in this.'\n\nBill ignored the bluster. 'I want a list of all your regulars and their contact details.'\n\nBelcher was growing paler by the minute. 'Our customers are mostly casual.'\n\nHe was lying. It was written in big letters across his face. Rhona suspected there would be names on that list that didn't want to see the light of day. Bill didn't care.\n\n'And include a list of all credit card payments.'\n\nBelcher showed them to room five, then scuttled off to call his lawyer.\n\n'I'll manage here,' Rhona told Bill.\n\n'You're sure?'\n\n'Give me an hour.'\n\nThe room was too warm and smelt of perfume and stale cigarette smoke. It didn't look clean either, which suited Rhona fine. She locked the door and went on to sample every inch of the hideous green carpet.\n\nThe roses for the performance were usually supplied by the management. But one customer brought his own. A crushed petal from that rose could be a link to Donna's flat.\n\n## CHAPTER EIGHT\n\nShe needed the money. That's what Tracey kept reminding herself. She had told the police. She'd done all she could.\n\nBelcher had insisted she use Donna's area of the dressing room as though it was a move up in the world. In the mirror her face was a mask of glossed lips and blackened eyes. Tracey rubbed the rose-scented oil into her skin and put on the red thong and bra.\n\nRoom seven had become the Rose room for tonight, Belcher told her. He did not explain why. Her first customer was waiting.\n\nIt was the blonde guy from the foursome. He looked sheepish, scared even. She remembered his embarrassment. His cock had shrivelled when she'd unzipped him.\n\n'I wanted to apologise for my mates,' he began.\n\n'You could have done that without paying.'\n\nHis eyes ran over her, fastening on her breasts.\n\n'If you just like looking...'\n\nHe nodded.\n\nShe reached round and unhooked the bra. Her breasts fell, oiled and heavy.\n\nTwo glasses of chilled champagne stood on the table. He handed her one. She touched her nipple and made it harden, watching his reaction. At least he only wanted to look.\n\nThe heavily carpeted corridor was deserted but Rhona sensed people behind the row of closed doors.\n\nBelcher came hurrying over as she re-entered the bar. His attempt at a smile made him look like a gargoyle in the purple light. His lawyer must have told him to co-operate ... up to a point.\n\n'You've finished? Good.'\n\n'Is Tracey here?'\n\nThe smile disappeared. He made a show of checking the reservation book.\n\n'I'm afraid Tracey's dancing at the moment.'\n\nRhona took a seat at the bar.\n\n'I'll wait.'\n\nHis eyes darted about. He was working out whether that would put the punters off.\n\n'If you'd like to wait in my office?'\n\n'Here's fine.'\n\nBelcher gave up and nodded at the barman who slid the drinks list across the counter. Rhona glanced at the prices. It wasn't only private dance routines that cost the earth in here.\n\nThe smile was pasted back on Belcher's face.\n\n'On the house of course.'\n\nRhona ordered a mineral water and took a good look round. The clients were all male except for herself and a girl wrapped round a pole. Rhona recognised the girl as one of the devils from the hen party. Her eyes were glazed, her movements were fluid. The pole was holding her up.\n\nYoung men circled the stage, faces eager and aroused. Round the walls the men who didn't fancy being seen were in dark booths. Now and again Belcher appeared and led a group through the green door for their private session.\n\nBy the time Bill came back, Rhona had been chatted up twice. Once by a guy old enough to be her father. The second time by a guy young enough to be her son. She was glad to see Bill.\n\n'How'd it go?' he said.\n\n'Fine. I asked to speak to Tracey.'\n\n'And?'\n\n'She's dancing.'\n\nBelcher was showing in the next group. Bill stepped in front of him.\n\n'Get Tracey in here now.'\n\nBelcher's mouth opened and shut a few times.\n\n'I'll send her out.'\n\nWhen he re-appeared he was alone, an irritated look on his face.\n\n'Tracey's gone.'\n\n'If this is a wind up...'\n\nBelcher shook his head. 'She was in seven, the Rose room for tonight. With a single guy. The room's empty and she's not in the dressing area.'\n\nRhona pushed past him, a sick feeling in her stomach.\n\nThe door to seven stood open. An oily scent of roses hit her at the entrance. That and the musky smell of sex.\n\n## CHAPTER NINE\n\nOne girl dead and another girl missing. Rhona didn't want to think that something bad had happened to Tracey.\n\nIf she was as scared as Tracey, she would probably run. Which is what she hoped Tracey had done.\n\nBill extracted Tracey's address from the pole dancer and they drove round there. Neither of them expected to find Tracey at home.\n\nThe basement bedsit, complete with barred windows, was near the Kelvin Hall. The door was opened by a short balding man in his fifties. He took a long look at Bill's ID card before he let them in.\n\nTracey had gone out a couple of hours ago, he told them. She hadn't come back. Rhona didn't like the man, but thought he was probably telling the truth.\n\nTracey's room was untidy and smelt musty. The wardrobe and drawers were stacked with clothes. If Tracey had run, she hadn't taken much with her.\n\nBill went out to the car to call the station while Rhona took a closer look.\n\nA half-empty bottle of vodka sat on the dressing table beside the picture of a small boy of about three on a swing. He was so like Tracey, he had to be her son. The child obviously didn't live here. Could Tracey have gone to wherever he was?\n\nRhona heard Bill in the hall.\n\n'I've put out a call on Tracey.'\n\nRhona handed him the photo.\n\n'Tracey had a kid?'\n\n'Looks like it. I think you should ask for a forensic team to go over this room too.'\n\n'Tricky. This isn't even a missing person case yet.'\n\n'Okay. I'll do it myself, unofficially for the moment.' She didn't add until we find a body. By the look on Bill's face, he was thinking the same thing.\n\nIt was dark as they drove back to the lab. Bill's wife called him on the way, reminding him to come home and eat. For a moment, Rhona wished someone was waiting at home for her.\n\nThe lab was deserted. Everyone including Chrissy had left. Rhona set to work, enjoying the silence.\n\nThe pathologist had confirmed strychnine had been used to kill Donna. The large dose she was given killed her quickly, probably because of a weak heart. Otherwise Donna's agony might have lasted even longer.\n\nA rose expert had promised to get back to Rhona on the breed of rose found in Donna's flat. Something special could prove easier to track down.\n\nAn hour later she had what she was looking for. Minute traces of blood on three of the rose's thorns. If the guy who liked his sex rough was Donna's murderer, they had his blueprint.\n\n## CHAPTER TEN\n\nJonny Simpson wasn't due back at work for a week. His honeymoon week, the supervisor reminded Bill.\n\nBill thanked him and put the phone down.\n\nTracey's feelings about Jonny Simpson had never been fully explained. And now Bill couldn't ask her. Nine times out of ten the murderer was someone the victim knew. Men regularly killed their wives and their girlfriends. Jonny had lied about the rose. He was jealous of someone or something.\n\nAs far as Bill was concerned there were two men in the frame for the murder. Jonny and the mystery guy who visited Donna regularly at the club.\n\nRhona had a DNA sample from blood on the rose. It would prove whether Jonny had handled the rose but it wouldn't prove he killed Donna.\n\nBill didn't like to think about the third scenario. That the murderer had chosen Donna at random. With no other motive than the desire to kill.\n\nJonny's room above the fire station was empty. His mates hadn't seen him since the news about Donna. His best man, Alistair Banks, also a fireman, had no idea where Jonny was.\n\n'He said he needed to get away for a couple of days. Sort his head out. He was devastated about Donna.'\n\n'Did Jonny say anything about Donna seeing someone else?'\n\nBanks looked genuinely surprised.\n\n'No way. You should have seen them together. Donna loved him.'\n\n'And Jonny?'\n\n'Donna was Jonny's girl. He wouldn't have let... '\n\nBill waited.\n\n'It wouldn't have happened.'\n\n'Donna had a regular spot at the _Eden_ club as a lap dancer.' Bill watched the face closely. 'Did Jonny know that?'\n\nA lot of emotions played on Banks' face. Then he decided to come clean.\n\n'Jonny met Donna there. We went in a crowd from the fire station. When they started a relationship, Donna stopped dancing. That's what he told me.'\n\n'Jonny believed she'd stopped?'\n\nBanks nodded.\n\nBut Donna hadn't stopped dancing. Was that enough reason for Jonny to kill her? Bill winced at the thought. But he couldn't ignore the fact that Jonny and Tracey had disappeared at about the same time. And that conjured up all sorts of ideas. Most of them bad.\n\nHad Jonny killed his bride-to-be in a fit of rage and Tracey suspected him? If so, Jonny would have to remove Tracey to stop her talking.\n\nBill had been a policeman for a long time. Some said he had too soft a heart to become a Chief Inspector. He didn't sook up to the right people. He fell out with his superiors too often. He was a free spirit. A loose cannon. Bill didn't care what they said about him. All he cared about was finding out the truth. That's why he and Rhona got along. She was a scientist. But she had a heart. A big one, though she tried not to show it too often. Rhona took every case to heart. Every death. The only way she could help the victim was to solve the case. She was determined about that. It took up all her time and denied her a personal life. Bill wondered for a moment about the saxophone player she'd met at his birthday party. Had it lasted? He secretly wanted Dr Rhona MacLeod to have what he had. Someone to love her. A life outside murder and mayhem. A family.\n\nA family is what neither Donna nor the missing Tracey seemed to have, despite the fact that Tracey was a mother.\n\nDC Clarke had come up with details of Tracey's child. The boy was three. He had been born when Tracey was fifteen. Tracey had refused to have him adopted and he was now in long-term fostering. If she had a photo of the boy, it was likely she was in touch with the foster family. DC Clarke was checking their address with the social work department.\n\nBy seven o'clock Rhona had the name of the rose. He could hear her excitement over the phone.\n\n'A new rose. Came on the market summer 2004. Bred from a fragrant garden rose and a cut rose for vase display. Lasts well and smells nice.'\n\n'Well done,' he said and meant it.\n\n'I had help.'\n\n'So where does that get us?'\n\n'The roses are only sold by Marks and Spencer.'\n\n'He didn't grow it?'\n\n'Which explains why it was blooming in November.'\n\nBill's heart sank. How many people bought roses from Marks and Spencer?\n\nRhona came in. 'Try the nearest outlets to the club and Donna's flat. If the guy was in the habit of buying them, the shop might remember him.'\n\n'We'll give it a go.'\n\n'No sign of Tracey?'\n\nBill grunted. 'No. And Jonny's disappeared now too.'\n\n## CHAPTER ELEVEN\n\nRhona went past the jazz club on her way home.\n\nOutside, she read and re-read the advert for the weekly jazz sessions Sean played in, refusing to admit that his name on the billboard was important to her.\n\nIt was dark inside. She stumbled down the stairs following the sound of his saxophone. He was practising and his quiet notes matched the beat of her heart.\n\nThe same guy was behind the bar, stacking. When he saw her, he melted into the background.\n\nSean stood alone on stage, lit by a single light, his eyes closed. He was improvising _For You_. He played the tune through simply, then each note took on a partner, became a trio, then a complex variation.\n\nSean caught sight of her and stopped.\n\nRhona thought for a moment she had made a mistake. Was she wrong about the situation between them? She hated the effect the thought had on her. Then his face lit up.\n\n'Rhona.'\n\n'I was passing,' she lied.\n\n'I'm glad.'\n\nThe barman brought coffee. They sat in the shadow of a booth, opposite one another, and drank it. Sean appeared calm. Rhona was nervous, a feeling she didn't like.\n\nHe broke the silence. 'I'm playing tonight. Will you come?'\n\n'I'm not a big jazz fan.'\n\nHe was three feet from her, yet she could smell the scent of his skin.\n\n'It takes time to appreciate jazz.'\n\nThey were talking but the words meant nothing. Only the physical closeness of their bodies.\n\n'I don't start here for a couple of hours. Have you eaten?'\n\nHe took her silence as a no and stood up.\n\n'Let's go,' he said.\n\nBill phoned in the middle of the meal. Rhona knew by his voice it was something bad.\n\n'Tracey?'\n\n'The council came to remove a skip from a back alley close to _Eden_. Tracey's body was inside. It looks much like the last one.'\n\nRhona swore under her breath.\n\nSean was silent, watching her face.\n\n'I'm on my way.'\n\nShe flicked the mobile shut.\n\n'I have to go. When do you finish at the jazz club?'\n\n'Midnight,' he said. 'I'll come round.' It wasn't a question.\n\nRhona didn't argue because it was what she wanted too.\n\nThe twisted body had been removed from the skip and laid in the incident tent. Tracey was almost unrecognisable. Broken masonry sliding down a shute from the roof had beaten and bloodied her. But the typical grin of the strychnine victim was there.\n\nA wave of emotion hit Rhona. Twenty-four hours ago Tracey had been alive. They had known she was scared of something or someone, and they hadn't saved her from this horrible death.\n\nBill Wilson looked the way she felt.\n\n'Did no one look in the skip before they dropped the stuff down the shute?' Rhona asked in disbelief.\n\n'She was under rubbish. They didn't see her.'\n\n'How the hell did he get her in there?'\n\nIf Tracey was alive at the time, her limbs would have been jerking all over the place. If she was dead, she would have been a dead weight.\n\n'Maybe he had help?'\n\nBill was right. There could be more than one of them.\n\n'Someone could be helping him clear up the mess,' she said. 'Someone who has a lot to lose if we find the murderer.'\n\n'I've got a list of _Eden_ 's regular customers from Belcher. DC Clarke's going through them now.'\n\n'The important clients won't be on that list.'\n\nBill made a growling noise in his throat. 'Then I'll find a way to shut the place down.'\n\nWhen Bill left the tent, Rhona stepped into her white suit. She slipped on the mask and gloves and began her forensic examination of Tracey's body.\n\n## CHAPTER TWELVE\n\nThey picked up Jonny Simpson at eleven o'clock. He had turned up at Tracey's flat, shouting the odds. The landlord didn't like his attitude and called the police.\n\nJonny looked rough. Stubble and sleepless eyes. The haunted look could be fear he was about to be charged... or sheer misery. Bill wasn't sure which. Too many roads led to Jonny, especially now the barman at _Eden_ had told them he had been in there threatening Tracey the night before she died.\n\nBill nodded at DC Clarke to start the tape rolling. He said the necessary details into the mike then turned to Jonny.\n\n'Why did you want to speak to Tracey?'\n\nJonny looked up defiantly, but said nothing.\n\n'A barman at _Eden_ reported that you were seen threatening her.'\n\nJonny's expression didn't change. 'Fuck off.'\n\n'I repeat. Did you threaten Tracey Nickell?'\n\nJonny examined his hands.\n\nBill pushed a set of crime scene photos across the desk. He hadn't told Jonny that Tracey was dead... yet. He wanted to see his reaction when he found out (if he didn't know already).\n\nJonny concentrated on his hands. They were grimy. Bill wondered if he'd been sleeping rough since Donna's death.\n\nHuman psychology said that Jonny would look at the photos eventually. He wouldn't be able to help himself. Jonny's head was down but the eyes were swivelling.\n\nBill spread the photos apart. The mangled remains of Tracey were now clearly visible.\n\nJonny's body tensed. He turned slightly and took in the photo nearest him. He swallowed. His knuckles shone white with pressure.\n\n'Oh God.'\n\nHe covered his face with his hands, his body heaving silent sobs.\n\nBill pressed the stop button.\n\n'Get Jonny a cup of tea. Make it strong and sweet.'\n\nDC Clarke left.\n\n'You're good Jonny. I'll give you that. Proper little actor... for a soap. But I know you did that,' he stabbed the photo with his forefinger. 'You killed Donna because she was sleeping with someone else, probably for money. Then you killed Tracey because she suspected it was you.'\n\nJonny jerked his head like a child defiantly saying no.\n\nJanice came in with the tea. Bill took out a small hip flask and tipped in some whisky then pushed it in front of Jonny.\n\n'Drink!'\n\nJonny lifted the mug, his hand shaking, and gulped at the hot tea.\n\nThe words came rushing out.\n\n'I found out Donna was still working at the club, but not until after she died. I went round. I was mad at Tracey because I knew she was in on it. I made her promise to do what Belcher said. Go on acting the whore with the rose. I thought the sicko would come back and I'd get him myself.'\n\n'Then it's your fault Tracey's dead.'\n\nBeside Bill, DC Clarke made a small disapproving sound.\n\n'This isn't recording sir.'\n\n'It doesn't matter. Jonny's just leaving.'\n\nA look of surprise crossed Jonny's face.\n\n'Go home. Get some sleep,' Bill grabbed the photos and stood up. 'Be back here at eleven tomorrow morning.'\n\n'Thanks.'\n\n'See Mr Simpson out, DC Clarke.'\n\nBill watched the pair leave the room. He couldn't charge Jonny until he had some evidence that he had been at the murder scene, both murder scenes. And he had to depend on Dr MacLeod for that.\n\n## CHAPTER THIRTEEN\n\nSean wasn't going to show. Rhona tried the mobile number he'd given her but got only the message service. She was angry with herself. She should never have gone to the club. It looked like she was chasing him.\n\nIt was after one o'clock, plenty of time to get from the jazz club to here, she told herself one more time. If he arrived now she wouldn't let him in. Better than that she wouldn't be here at all.\n\nShe pulled on a short black dress and high heels and grabbed her jacket. Outside it was cold with a clear sky. She walked briskly towards the main road and waved down the first taxi that passed.\n\n'Where to, luv?'\n\n' _Eden_.'\n\n' _Eden_?' he repeated.\n\n'The lap dancing club,' she confirmed.\n\n'Okay.' The driver gave her a look that spoke volumes, but didn't argue.\n\nThe city centre was empty except for the usual prostitute on every corner. Above _Eden_ a red light blinked on and off illuminating a lap dancer.\n\n'Do you want me to wait for you?'\n\nHe obviously thought she had come here to find a wayward boyfriend or husband.\n\n'No, thanks.'\n\nRhona handed him his fare.\n\nHe slipped her a card with her change. 'In case you want a quick exit.'\n\nRhona waited until he drove off, then skirted the building and entered the back lane. The incident tent was down. The skip had been removed. A couple were fucking against the wall. The guy looked round when Rhona appeared, then went briskly on with what he was doing. The girl gave Rhona a bored look over his shoulder.\n\nThe fire doors were wedged open a foot. Rhona slipped inside. The distant sound of dance music beat like a rapid heart in the green corridor.\n\nThe women's toilet was empty except for one locked cubicle. Rhona used the mirror to paint on a face and do her hair. Looking at the result, she was satisfied Belcher wouldn't recognise her, if she kept her distance.\n\nThe main room was heaving. She pushed her way through the crowds to the bar. The barman wasn't the one from her previous visit. She arranged herself on the stool while he gave her the once over.\n\n'What can I do you for?'\n\nShe gave him a friendly smile. 'Looking for a bar job. Who do I speak to?'\n\nHe thought for a minute.\n\n'Boss is busy. Important customers,' he rubbed his fingers together to emphasise money. 'Keep an eye on the door right of the stage. That's his office.' He pushed her over a drink. 'Fat guy with a red face. Belcher's the name. And a wee warning. He likes to handle the goods before he hires.'\n\nRhona took her drink to an empty booth close to the office door. She didn't get to stay alone for long. A guy watched her slide into the seat and immediately came over.\n\n'Can I join you?'\n\nShe looked him up and down. 'I'm waiting for someone.'\n\nHis face darkened. 'Who? The invisible fucking man?'\n\nShe glanced pointedly at the closed door. 'The boss.'\n\nHe muttered something obscene under his breath and went back to join the crowd round the pole dancer.\n\nWhen Belcher emerged, he had three middle-aged men with him. Rhona recognised one face. From where she wasn't sure. Then it hit her. The guy was something to do with football.\n\nShe stared at her drink as Belcher passed. The three guys were set on a private showing. When they disappeared through the baize door, Rhona took her chance.\n\n## CHAPTER FOURTEEN\n\nOnce inside, she shut the office door and locked it.\n\nIt was a large room. In the centre stood a massive oak desk like something out of a Hollywood mafia movie. Belcher, she realised, had ideas above his station. The scent of expensive aftershave and cigar smoke hung in the air. On the left hand wall was a painting hinged back to reveal a two-foot-square screen. Something Bill hadn't found in his search of the premises.\n\nOn the screen was a clear image of a room in the green corridor. The room was lit by a flashing red light. A young woman stood open-legged above one of the three men Rhona had seen follow Belcher. There was no sound, but Rhona sensed the beat of the music the girl moved to. The girl lowered herself, pressing her crotch against the man's face. Then the image changed. Another room, another girl, another dance.\n\nRhona stood, her heart thumping. Belcher, a voyeur, watched everything from here. Which meant he probably knew who Donna's regular visitor in the 'Rose' room had been.\n\nBefore she left she tried a quick look inside the desk. Only the top drawer was unlocked. In it was an open packet of condoms and an inhaler.\n\nRhona stared, the full impact of the discovery hitting her like a sledgehammer. She had Belcher marked as a voyeur, a sleazy creep who exploited young girls. But a murderer?\n\nShe left the inhaler where it was and shut the drawer.

O seu árduo trabalho possibilitou o acordo com o Conselho em primeira leitura, facto com que a Comissão se congratula. Uma vez mais, estamos a tratar a questão das substâncias químicas e da protecção das pessoas e do ambiente face aos seus efeitos potencialmente perigosos.\nAs substâncias químicas não constituem um problema exclusivamente europeu, nem tão-pouco um monopólio europeu. Estas substâncias são produzidas, comercializadas e utilizadas em todo o mundo, e os riscos associados à sua utilização são os mesmos, seja qual for o local. Portanto, é lógico que nos tenhamos esforçado por obter um sistema mundial para descrever e rotular estes produtos perigos. A legislação que hoje vamos aprovar cria as bases para uma informação uniforme a nível mundial em matéria de ambiente, saúde e segurança relativamente aos produtos químicos potencialmente perigosos.\nA protecção da saúde e do ambiente apenas passará a ser transparente e comparável a nível mundial quando forem utilizadas normas harmonizadas de medição para determinar e rotular os perigos que os produtos químicos envolvem. Também não devemos subestimar as vantagens económicas. As empresas europeias economizarão dinheiro, pois não precisão de avaliar os procedimentos químicos perigosos aplicados nos diferentes países, de acordo com critérios diferentes e sistemas diferentes. Os utilizadores profissionais de produtos químicos e os consumidores de todo o mundo beneficiarão igualmente desta harmonização. As pessoas que utilizam produtos químicos já não terão de se familiarizar com os vários sistemas diferentes para saberem qual o nível de ameaça que um determinado produto pode representar.\nO compromisso apresentado pela relatora é equilibrado e tem em devida conta aspectos como a praticabilidade e a clareza das disposições. Embora as alterações propostas pelos co-legisladores sejam numerosas, não alteram de modo significativo os princípios subjacentes ou a estrutura básica da proposta original da Comissão. A Comissão pode, por conseguinte, aceitar estas propostas. Mesmo quando estava a preparar a proposta, a Comissão teve a preocupação de manter o actual nível de protecção da saúde humana e do meio ambiente, que já é muito elevado. Estou muito satisfeito por ver que o Parlamento e o Conselho partilham o nosso ponto de vista fundamental a este respeito. A estreita e construtiva cooperação entre o Parlamento, o Conselho e a Comissão beneficiou em grande medida o processo de negociação e, como já referi, isto significa que podemos aceitar todas as propostas de compromisso sugeridas pela senhora deputada Sartori.\nAmalia Sartori\nSenhor Presidente, Senhoras e Senhores Deputados, como já lembrei o Senhor Comissário, nos últimos meses abordámos uma e outra vez a questão da classificação, rotulagem e embalagem de substâncias e misturas químicas, um sistema mais conhecido pelo acrónimo \"GHS”, para o qual sou relatora.\nPor esta razão, em vez de discutir os pormenores técnicos do dossiê novamente, gostaria de começar por agradecer aos meus colegas e relatores-sombra com quem trabalhei numa base de grande colaboração e transparência, entabulando um diálogo construtivo e extremamente satisfatório. Gostaria em especial de agradecer o apoio e a confiança que depositaram em mim, o que me permitiu dispor de uma boa base para levar a bom termo as negociações com o Conselho e a Comissão.\nGostaria também de agradecer aos relatores de parecer das comissões competentes - a senhora deputada Laperrouze, pela Comissão da Indústria, da Investigação e da Energia, e o senhor deputado Schwab, pela Comissão do Mercado Interno e da Protecção do Consumidor - que participaram com base no processo de cooperação reforçada. Os pareceres adoptados por estas duas comissões complementaram e reforçaram de facto a proposta, tornando-a mais eficaz e simples para os consumidores finais: refiro-me aos consumidores, às empresas, associações de comércio, autoridades de supervisão e Estados-Membros. Gostaria de mencionar o excelente trabalho desenvolvido pelos funcionários do Parlamento e dos grupos que nos deram assistência nesta tarefa, bem como pelos representantes da Comissão e do Conselho.\nAo longo dos últimos meses, todos nós trabalhámos no mesmo sentido, tentando reduzir ao máximo o número de alterações e chegar a um consenso relativamente a determinados compromissos. Após dois meses de discussões técnicas tripartidas com as outras instituições, chegámos a um pacote de compromisso satisfatório com o Conselho, aprovado pelo COREPER em 27 de Junho último e que, se a votação de hoje for positiva, nos permitirá concluir o dossiê em primeira leitura.\nCom esta nova legislação, precisamos, por um lado, de manter os compromissos que assumimos a nível internacional - e dessa forma garantir uma coerência em termos de conteúdos entre o GHS das Nações Unidas e a nossa própria legislação - e, por outro, respeitar imperiosamente os actuais prazos previstos pela nossa própria legislação no âmbito do REACH.\nEsta nova regulamentação dar-nos-á a possibilidade de, em simultâneo, oferecer uma melhor protecção aos utilizadores destas substâncias e tornar as nossas empresas mais competitivas e eficientes. Com estas novas regras, idênticas em toda a parte do mundo, o mesmo produto não poderá ser considerado mais, ou menos, nocivo de país para país. Até agora não tem sido assim. Não só é ilógico, dado que a mesma substância apresenta os mesmos riscos onde quer que seja, como é extremamente perigoso quando estes produtos são exportados de um país para outro e acabam sendo consumidos por pessoas que não têm noção da perigosidade do produto que consomem.\nCreio, por conseguinte, não só para os utilizadores como para os trabalhadores deste sector, em especial num número extremamente elevado de pequenas e médias empresas, que a nossa proposta poderá ser uma resposta útil para todos os nossos cidadãos e para todos os europeus, assim como para os cidadãos de todo o mundo.\nAnne Laperrouze\nSenhora Presidente, Senhor Comissário, Senhoras e Senhores Deputados, antes de mais, gostaria de agradecer à senhora deputada Sartori, a nossa relatora, e aos relatores-sombra dos outros grupos. Penso que o trabalho que realizámos, que não foi fácil, com um texto de 2 000 páginas, introduziu verdadeiros progressos.\nFalarei primeiro em nome da Comissão da Indústria, da Investigação e da Energia, da qual fui relatora de parecer, e depois em nome do meu grupo político.\nA Comissão da Indústria adoptou diversas alterações, de entre as quais passo a destacar a mais importantes.\nA situação das PME deve de ser tida em linha de conta: elas manifestaram o seu interesse por este assunto durante a consulta preliminar realizada pela Comissão. De um universo de 360 empresas, 45% - que empregam menos de 250 trabalhadores - responderam a esta consulta através da Internet realizada pela Comissão entre os dias 21 de Agosto e 21 de Outubro de 2006.\nA nossa comissão fez questão de salientar que, para além da prestação da informação necessária, o GHS visa também proteger os consumidores e o ambiente. A nossa comissão apelou ao Estados-Membros para que introduzam um procedimento que ajude os fornecedores, em particular as PME, em determinados sectores de produção, a estabelecer a classificação adequada e a rotulagem e embalagem destas substâncias e misturas.\nA nossa comissão pugnou igualmente pela coerência com o REACH, tendo por isso apresentado alterações relacionadas com a tonelagem.\nFinalmente, para além do desejo de evitar a duplicação com disposições legislativas em matéria de embalagem, a nossa comissão achou conveniente prever a eventualidade de litígios quanto à interpretação dos requisitos do regulamento, neste caso entre o fornecedor e um Estado-Membro, e a necessidade de um procedimento para garantir uma classificação harmonizada.\nFalando agora na qualidade de relatora-sombra do Grupo ALDE, passo a indicar alguns dos princípios que nortearam a nossa abordagem.\nÉ evidente que saudamos esta iniciativa. Uma abordagem mundial é totalmente coerente com o objectivo de garantir uma protecção acrescida da saúde e do ambiente, bem como a comercialização dos produtos.\nUma vez que se trata de um sistema mundial, é importante que o futuro regulamento não imponha às empresas europeias restrições às quais as suas concorrentes internacionais não estejam sujeitas. É desejável que a proposta seja coerente com o REACH, tanto no que se refere aos prazos e à abordagem baseada na tonelagem como no que respeita aos anexos, em particular o anexo 6.\nNo que diz respeito às informações afixadas no produto acabado, uma vez que a Comissão optou por incluir o segmento pós produção, a regra que deve prevalecer é a da qualidade e pertinência da informação e não a da quantidade de informação. O nosso grupo considerou importante reconhecer a existência e o valor de outras fontes de informação, sobretudo as PME e a indústria, mas também a importância de instrumentos de comunicação como a Internet. A confidencialidade de algumas informações deve também ser protegida. Por último, esta legislação não pode conduzir a um aumento dos ensaios em animais.\nTendo em conta o calendário apertado e a complexidade dos anexos, relembro que os deputados decidiram não os alterar, com o objectivo, também, de facilitar as negociações. Esta foi uma concessão importante por parte do Parlamento. No entanto, apercebemo-nos, neste caso, de que um destes anexos apresenta um grave problema de conformidade imediata e de aplicação para as indústrias em causa.\nO anexo VI é uma lista de substâncias com classificações harmonizadas a nível europeu. No entanto, já existe uma lista semelhante, lista essa que a indústria utiliza para classificar e rotular as misturas. Porém, quando a transferência teve lugar foram introduzidas modificações nessa lista e ela tem ser aplicada imediatamente após a entrada vigor do GHS, enquanto no caso das adaptações técnicas o prazo é de pelo menos 18 meses.\nMuitas PME estão preocupadas com esta mudança. É essencial que cheguemos a acordo com o Conselho em primeira leitura e que se ponha termo à publicação de disposições com a maior brevidade possível, para que a indústria e os utilizadores tenham tempo para se adaptarem ao novo sistema e para o tornarem operacional até ao final de 2008.\nPor conseguinte, peço à Comissão que apresente uma solução que confira à indústria tempo suficiente para se pôr em conformidade com os requisitos do regulamento, sem sofrer um impacto desproporcionado.\nApós o trílogo, e salvo o problema com o anexo, o texto submetido à votação parece-me ser um bom texto. Gostaria apenas de realçar alguns pontos relevantes. Falámos muito das PBT. Estas substâncias não são cobertas pelo GHS das Nações Unidas. O Parlamento conseguiu que a Comissão Europeia se comprometesse a insistir na sua classificação a nível das Nações Unidas. O Parlamento conseguiu igualmente eliminar a divisão da categoria \"irritação ocular\" em subcategorias, o que teria sem dúvida conduzido a um aumento do número de ensaios em animais, sem oferecer qualquer verdadeira mais-valia. Convém assinalar também que os ensaios em seres humanos para efeitos deste regulamento são proibidos, e que o GHS das Nações Unidas é um processo dinâmico; foi encontrado um mecanismo que permite que as futuras evoluções do GHS das Nações Unidas sejam tidas pelo GHS europeu. A confidencialidade é protegida de uma forma equilibrada.\nA coerência com o REACH é garantida, e o Parlamento aceitou um limiar zero para o inventário e a notificação, embora inicialmente quisesse um limiar de uma tonelada para certas categorias de produtos. Este limiar zero foi aceite porque as substâncias e misturas exclusivamente destinadas a actividades de I&D foram excluídas do âmbito de aplicação do regulamento.\nPenso que realizámos um bom trabalho, e tenho esperança numa boa votação e numa adequada aplicação do GHS.\nAndreas Schwab\nrelator de parecer da Comissão do Mercado Interno e da Protecção dos Consumidores. - (DE) Senhora Presidente, Senhor Comissário, Senhoras e Senhores Deputados, em primeiro lugar, gostaria de dizer que foi com grande satisfação que a Comissão do Mercado Interno e da Protecção dos Consumidores tomou conhecimento do compromisso apresentado pela senhora deputada Sartori em nome da Comissão do Ambiente, da Saúde Pública e da Segurança Alimentar. Cremos que, com esta solução, encontrámos um excelente compromisso e uma excelente solução, tanto para as empresas do sector químico no mercado interno europeu - a maioria das quais opera a nível mundial - como para os consumidores, e acreditamos ter obtido também um muito bom compromisso para os consumidores com especial sensibilidade a estas substâncias.\nIsto só foi possível graças à amistosa e persistente cooperação entre os relatores. Gostaria em especial de agradecer à senhora deputada Sartori a forma como conduziu as negociações - inclusive no trílogo -, pois, em última análise, não restam dúvidas de que a sua postura foi decisiva para encontrar uma solução que respondeu a todas as expectativas.\nEstou satisfeito com o resultado, pois creio que, do ponto de vista do mercado interno e das empresas - em especial as empresas do sector químico, cuja experiência no âmbito do REACH no plano europeu nem sempre foi completamente positiva -, o Sistema Mundial Harmonizado de Classificação e Rotulagem de Produtos Químicos (GHS), enquanto guia universal criado pelas Nações Unidas, pode ser implementado no mercado interno europeu de uma forma muito pouco burocrática e com uma orientação prática. Isto proporcionará vantagens competitivas directas no mercado interno europeu para as empresas que operam neste mercado, pois a rotulagem harmonizada é um avanço significativo comparativamente à regulamentação em vigor, que ainda varia nalgumas zonas periféricas.\nSenhor Comissário, nos debates no âmbito do trílogo, também abordámos brevemente o facto de a legislação sobre o transporte destes bens de consumo ainda não ter sido harmonizada, pelo que valeria a pena ponderar se, nos próximos meses, não deveríamos focar a nossa atenção na legislação sobre o transporte de produtos químicos.\nEm segundo lugar, não abrir os anexos foi a decisão certa - e, neste ponto, queria apoiar a senhora deputada Laperrouze, do Grupo da Aliança dos Democratas e Liberais pela Europa, com quem também mantivemos uma excelente cooperação -, já que essa atitude nos permitiu evitar que a discussão se convertesse numa discussão semelhante à que tivemos relativamente ao REACH. Embora isso tenha significado que alguns pontos específicos, que gostaríamos de ter melhorado, tivessem de ficar de fora, a verdade é que, com a sabedoria de quem só tem de olhar para trás, esse foi, de facto, o caminho certo a seguir.\nGostaria, no entanto, de manifestar o meu total apoio ao desejo expresso pela senhora deputada Laperrouze de criar um prazo transitório no Anexo 6 para as substâncias que foram alteradas nesse anexo, pois, quando iniciámos as consultas, não podíamos prever que as mesmas não seriam abrangidas pela solução que havíamos acordado. Senhor Comissário, ficaria muito grato se pudesse comentar brevemente esta questão na sua resposta.\nOs utilizadores de bens de consumo químicos não estão, regra geral, familiarizados com a composição dos mesmos. Por isso, nas discussões sobre o GHS, atribuímos especial importância à sua implementação, de modo a que fosse prático para os consumidores. Embora não tenha sido possível considerar cada caso individual em pormenor, encontrámos uma solução - pelo menos para os bens de consumo mais comuns, como o detergente em pó e os detergentes em geral - que permite aos consumidores conhecerem as quantidades de substâncias químicas contidas nesses produtos e, ao mesmo tempo, continuar utilizá-los no futuro como o faziam no passado.\nTalvez possa dar-vos um exemplo: anteriormente, apenas era possível utilizar detergentes líquidos fornecidos em grandes frascos que continham vários litros. A existência de tecnologias cada vez mais respeitadoras do ambiente no fabrico e na utilização destes produtos permitiu que a quantidade de detergente líquido necessária fosse sendo mais e mais reduzida, de modo que, agora, os maiores recipientes encontrados nas cozinhas são de apenas 300 ml ou 500 ml.\nSem dúvida que a concentração das substâncias químicas presentes nestes produtos aumentou, mas, para os consumidores, isto é compatível com a actual solução GHS, pois sabemos que as pessoas utilizam estes produtos todos os dias, pelo que não precisámos de os submeter a uma classificação excessiva.\nCom isto, abordei todos os pontos relevantes para o mercado interno. Obrigado pela vossa atenção.\nGuido Sacconi\nSenhora Presidente, Senhoras e Senhores Deputados, numa situação como esta, em que estamos todos de acordo, o nosso debate corre o risco de se tornar repetitivo. Pela minha parte, gostaria de referir três breves questões de natureza política, uma vez que subscrevo inteiramente as palavras dos meus colegas.\nA primeira questão prende-se, naturalmente, com o reconhecimento pela perseverança que a relatora demonstrou desde o início. Desde as primeiras reuniões que demonstrou uma firme determinação política em concluir este dossiê em primeira leitura e a verdade é que quase nos pegou pelos cabelos e forçou-nos a fazê-lo. Contudo, todos nós ficamos convencidos da necessidade de o fazer se de facto queremos introduzir rapidamente legislação que nos permita obter uma classificação imediata de todas as substâncias e dar realmente um passo em frente rumo a normas mais estritas capazes de proteger a saúde do consumidor e - concordo com este ponto - a saúde dos trabalhadores que, em vários sectores, utilizam essas substâncias, sobretudo na realidade mais difícil da pequena empresa.\nEm segundo lugar, evitámos o perigo iminente de reabrir antigas discussões que haviam sido arquivadas com a adopção de REACH, o que considerava, devo dizer, extremamente importante. No plano internacional, creio que até o facto de REACH ser cada mais utilizado como um critério de referência a nível internacional por outros países, que o usam como modelo para adaptar a sua própria legislação, é extremamente satisfatório.\nDe qualquer das formas, as disposições relacionadas com a classificação de substâncias que estamos prestes a votar têm de ser adaptadas e integradas de modo a corresponderem à regulamentação principal em matéria de classificação, rotulagem e embalagem de substâncias e misturas, sem acrescentar quaisquer elementos novos.\nQuer isto dizer, em última análise, como todos os meus colegas saberão, que o GHS não é a última palavra sobre o assunto da classificação e rotulagem de substâncias. Discutiu-se muito sobre a PDT. Não podemos esquecer que se trata de um processo em curso. Por agora o que está em questão é implementar o que já temos e classificar as substâncias que já foram objecto de uma análise de risco por parte das Nações Unidas. Mal tenhamos novas categorias de risco e resultados de novos estudos, a GHS será actualizada em conformidade, logo este é um processo que continua.\nLiam Aylward\nSenhora Presidente, o ambiente e a saúde pública têm repercussões na vida de todos os cidadãos e esta legislação está directamente relacionada com ambos. O Parlamento votou a favor do sistema REACH agora em vigor, que protege a saúde humana e o ambiente dos perigos derivados das substâncias químicas. O REACH visa garantir que fabricantes e importadores procedem ao registo, avaliação e classificação das substâncias químicas. Parte essencial do sistema consiste em informar devidamente o público através da rotulagem dessas substâncias.\nNão posso senão louvar esta legislação e o senhor Comissário por colocarem o sistema europeu ao nível do GHS (Sistema Harmonizado a Nível Mundial para a Classificação e Rotulagem de produtos químicos) das Nações Unidas. Os cidadãos serão informados dos perigos das substâncias químicas por pictogramas que indicarão o risco de explosão, fogo, cancro ou veneno. Também a indústria sairá beneficiada, já que os países de todo o mundo aceitam o sistema GHS. E o público terá mais confiança nas substâncias químicas que estejam marcadas com sinais e rotuladas de forma clara e concisa.\nCarl Schlyter\nem nome do Grupo Verts/ALE. - (SV) Nós falamos imenso de tomar a iniciativa em matéria de alterações climáticas, mas, se tivéssemos de facto uma abordagem holística no domínio das questões ambientais, teríamos copiado directamente a legislação da ONU também neste ponto. Agora vamos eliminar a toxicidade aguda da categoria 5. Por que motivo fazemos isso? Bom, pela bizarra razão de que haveria um aumento do número de substâncias a classificar e rotular, caso o não fizéssemos. Assim, a razão nada tem que ver com qualquer tipo de lógica ambiental ou de saúde. Não, nós não queremos copiar a categoria 5 porque isso significaria aumentar o número de substâncias, não obstante o propósito de tudo isto ser dispormos de uma norma comum global que facilite o comércio, e que, no caso vertente, seria igualmente benéfica nos planos ambiental e da informação aos consumidores. Lutei pela reintrodução da toxicidade aguda da categoria 5, mas infelizmente não tive sucesso.\nOutra questão em que estávamos atrasados e em que lográmos avançar com o Conselho, na realidade, era no embargar a proposta de redução do limiar de classificação de 10 kg. Gostaria de agradecer ao Conselho por se ter mantido firme na sua posição. A Comissão também deu um contributo positivo. Se a proposta tem vingado, o REACH ficaria posto em causa. O REACH destinava-se a avaliar químicos, averiguar se eles são perigosos e registá-los. Porém, o REACH avalia e regista apenas os 30 000 químicos mais utilizados, os de maior volume de consumo. Os restantes 70 000 químicos que usamos ficarão sob a alçada desta peça legislativa. Por esse motivo, é muito bom termo-la aprovado e sem fixar qualquer limite inferior para efeitos de classificação dos químicos. Se a proposta tivesse passado, o GHS deixaria de funcionar como complemento do REACH. Estou muito satisfeito por isso não ter acontecido e, como tal, estou em condições de apoiar o presente relatório.\nFolgo também com o facto de termos sido capazes de evitar uma divisão desnecessária em categorias para efeitos de realização de ensaios em animais, por exemplo em matéria de testes referentes a irritação ocular.\nCom estas duas vitórias asseguradas, posso votar a favor deste relatório. No entanto, faço questão de salientar que, não obstante não termos conseguido aqui e agora incluir os químicos muito perigosos PBT nem uma lista para avaliação prioritária, pelo menos conseguimos um texto que diz que promoveremos essas medidas no âmbito da ONU e que elas serão introduzidas no sistema da ONU. Agora, gostaria de ver a Comissão aplicar-se a fundo na prossecução desse objectivo, porque ele é muito importante. Senão, a nossa política em matéria de substâncias químicas constituirá um fracasso em toda a linha. É muito importante que as substâncias em causa sejam rapidamente incorporadas no sistema da ONU, na medida em que nós não fomos capazes de dar o primeiro passo aqui.\nQual é o resultado, então, para os consumidores? Não serão tão bem informados como poderiam ser a respeito dos perigos inerentes aos químicos, o que é decepcionante. Mas, ao menos, passam a ter uma norma decente e protecção básica contra os químicos perigosos. Portanto, o compromisso alcançado acaba por não satisfazer ninguém, o que no fundo é capaz de ser o desfecho habitual.\nAvril Doyle\nem nome do Grupo PPE-DE. - (EN) Senhora Presidente, as substâncias são uma parte importante e natural do nosso ambiente. Ainda que muitas vezes não pensemos no assunto, utilizamos substâncias químicas todos os dias. O mundo moderno não poderia funcionar sem elas. Mantêm os nossos produtos alimentares frescos, os nossos corpos limpos, ajudam as nossas plantas a crescer, alimentam os nossos carros. Quando usadas e geridas adequadamente, as substâncias químicas permitem-nos não só viver mais tempo como ter vidas mais saudáveis.\nA regulamentação proposta, que completa o REACH e alinha o sistema da UE de classificação, rotulagem e embalagem de substâncias e misturas com o GHS (sistema global harmonizado) das Nações Unidas, constitui uma proposta razoável e equilibrada.\nSe queremos fazer uso dos benefícios das substâncias químicas a um custo razoável, haverá então que aceitar a existência de riscos. Impõe-se portanto encontrar um equilíbrio entre riscos e benefícios e controlar os riscos das substâncias químicas por meio de rotulagem cuidada, de uma regulamentação baseada na ciência e de tecnologias inovadoras. Importa também encontrar um equilíbrio entre uma correcta implementação das obrigações internacionais da União Europeia subscritas no Conselho Económico e Social das Nações Unidas na Cimeira Mundial sobre Desenvolvimento Sustentável, realizada em Joanesburgo, em Setembro de 2002, e os encargos desnecessários que pendem sobre as empresas, e que temos de evitar, de uma rotulagem excessivamente exigente e infuncional.\nNesse sentido, apresentei várias alterações à proposta. Considero que é especialmente importante garantir que a classificação de produtos não induz em confusão os consumidores ou os prestadores de cuidados de saúde. Demasiada informação é igual a não informação. Razão por que apresentei uma alteração sobre a embalagem de produtos com formas irregulares, por exemplo, ou de pequenas dimensões, que tornam tecnicamente impossível a aposição de um rótulo. Nestes casos, a informação sobre os perigos contida no rótulo deve ser fornecida com rigor mas de outra maneira, recorrendo, por exemplo, a uma etiqueta solta apensa à embalagem.\nGostaria de agradecer muito especialmente à relatora, a senhora deputada Sartori, por apoiar as minhas alterações e pelo excelente trabalho que desenvolveu neste relatório.\nMuito embora a regulamentação existente em matéria de identificação e informação sobre as propriedades perigosas de substâncias químicas sejam semelhantes em muitos aspectos, existem diferenças suficientemente significativas que dão origem a uma classificação diferente, uma rotulagem e fichas de segurança (SDS) diferentes. O sistema global harmonizado (GHS) combinará, assim o esperamos, estas classificações diferentes de uma forma eficaz. Os benefícios da utilização de substâncias químicas excedem largamente os riscos, o que sucede sobretudo depois da introdução da legislação relativa ao registo, avaliação e autorização de substâncias químicas, conhecida por REACH.\nTemos de estar cientes de que os produtos químicos, ao longo das várias fases, que vão desde a sua produção ao seu manuseamento, transporte e utilização, podem representar potenciais riscos para a saúde humana e para o ambiente. Neste contexto, esperemos que o acordo ONU-UE sobre o GHS represente uma melhoria em matéria de protecção da saúde humana e ambiental e proporcione também maior clareza às empresas, em especial às envolvidas no comércio internacional.\nOs potenciais riscos, embora geríveis, que as substâncias químicas envolvem sublinham a necessidade de legislação que verse sobre uma abordagem globalmente harmonizada às questões da embalagem e rotulagem das substâncias químicas; regozijo-me pois com o facto de o Conselho e Parlamento terem acordado um texto, em 27 Junho, e gostaria de felicitar novamente a nossa relatora pelo trabalho que desenvolveu neste complexo mas importante dossiê.\nJens Holm\nem nome do Grupo GUE/NGL. - (SV) Aqueles que trabalham na produção de químicos vão ser afectados de forma particularmente severa. De acordo com um estudo realizado na Finlândia, na UE há 32 milhões de cidadãos que são diariamente sujeitos a exposição a químicos carcinogénicos no seu local de trabalho.\nTemos o dever de proibir os químicos mais perigosos e de controlar todos os químicos, em geral. Era esse, precisamente, o objectivo da legislação REACH, que aprovámos o ano passado. O resultado final do processo REACH é discutível. Eu próprio considerei que o texto acabou por ser enfraquecido e esfrangalhado por acção dos representantes dos interesses da indústria, mas ao menos passámos a ter uma peça legislativa, que é o regime em matéria de químicos de âmbito mais alargado do mundo.\nO GHS (Sistema Global Harmonizado de Classificação e Rotulagem de Substâncias Químicas) prolonga e complementa o sistema REACH. O GHS visa passar informação acerca dos químicos aos trabalhadores e consumidores. O propósito é classificar e rotular os milhares de substâncias e misturas que nos rodeiam. O GHS é, na realidade, uma Convenção da ONU que agora temos de aplicar a nível da UE. Depois de aprovado o GHS - infelizmente não antes de 2010 para as substâncias e apenas em 2015 para as misturas -, todos os químicos passarão a ser facilmente identificáveis. O que está em causa é proporcionar melhor informação aos milhões de trabalhadores que estão diariamente em contacto com químicos, aos consumidores que têm de ter como saber aquilo que compram. A rotulagem contribuirá igualmente para melhorar a situação em matéria de saúde pública em geral e de ambiente.\nA indústria poderá retirar benefícios da maior coerência da legislação, que facilitará o comércio internacional. Trata-se de um grande passo em frente e é por isso que nós, no Grupo Confederal da Esquerda Unitária Europeia/Esquerda Nórdica Verde, apoiamos este compromisso.\nContudo, é uma pena que tenhamos ficado aquém daquilo que estava ao nosso alcance. As substâncias químicas persistentes, bioacumuláveis e tóxicas (PBT) não ficarão sujeitas a rotulagem. Por força deste compromisso, a questão das PBT será tratada no quadro da ONU. Trata-se de uma pecha grave do acordo. Porque não hão-de submeter-se as substâncias PBT ao mesmo regime de todas as outras e, como elas, ser rotuladas? Agora resta-nos esperar que outros países façam pressão na questão das PBT. Acredito que isso se venha verificar a longo prazo.\nNão obstante isso, estamos perante um bom compromisso, que permitirá que milhões de europeus, trabalhadores e consumidores, recebam mais informação acerca das dezenas de milhares de químicos que nos rodeiam. Esta é uma decisão da maior relevância para todos aqueles que padecem de cancro, alergias ou doenças cutâneas imputáveis à acção de substâncias químicas.\nGraham Booth\nem nome do Grupo IND/DEM. - (EN) Senhora Presidente, com o Regulamento REACH a começar agora a minar a indústria de produção, especialmente, em relação às pequenas e médias empresas, para além do número de ensaios em animais a aumentar vertiginosamente, aqui temos, sob a forma de um, mais algumas instruções dos zelotes da governação mundial da UNESCO sobre como classificar, rotular e embalar os resultados da sua ideia anterior.\nSendo igualmente sedentos do domínio global anti-democrático, a elite comercial e política que constitui a União Europeia apressa-se a implementar estas instruções, tal como o fizeram para implementar o regulamento REACH. Fizeram uma bateria de garantias sobre as suas boas intenções que poderão, por agora, proteger ou iludir as chamadas partes interessadas, mas que não satisfarão o grande número de desempregados que estas medidas já começam a produzir.\nUmas migalhas de reconhecimento pela opinião pública caem da mesa do Mestre, sob a forma de alterações 10, 12, 39 e 42, destinadas a colocar, em certas circunstâncias, a redução dos ensaios em animais à frente do cumprimento da letra da lei. Sei que isto se deve à pressão de grupos de influência ecológicos, de cujo apoio a UE tanto depende, e de facto, colocar o bem-estar dos primatas não humanos acima do dos humanos, como manifestado na alteração 40, vai seguramente pacificá-los; porém, encontrar alguma coisa que mereça um voto positivo no processo opressivo e obsessivo da legislação da UE é uma raridade digna de nota.\nQuanto ao resto, não há razão para que normas sensatas de segurança não devam ser adoptadas voluntariamente por Estados-nação democráticos com poderes judiciais independentes e acesso livre do público aos sistemas judiciários. Decretos supranacionais poderão parecer uma opção fácil, mas o poder centralizado arbitrário para que contribuem, com directiva atrás de directiva não solicitada, não só é o seu próprio mal como também o seu principal efeito tenebroso.\nA afirmação feita no considerando 7 de que esta legislação proporcionará vantagens competitivas à indústria e, como a alteração 1 acrescenta, sobretudo às pequenas e médias empresas, é simplesmente absurda. Como sempre, os grandes senhores de negócios da UE beneficiarão do fracasso dos seus pequenos concorrentes. Tornar-se-ão ainda um peixe maior num tanque mais pequeno ou então fogem para o estrangeiro e, em vez de fazer vénias à UE e às suas ridículas restrições, os comerciantes internacionais estabelecerão relações comerciais muito mais lucrativas uns com os outros do que connosco. A expansão está no fim. A recessão começou e sob a carga da regulamentação da UE, como por exemplo o relatório, as nossas economias afundar-se-ão como pedras.\nTodos os que têm este \"tacho” podem dizer ao seu eleitorado o que entenderem na sua própria língua sem receio de as pessoas virem a escutar o que os colegas dizem aos seus eleitores noutros Estados. Não há um eleitorado geral da UE e não poderá haver a não ser daqui a um século ou dois, quando toda a gente falar a mesma língua, e até que esse tempo chegue, a democracia da UE será uma anedota, e uma anedota pura e simplesmente obscura e perigosa. Mas os vossos privilégios são enormes. Por que razão haveriam de se preocupar com isto ou com a legislação contraproducente que os Senhores continuamente aprovam sem pensar? E por que motivo devo preocupar-me, se vou passar à reforma no final deste mês? Quando li a alteração 28, compreendi por que razão já estou cansado de todo este disparate. Diz o seguinte: \"Preparação\", a mistura ou solução composta por duas ou mais substâncias; mistura e preparação são sinónimos”. Bem, como é que sobreviveríamos sem este Estado super protector que nos explica este tipo de coisas, e como é que foi possível eu ter sobrevivido até à bem madura idade de 68 anos, quando passei os meus primeiros tempos de vida a \"roer” a pintura com chumbo das grades de madeira da minha cama de bebé? Creio que deu alguma coisa que fazer aos meus anticorpos nos tempos em que ainda tínhamos anticorpos.\nCada decreto opressor faz com que o colapso da UE esteja mais perto. Regozijo-me por isso, mas lamento os danos que os Senhores infligem em 27 antigas democracias, ano atrás de ano desastroso.\nJim Allister\n(EN) Senhora Presidente, faz-me todo o sentido que, a partir do momento em que as substâncias químicas são fabricadas e comercializadas a nível global, a descrição dos perigos relativos à sua embalagem não deva ser diferente de país para país, na medida em que não só é prejudicial para os consumidores como representa uma desvantagem para àqueles que descrevem com rigor os perigos existentes.\nContudo, constato que, de momento, o sistema \"globalmente harmonizado” não é tão global quanto isso. É mais esporádico do que global. Pergunto-me se outros países seguirão, ou não, o exemplo da UE de abraçar este sistema das Nações Unidas, e qual poderá ser o impacto para as empresas na Europa se não o fizerem.\nAo implementar estas medidas, precisamos de encontrar um equilíbrio. Em primeiro lugar, é fundamental que não haja uma sobre-classificação de produtos, o que confundiria os consumidores e os prestadores de cuidados de saúde.\nEm segundo lugar, precisamos de implementar estas obrigações internacionais sem impor encargos desnecessários às nossas empresas. Houve uma série de empresas que manifestou preocupação sobre o custo da implementação. Haverá elevadas despesas ligadas à TI e à formação, bem como custos de reembalagem, que não podemos subestimar, especialmente no caso das pequenas empresas. Faço minhas as preocupações manifestas sobre a possibilidade de as PME poderem tornar-se vítimas deste sistema, sobretudo se tiverem relações comerciais a nível externo, sendo que estes custos poderão muito bem ser superiores ao que poderão suportar.\nEija-Riitta Korhola\n(FI) Senhora Presidente, o debate sobre o recente Regulamento do Conselho sobre produtos químicos, REACH, ainda está presente na nossa memória. Foi um dos pacotes legislativos mais difíceis desta legislatura. O regulamento relativo à classificação, rotulagem e embalagem de substâncias e misturas que temos agora em mãos assenta, em parte, no Regulamento REACH que acaba de entrar em vigor e complementa-o. Razão por que levantou previamente algumas questões.\nO desejo da Comissão de consecução de um acordo em primeira leitura parecia inicialmente demasiado ambicioso, tendo em conta que o Parlamento tinha indicado previamente o seu interesse na legislação sobre produtos químicos. Por isso, resta-me admirar o trabalho credível e a liderança da minha colega, a senhora deputada Sartori, relativamente a este relatório de carácter técnico, e a forma como conseguiu evitar a tentação de revisitar demasiadamente o regulamento e, por exemplo, incorporar novos números e classificações de substâncias nos anexos, que teriam atrasado e mesmo evitado a entrada em vigor do regulamento.\nO relatório que analisámos nas comissões conseguirá provavelmente atingir as metas fixadas pelo regulamento, especialmente no que se refere à harmonização e simplificação da legislação. O Sistema Mundial Harmonizado de Classificação e Rotulagem de Produtos Químicos (GHS) e o sistema REACH complementam-se mutuamente, e não servem apenas para facilitar o trabalho dos produtores e distribuidores de produtos químicos. Ao invés, uma rotulagem clara e segura significará um regresso à confiança dos consumidores nesses produtos.\nQuando o trabalho da comissão começou, as pessoas manifestaram preocupação com o facto de o Regulamento GHS significar também que um grande número de detergentes, por exemplo, teriam de ser classificados como corrosivos. Desta forma, por exemplo, agentes para desentupimento de canos e produtos de limpeza líquidos teriam a mesma classificação e rótulo de embalagem e, como resultado disso, os consumidores não conseguiriam distinguir entre produtos perigosos e detergentes mais suaves. Agora, porém, as classificações das substâncias reflectem, tão bem quanto se pode esperar, o seu real potencial de perigosidade.\nO objectivo deste sistema, assentando como assenta num acordo da ONU, é que sejam aplicados os mesmos critérios à classificação e rotulagem de químicos e à regulamentação relativa ao transporte, venda e utilização de produtos químicos em todo o mundo. Nos termos do acordo, o sistema ficaria totalmente operacional até 2008. Ainda temos alguns meses pela frente.\nGyula Hegyi\n(EN) Senhora Presidente, a harmonização global da classificação, rotulagem e embalagem de substâncias e misturas é bem-vinda, e considero que a Europa deve ter um papel de liderança na protecção dos nossos cidadãos contra substâncias químicas perigosas. Toda a iniciativa tem origem nas Nações Unidas, sendo pois um projecto global. O sistema global harmonizado constitui um sinal promissor de cooperação global em questões ambientais. Esse o motivo por que apoio a adopção do compromisso relativo ao relatório Sartori.\nApresentei mais de 20 alterações a fim de assegurar a rotulagem adequada e a utilização segura de substâncias químicas. Dezassete dessas alterações foram aprovadas pela Comissão do Ambiente, da Saúde Pública e da Segurança Alimentar. Contudo, a mesma comissão para o ambiente também adoptou várias alterações apresentadas pela relatora que enfraqueceriam os direitos dos consumidores no que se refere à informação sobre os perigos das substâncias químicas nos produtos.\nO Grupo Socialista e eu votámos contra essas propostas porque os interesses dos consumidores são fundamentais para nós. Apraz-me que o novo compromisso não inclua estas alterações anti-consumidor, pelo que proponho a aceitação do mesmo. Não que esteja absolutamente satisfeito com o compromisso alcançado, mas não podemos atrasar a integração do GHS na nossa legislação.\nAceitemos, como um princípio de base, que as empresas não deverão invocar a confidencialidade comercial quando colocam substâncias químicas perigosas no mercado. No que se refere aos perigos, os consumidores têm direito a dispor de toda a informação necessária.\nObviamente que o problema está nos pormenores, portanto veremos como é que o GHS funcionará na prática, como é que indústria indicará nos produtos os sinais de perigo e se os consumidores compreendem, ou não, os sinais e avisos. A informação deverá ser clara e de fácil compreensão. Em suma, espero que o GHS venha a ser um bom instrumento para apresentar o resultado do REACH ao público, de modo a que os consumidores se possam sentir muito mais confiantes relativamente às substâncias químicas, o que também ajudará a nossa indústria.\nO meu assistente Gergely Simon, que trabalhou largamente neste e noutros dossiês, deixará o Parlamento num futuro próximo. Gostaria de lhe agradecer a sua contribuição para o nosso objectivo comum, a saber, uma Europa mais segura do ponto de vista das substâncias químicas.\nHiltrud Breyer\n(DE) Senhora Presidente, todos sabemos que as substâncias químicas são produzidas e comercializadas em todo o mundo e que os perigos e os riscos também são globais. Por isso, necessitamos de directrizes sob a forma de classificações e de rótulos claros que se apliquem à escala global. Gostaria que a União Europeia fosse a locomotiva que conduzisse uma rotulagem muito clara e uma forte protecção dos consumidores, mas ouvi aqui muitos intervenientes no debate dizerem que em vez de ser a locomotiva, a UE deveria ir sentada no vagão freio.\nConsigo viver com este acordo político, mas não estou muito satisfeita com ele. É verdade, conseguimos dar um passo importante na via de uma maior segurança para as pessoas e para o ambiente. Também me deixa satisfeita o facto de, apesar do relatório da Comissão do Ambiente, da Saúde Pública e da Segurança Alimentar relativo a valores-limiar para a rotulagem, que era demasiado favorável ao sector industrial - os volumes dos dados utilizados para a classificação deviam ter sido incluídos no rótulo -, termos conseguido limitar os malefícios nas negociações com o Conselho e a Comissão. Apraz-me que já não haja valores-limiar para o requisito da rotulagem e também já não sejam aceites mais falhas no sistema para a indústria e que o sistema de classificação proposto redireccione o enfoque para alternativas às experiências realizadas em animais.\nNo entanto, gostaria de ter visto melhorada a rotulagem de substâncias persistentes, bioacumulativas e tóxicas e de ter visto ser criada uma nova categoria de \"toxicidade aguda\", porque esse é um assunto extremamente actual, relativamente ao qual devíamos ter disponibilidade para tomar medidas. Considero que hoje enviámos um sinal importante no que respeita a maior segurança para as pessoas e o ambiente, mas não podemos descansar sobre os nossos próprios louros. Como é evidente, esta questão vai dar-nos muito que fazer no futuro, porque há muita coisa que pode ser melhorada.\nJean-Claude Martinez\n(FR) Senhora Presidente, já existem normas contabilísticas mundiais harmonizadas, normas alimentares globais do Codex Alimentarus, normas fiscais globais e convenções-modelo da ONU sobre dupla tributação. Agora vamos ter também normas globais em matéria de rotulagem, classificação, embalagem e tonelagem de substâncias químicas.\nA legislação mundial de 2002 do Conselho Económico e Social das Nações Unidas - o sistema geral harmonizado -está a ser transposta para o direito comunitário.\nNão há dúvida de que esta harmonização mundial é útil para todos - consumidores, utilizadores, PME -, mas, para além destas 2 000 páginas e dos procedimentos, anexos e listas, o regulamento mostra que a normalização europeia não é suficiente para lidar com problemas globalizados. Problemas globais carecem de soluções globais, o que significa que o Primeiro-Ministro britânico, Gordon Brown, tem razão: entre o nível da ONU e o nível global, o nível europeu está a ficar cada vez mais ultrapassado, obsoleto e, em última instância, inútil.\nZuzana Roithová\n(CS) Senhoras e Senhores Deputados, deixou de ser aceitável que estejam em vigor no mercado europeu único legislações nacionais relativas ao comércio, em particular, de substâncias perigosas, que são divergentes. A uniformização da classificação e da rotulagem de substâncias químicas e misturas perigosas constitui uma boa notícia para os consumidores, visto que a harmonização proposta melhora a protecção da sua saúde e do ambiente. Também é uma boa notícia para a competitividade da indústria europeia que este regulamento complexo relativo ao transporte, ao fornecimento e à utilização de substâncias perigosas não venha a ser aplicado apenas na União Europeia, mas também noutros países em todo o mundo, graças às recomendações das Nações Unidas.\nO regulamento está associado à REACH, mas também introduz classes e categorias de perigo. Os rótulos irão conter instruções para o manuseamento, assim como símbolos gráficos e pictogramas obrigatórios inteligíveis para as pessoas em todo o mundo. Os novos requisitos relativos à embalagem e aos fechos oferecerão protecção contra a abertura de recipientes por parte de crianças e também garantirão marcação para pessoas cegas. Os críticos advertem para os elevados custos relacionados com a re-rotulagem, a criação das chamadas \"fichas de segurança\" e a introdução de novas tecnologias de embalagem. No entanto, estou convencida de que estas despesas a curto prazo serão mais baixas do que as poupanças a longo prazo em custos resultantes da eliminação da actual rotulagem de produtos divergente em função do seu destino. O período de implementação, faseado entre 2010 e 2015, também atende suficientemente à indústria.\nAprecio muito o facto de a senhora deputada Amalia Sartori ter conseguido alcançar um excelente compromisso no Parlamento e também com o Conselho. Ela conseguiu uma grande melhoria e um equilíbrio, após muitos meses de discussão sobre as cláusulas da proposta da Comissão, e, por isso, faço um apelo para que adoptemos a proposta amanhã, na primeira leitura. É um exemplo do excelente trabalho realizado por relatores parlamentares, juntamente com as equipas do Conselho e da Comissão.\nGenowefa Grabowska\n(PL) Senhora Presidente, hoje estamos a discutir um regulamento muito importante que nasceu de um debate e, mais tarde, de uma decisão no quadro da ONU. Nesse debate, que culminou na adopção pelo Conselho Económico e Social de um sistema global harmonizado de classificação e rotulagem de substâncias químicas, todos os Estados-Membros, e não apenas a ONU, tiveram uma intervenção papel muito activa e relevante, em particular a União Europeia, e também a Comissão. Isso significa que o sistema a que se chegou é nosso, igualmente. Fazemos bem, pois, em adaptar agora os nossos regimes relativos à utilização de substâncias químicas ao dito sistema, assegurando concomitantemente, como é nosso desejo, a protecção dos nossos concidadãos - dos cidadãos da UE - e do nosso ambiente contra as consequências da utilização de substâncias perigosas, porque as presentes harmonização, classificação e rotulagem das substâncias perigosas visam melhorar o nível da protecção da saúde e, também, o estado do ambiente.\nA química afecta as pessoas da mesma forma em todo o mundo. Quando compramos um produto, não temos de saber o que ele contém. Mas devemos saber, contudo, que estamos a comprar um produto seguro. Devemos poder confiar no fabricante e no produto adquirido. Aqui, o nosso papel prende-se com a rotulagem, domínio em que continua a haver grandes discrepâncias. Um produto classificado como perigoso num estado é classificado como tóxico noutro, e como nocivo num terceiro.

have\ngood and bad things to say about this\nhomework assignment and the work you did\nover there first let me begin by saying\nhow super happy I am\nit's really humbling and I hope I'm up\nto that and that Iwill keep giving you motivating things\nto do in the coming semester let\nme start with bad things I have to say\nabout your work and then I will move on\nto the congratulations my main\ncriticism with students in this homework\nassignment is regarding the complaints I\nreceived by email about the grades that you receive ten people have contacted me\noverall asking me to review their paper\nwhich takes a lot of time and a lot of\nenergy\nmost of the complaints go this way I\nreceive an email that says \"well peer\nnumber one need a pretty good job got\nalmost all the points I wanted but peeeer\nnumber two oh this mean heartless\nperson look they removed half a point\nin this question I only received one\nand I should have received one and a\nhalf Olivier I know you are very busy\nwith all the work you do but you must\nrestore justice and restore the hope and\nthe faith of an entire generation by\nmaking this awful wrong right please\nreview this paper and give me alllll the points I deserve\"\nwell I won't tell you what I think about\nthis I will just give you hard facts the\nhard facts are that among the ten people\nwho contacted me - two received\nrespectively 2 and 2.75 points more this\nis because the peers are human\nand as humans they are like you and me\nthey live interesting and complicated\nlives some peers are heartbroken because\nthey broke up with their partner the\nprevious day or some peers are grading\nyou while they feed the baby and so it\nhappens and I'm here for this I'm happy\nto fix those kinds of errors this is my role so\ndo contact me if you believe this is what happens but the eight\nother peers end up having their grades\nbumped up by an average of 0.3 point out\nof 10 0.3 point out of 10 this is not\nmuch because there are four assignments\nand out of those four times the average\ncounts up for half of the final grade\nand so I ended up spending an entire\nafternoon and late into the\nevening grading all those papers\nand communicating with you only to bump\nup the average grade of 8 percent of the\nclass by an average 0.3 percent so we\nhave to ask ourselves here what we're\ndoing and how reasonable this really is\nand what I could do with this time\ninstead for another 150 people instead\nof just a few individuals and so I ask\nyou I implore you before you email me to\ncomplain about your grades to calculate\nhow much you realistically will obtain\nwith a review from me and to consider\ncarefully whether you are reacting\nrationally to a series of facts or\nwhether it is mostly the emotion the\ndisappointment or the anger that is\ntalking through your email be very\ncareful with this okay this is for the\ncomplaints now about the\ncongratulations I said the months ago\nthat it was a little prize for the best\npaper in each of the best paper or best\nhere grade grading and so here is the\nwinner for this time is Peeyush and Peeyush\nwrote a superb paper very very neat not\ntoo long with lots of short and clear\nexplanations and especially what we very\nmuch appreciated\nvery very nice distinction between the\ngeneral expression theory, the numbers\nput in, and then the final result this\nmakes it very easy to grade it turns out\neverything is correct but if it was\nincorrect then it would be very easy to\nfind out where exactly the mistakes come\nfrom because of that easy to see and easy to debug layout so congratulations Peeyush\nnow we have a little prize I initially\nthought I was going to offer a book as a prize\nbecause who doesn't like to receive a\ngood fluid dynamics book so this is my\nvery favourite book of course in fluid\ndynamics this is Hydrodynamica by Daniel\nBernoulli it was originally published in\n1738 and here's the English translation\nfrom 1960 of the whole book wonderful\npresent and I thought it would be good\nto offer this to the best student the\nbest contributor every homework\nassignment but then I thought what if\nthe students have the book already\nand what disappointment this would be so\nI changed my mind\ninstead of this we settled on having the\nlittle prize of 20 euros of Amazon voucher\nwhich you can spend on Amazon Amazon is\na very big website which is very\nwell-known because so many books\nabout fluid mechanics are available on\nthere so I'm sure Peeyush you will find\na good use for those 20 euros and\nagain there are another three times this\nprize for the three upcoming homework\nassignments so congratulations and for\nthe next assignment we will probably be\nlooking instead of instead of looking at\nthe papers we will probably be looking\nat the gradings for for the homework so\nhow well and how constructive and how\nhelpful the gradings are\nthis by the way is not my selection the\nmoney is mine but the selection is done\nby my colleague Jochen and Jochen was a\nstudent last year in this program so he\ndoesn't just have the experience of the\nteacher and instructor this year but he\nalso has experience of having graded and\nhaving being graded by peers last year\nand so I think this is a really good\nperspective that he can give when he\npicks out the best contribution every\ntime all right\noverall what to look for in the next\nhomework assignment well next assignment\nwe calculate force on a panel on a flat\npanel and there are three things I would\nlike you to pay attention on the first\nthing was not such a great success in\nthe first assignment it is the vector\nnotation the vector notation is very\nimportant in fluid mechanics and will get\nmore important as we progress through\nthe chapters when you write a vector\nequation it is a symbol where either an\narrow on top or usually n bar on the on\nthe bottom I don't care how you write it\nwhen you write a vector is equal to\nsomething that something must either be\nother vectors or it must have two or\nthree dimensions a vector has more than\none dimension this is a fundamental\nproperty of it if you write a vector is\nequal to 12 Newtons this is\ninherently wrong vector the length of\nthat vector would be the vector without\nthe arrow or without the bar and this is\ncorrect we express the length of that\nvector but if you keep the bar or the\narrow on the symbol and so you express a\nvector then you need to have either\nvectors or two or three lines on the\nother side of the equation so pay a lot\nof attention to this this is extremely\nimportant for us in fluid mechanics\nsecond thing is the clarity of the\nlayout of the papers too many of you\nsent papers which honestly I'm if I was\nto receive them from my colleagues or I know\nfor a fact if my colleagues were to\nreceive them from me then this would not\nwork at all\nand they would just send it back\nto me and say \"Olivier just redo the work please I don't have time\nto read through this. pay attention to how easy it\nis to follow the thread of your\ncalculations by aligning the equal sign\npay attention to clarity of the results\ndon't make it so that your peers wonder\nwhether this is zero or a point where the\ndecimal separator is make it very clear\nand very easy to read it is our\nexperience from last year that the\nexpectations of peers grow with time\nwith respect to clarity and so if you\ndon't want to lose marks on this pay\nattention and conversely when you are\ngrading your peers I encourage you to be\nsevere with the presentation and the\ncleanliness of the papers that you\nreceive and third thing is the same\nadvice as I gave last time which is\nhaving very nice and clear separation\nbetween the general expression theory\nthe number application and the final\nresults and this enables your peers to\nquickly estimate and find where the\nerror is and it makes our job a lot\neasier\nyour just read through your paper and\nyou say yes yes no yes yes done and so\nthis is exactly what you want to\ngenerate for your peers, a quick and easy\nreview separate those three things as\nclearly as you can right so overall I'm\nsuper happy with the energy that you put\nin this I am super happy with the\nquality of the work that you submit\noverall and I'm super happy with the\nquality of the reviews that you do as peers\ncongratulations keep up the hard work\nI hope you're hanging in there and I\nwill see you next time.

Hopkins \nYick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886), was the first case where the United States Supreme Court  ruled that a law that is race-neutral on its face, but is administered in a prejudicial manner, is an infringement of the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n##Background\nThe immigration of Chinese to California began in 1850 at the beginning of the Gold Rush.  They soon began to branch out to jobs in agriculture and made up a large group of railroad workers.  As the Chinese became more successful, tensions with white Americans grew.  White Californians were wary of the cultural and ethnic differences.  The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first of many pieces of legislation put into place to keep people from China from entering the United States. The government of California endeavored to prevent Chinese immigrants from working by requiring certain permits that they could not obtain, and passed legislation to prevent naturalization.   Many turned to the laundry business, and in San Francisco about 89% of the laundry workers were of Chinese descent. It was often the only job they could find.\nIn 1880, the elected officials of the city of San Francisco passed an ordinance making it illegal to operate a laundry in a wooden building without a permit from the Board of Supervisors.  The ordinance conferred upon the Board of Supervisors the discretion to grant or withhold the permits. At the time, about 95% of the city's 320 laundries were operated in wooden buildings. Approximately two-thirds of those laundries were owned by Chinese people.  Although most of the city's wooden building laundry owners applied for a permit, only one permit was granted of the two hundred applications from any Chinese owner, while only one out of approximately eighty non-Chinese applicants were denied a permit.\nYick Wo (j=jik1 wo4), was a laundry facility owned by Lee Yick. Lee Yick immigrated to California in 1861.  After 22 years of managing the facility, provisions set out by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors said that he could not continue to run it in a wooden building.  He continued to operate his laundry and was convicted and fined ten dollars for violating the ordinance.  He sued for a writ of habeas corpus after he was imprisoned in default for having refused to pay the fine.\n##San Francisco ordinance\nOrder No. 156, passed May 26, 1880\n##Issue before the Court\nThe state argued that the ordinance was strictly one out of concern for safety, as laundries of the day often needed very hot stoves to boil water for laundry, and indeed laundry fires were not unknown and often resulted in the destruction of adjoining buildings as well.  The petitioner pointed out that prior to the new ordinance, the inspection and approval of laundries in wooden buildings had been left up to fire wardens.  Yick Wo's laundry had never failed an inspection for fire safety.  Moreover, the application of the prior law focused only on laundries in crowded areas of the city, while the new law was being enforced on isolated wooden buildings as well.  The law also ignored other wooden buildings where fires were common—even cooking stoves posed the same risk as those used for laundries.\n##Opinion of the Court\nThe Court, in a unanimous opinion written by Justice Matthews, found that the administration of the statute in question was discriminatory and that there was therefore no need to even consider whether the ordinance itself was lawful. Even though the Chinese laundry owners were usually not American citizens, the court ruled they were still entitled to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Matthews also noted that the court had previously ruled that it was acceptable to hold administrators of the law liable when they abused their authority. He denounced the law as an attempt to exclude Chinese from the laundry trade in San Francisco, and the court struck down the law, ordering dismissal of all charges against other laundry owners who had been jailed.\nThe Court held that while the law wasn't discriminatory, it had been applied with \"an evil eye and an unequal hand\" in singling out Chinese laundry business owner Lee Yick.\n##Legacy\nYick Wo had little application shortly after the decision. In fact, it was not long after that the Court developed the \"separate but equal\" doctrine in Plessy v. Ferguson, in practice allowing discriminatory treatment of African Americans. Yick Wo was never applied at the time to Jim Crow laws. However, by the 1950s, the Warren Court used the principle established in Yick Wo to strike down several attempts by states and municipalities in the Deep South to limit the political rights of blacks. Yick Wo has been cited in well over 150 Supreme Court cases since it was decided.\nYick Wo is cited in Hirabayashi v. United States to recognize that: \"Distinctions between citizens solely based because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality. For that reason, legislative classification or discrimination based on race alone has often been held to be a denial of equal protection.\" However, the US Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Gordon Hirabayashi, the Japanese American who tested the curfew law and refused to register for the forced internment of people of Japanese descent during World War II.\nIn San Francisco there is a public school named Yick Wo Alternative Elementary School in honor of Yick Wo.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "5e7b6719-eb18-4622-869e-8ce0b6662960", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "知识性：历史事件"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "2ebe440b-6882-426c-8507-6524ed137c0b", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "1 法律相关，通顺\n2 语法错误少"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "c0496773-c5b5-48f4-a81d-8972d6c7ebc7", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "上下文没有逻辑性"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "e3a32d81-d012-491b-bd16-83ef9dc0b811", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 陈述事实"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

The Park authorities--people of imagination and of sentiment, as\nmust all be who would deal successfully with wild animals--had felt at\nonce that the name aptly embodied the tragedies and the romantic\nmemories of his all-but-vanished race. They had felt, too, that the\ntwo old braves who had been brought East to adorn a city pageant, and\nwho had stood gazing stoically for hours at the great bull buffalo\nthrough the barrier of the steel-wire fence, were fitted, before all\nothers, to give him a name. Between him and them there was surely a\ntragic bond, as they stood there islanded among the swelling tides of\ncivilization which had already engulfed their kindreds. \"Last Bull\"\nthey had called him, as he answered their gaze with little, sullen,\nmelancholy eyes from under his ponderous and shaggy front. \"Last\nBull\"--and the passing of his race was in the name.\n\nHere, in his fenced, protected range, with a space of grassy meadow,\nhalf a dozen clumps of sheltering trees, two hundred yards of the run\nof a clear, unfailing brook, and a warm shed for refuge against the\nwinter storms, the giant buffalo ruled his little herd of three tawny\ncows, two yearlings, and one blundering, butting calf of the season.\nHe was a magnificent specimen of his race--surpassing, it was said,\nthe finest bull in the Yellowstone preserves or in the guarded\nCanadian herd of the North. Little short of twelve feet in length, a\ngood five foot ten in height at the tip of his humped and huge\nfore-shoulders, he seemed to justify the most extravagant tales of\npioneer and huntsman. His hind-quarters were trim and fine-lined,\nbuilt apparently for speed, smooth-haired, and of a grayish\nlion-color. But his fore-shoulders, mounting to an enormous hump, were\nof an elephantine massiveness, and clothed in a dense, curling,\ngolden-brown growth of matted hair. His mighty head was carried low,\nalmost to the level of his knees, on a neck of colossal strength,\nwhich was draped, together with the forelegs down to the knees, in a\nflowing brown mane tipped with black. His head, too, to the very\nmuzzle, wore the same luxuriant and sombre drapery, out of which\ncurved viciously the keen-tipped crescent of his horns. Dark, huge,\nand ominous, he looked curiously out of place in the secure and\nfamiliar tranquillity of his green pasture.\n\nFor a distance of perhaps fifty yards, at the back of the pasture, the\nrange of the buffalo herd adjoined that of the moose, divided from it\nby that same fence of heavy steel-wire mesh, supported by iron posts,\nwhich surrounded the whole range. One sunny and tingling day in late\nOctober--such a day as makes the blood race full red through all\nhealthy veins--a magnificent stranger was brought to the Park, and\nturned into the moose-range.\n\nThe newcomer was a New Brunswick bull moose, captured on the Tobique\nduring the previous spring when the snow was deep and soft, and\npurchased for the Park by one of the big Eastern lumber-merchants. The\nmoose-herd had consisted, hitherto, of four lonely cows, and the\nsplendid bull was a prize which the Park had long been coveting. He\ntook lordly possession, forthwith, of the submissive little herd, and\nled them off at once from the curious crowds about the gate to explore\nthe wild-looking thickets at the back of the pasture. But no sooner\nhad he fairly entered these thickets than he found his further\nprogress barred by the steel-meshed fence. This was a bitter\ndisappointment, for he had expected to go striding through miles of\nalder swamp and dark spruce woods, fleeing the hated world of men and\nbondage, before setting himself to get acquainted with his new\nfollowers. His high-strung temper was badly jarred. He drew off,\nshaking his vast antlers, and went shambling with spacious stride down\nalong the barrier towards the brook. The four cows, in single file,\nhurried after him anxiously, afraid he might be snatched away from\nthem.\n\nLast Bull, standing solitary and morose on a little knoll in his\npasture, caught sight of the strange, dark figure of the running\nmoose. A spark leapt into his heavy eyes. He wheeled, pawed the sod,\nput his muzzle to the ground, and bellowed a sonorous challenge. The\nmoose stopped short and stared about him, the stiff hair lifting\nangrily along the ridge of his massive neck. Last Bull lowered his\nhead and tore up the sod with his horns.\n\n[Illustration: \"Last Bull, standing solitary and morose on a little knoll\nin his pasture.\"]\n\nThis vehement action caught the eyes of the moose. At first he stared\nin amazement, for he had never seen any creature that looked like Last\nBull. The two were only about fifty or sixty yards apart, across the\nlittle valley of the bushy swamp. As he stared, his irritation\nspeedily overcame his amazement. The curious-looking creature over\nthere on the knoll was defying him, was challenging him. At this time\nof year his blood was hot and quick for any challenge. He gave vent to\na short, harsh, explosive cry, more like a grumbling bleat than a\nbellow, and as unlike the buffalo's challenge as could well be\nimagined. Then he fell to thrashing the nearest bushes violently with\nhis antlers. This, for some reason unknown to the mere human\nchronicler, seemed to be taken by Last Bull as a crowning insolence.\nHis long, tasselled tail went stiffly up into the air, and he charged\nwrathfully down the knoll. The moose, with his heavy-muzzled head\nstuck straight out scornfully before him, and his antlers laid flat\nalong his back, strode down to the encounter with a certain deadly\ndeliberation. He was going to fight. There was no doubt whatever on\nthat score. But he had not quite made up his wary mind as to how he\nwould deal with this unknown and novel adversary.\n\nThey looked not so unequally matched, these two, the monarch of the\nWestern plains, and the monarch of the northeastern forests. Both had\nsomething of the monstrous, the uncouth, about them, as if they\nbelonged not to this modern day, but to some prehistoric epoch when\nEarth moulded her children on more lavish and less graceful lines. The\nmoose was like the buffalo in having his hind-quarters relatively\nslight and low, and his back sloping upwards to a hump over the\nimmensely developed fore-shoulders. But he had much less length of\nbody, and much less bulk, though perhaps eight or ten inches more of\nheight at the tip of the shoulder. His hair was short, and darker than\nthat of his shaggy rival, being almost black except on legs and belly.\nInstead of carrying his head low, like the buffalo, for feeding on the\nlevel prairies, he bore it high, being in the main a tree-feeder. But\nthe greatest difference between the two champions was in their heads\nand horns. The antlers of the moose formed a huge, fantastic, flatly\npalmated or leaflike structure, separating into sharp prongs along the\nedges, and spreading more than four feet from tip to tip. To compare\nthem with the short, polished crescent of the horns of Last Bull was\nlike comparing a two-handed broadsword to a bowie-knife. And his head,\ninstead of being short, broad, ponderous, and shaggy, like Last\nBull's, was long, close-haired, and massively horse-faced, with a\nprojecting upper lip heavy and grim.\n\nHad there been no impregnable steel barrier between them, it is hard\nto say which would have triumphed in the end, the ponderous weight and\nfury of Last Bull, or the ripping prongs and swift wrath of the moose.\nThe buffalo charged down the knoll at a thundering gallop; but just\nbefore reaching the fence he checked himself violently. More than once\nor twice before had those elastic but impenetrable meshes given him\nhis lesson, hurling him back with humiliating harshness when he dashed\nhis bulk against them. He had too lively a memory of past\ndiscomfitures to risk a fresh one now in the face of this insolent\nfoe. His matted front came against the wire with a force so cunningly\nmoderated that he was not thrown back by the recoil. And the keen\npoints of his horns went through the meshes with a vehemence which\nmight indeed have done its work effectively had they come in contact\nwith the adversary. As it was, however, they but prodded empty air.\n\nThe moose, meanwhile, had been in doubt whether to attack with his\nantlers, as was his manner when encountering foes of his own kind, or\nwith his knife-edged fore-hoofs, which were the weapons he used\nagainst bears, wolves, or other alien adversaries. Finally he seemed\nto make up his mind that Last Bull, having horns and a most\nredoubtable stature, must be some kind of moose. In that case, of\ncourse, it became a question of antlers. Moreover, in his meetings\nwith rival bulls it had never been his wont to depend upon a blind,\nirresistible charge,--thereby leaving it open to an alert opponent to\nslip aside and rip him along the flank,--but rather to fence warily\nfor an advantage in the locking of antlers, and then bear down his foe\nby the fury and speed of his pushing. It so happened, therefore, that\nhe, too, came not too violently against the barrier. Loudly his vast\nspread of antlers clashed upon the steel meshes; and one short prong,\njutting low over his brow, pierced through and furrowed deeply the\nmatted forehead of the buffalo.\n\nAs the blood streamed down over his nostrils, obscuring one eye, Last\nBull quite lost his head with rage. Drawing off, he hurled himself\nblindly upon the barrier--only to be hurled back again with a vigor\nthat brought him to his knees. But at the same time the moose, on the\nother side of the fence, got a huge surprise. Having his antlers\nagainst the barrier when Last Bull charged, he was forced back\nirresistibly upon his haunches, with a rudeness quite unlike anything\nthat he had ever before experienced. His massive neck felt as if a\npine tree had fallen upon it, and he came back to the charge quite\nbeside himself with bewilderment and rage.\n\n[Illustration: \"Only to be hurled back again with a vigor that brought\nhim to his knees.\"]\n\nBy this time, however, the keepers and Park attendants were arriving\non the scene, armed with pitchforks and other unpleasant executors of\nauthority. Snorting, and bellowing, and grunting, the monstrous\nduellists were forced apart; and Last Bull, who had been taught\nsomething of man's dominance, was driven off to his stable and\nimprisoned. He was not let out again for two whole days. And by that\ntime another fence, parallel with the first and some five or six feet\ndistant from it, had been run up between his range and that of the\nmoose. Over this impassable zone of neutrality, for a few days, the\ntwo rivals flung insult and futile defiance, till suddenly, becoming\ntired of it all, they seemed to agree to ignore each other's\nexistence.\n\nAfter this, Last Bull's sullenness of temper appeared to grow upon\nhim. He was fond of drawing apart from the little herd, and taking up\nhis solitary post on the knoll, where he would stand for an hour at a\ntime motionless except for the switching of his long tail, and\nstaring steadily westward as if he knew where the great past of his\nrace had lain. In that direction a dense grove of chestnuts, maples,\nand oaks bounded the range, cutting off the view of the city roofs,\nthe roar of the city traffic. Beyond the city were mountains and wide\nwaters which he could not see; but beyond the waters and the mountains\nstretched the green, illimitable plains--which perhaps (who knows?) in\nsome faint vision inherited from the ancestors whose myriads had\npossessed them, his sombre eyes, in some strange way, _could_ see.\nAmong the keepers and attendants generally it was said, with anxious\nregret, that perhaps Last Bull was \"going bad.\" But the head-keeper,\nPayne, himself a son of the plains, repudiated the idea. _He_ declared\nsympathetically that the great bull was merely homesick, pining for\nthe wind-swept levels of the open country (God's country, Payne called\nit!) which his imprisoned hoofs had never trodden.\n\nBe this as it may, the fact could not be gainsaid that Last Bull was\ngrowing more and more morose. The spectators, strolling along the wide\nwalk which skirted the front of his range, seemed to irritate him, and\nsometimes, when a group had gathered to admire him, he would turn his\nlow-hung head and answer their staring eyes with a kind of heavy fury,\nas if he burned to break forth upon them and seek vengeance for\nincalculable wrongs. This smouldering indignation against humanity\nextended equally, if not more violently, to all creatures who appeared\nto him as servants or allies of humanity. The dogs whom he sometimes\nsaw passing, held in leash by their masters or mistresses, made him\npaw the earth scornfully if he happened to be near the fence. The\npatient horses who pulled the road-roller or the noisy lawn-mower made\nhis eyes redden savagely. And he hated with peculiar zest the roguish\nlittle trick elephant, Bong, who would sometimes, his inquisitive\ntrunk swinging from side to side, go lurching lazily by with a load of\nsquealing children on his back.\n\nBong, who was a favored character, amiable and trustworthy, was\nallowed the freedom of the Park in the early morning, before visitors\nbegan to arrive who might be alarmed at seeing an elephant at large.\nHe was addicted to minding his own business, and never paid the\nslightest attention to any occupants of cage or enclosure. He was\nquite unaware of the hostility which he had aroused in the perverse\nand brooding heart of Last Bull.\n\nOne crisp morning in late November, when all the grass in the Park had\nbeen blackened by frost, and the pools were edged with silver rims of\nice, and mists were white and saffron about the scarce-risen sun, and\nthat autumn thrill was in the air which gives one such an appetite,\nBong chanced to be strolling past the front of Last Bull's range. He\ndid not see Last Bull, who was nothing to him. But, being just as\nhungry as he ought to be on so stimulating a morning, he did see, and\nnote with interest, some bundles of fresh hay on the other side of the\nfence.\n\nNow, Bong was no thief. But hay had always seemed to him a free\nlargess, like grass and water, and this looked like very good hay. So\nclear a conscience had he on the subject that he never thought of\nglancing around to see if any of the attendants were looking.\nInnocently he lurched up to the fence, reached his lithe trunk\nthrough, gathered a neat wisp of the hay, and stuffed it happily into\nhis curious, narrow, pointed mouth. Yes, he had not been mistaken. It\nwas good hay. With great satisfaction he reached in for another\nmouthful.\n\nLast Bull, as it happened, was standing close by, but a little to one\nside. He had been ignoring, so far, his morning ration. He was not\nhungry. And, moreover, he rather disapproved of the hay because it had\nthe hostile man-smell strong upon it. Nevertheless, he recognized it\nvery clearly as his property, to be eaten when he should feel inclined\nto eat it. His wrath, then, was only equalled by his amazement when he\nsaw the little elephant's presumptuous gray trunk reach in and coolly\nhelp itself. For a moment he forgot to do anything whatever about it.\nBut when, a few seconds later, that long, curling trunk of Bong's\ninsinuated itself again and appropriated another bundle of the now\nprecious hay, the outraged owner bestirred himself. With a curt roar,\nthat was more of a cough or a grunt than a bellow, he lunged forward\nand strove to pin the intruding trunk to the ground.\n\nWith startled alacrity Bong withdrew his trunk, but just in time to\nsave it from being mangled. For an instant he stood with the member\nheld high in air, bewildered by what seemed to him such a gratuitous\nattack. Then his twinkling little eyes began to blaze, and he\ntrumpeted shrilly with anger. The next moment, reaching over the\nfence, he brought down the trunk on Last Bull's hump with such a\nterrible flail-like blow that the great buffalo stumbled forward upon\nhis knees.\n\nHe was up again in an instant and hurling himself madly against the\ninexorable steel which separated him from his foe. Bong hesitated for\na second, then, reaching over the fence once more, clutched Last Bull\nmaliciously around the base of his horns and tried to twist his neck.\nThis enterprise, however, was too much even for the elephant's titanic\npowers, for Last Bull's greatest strength lay in the muscles of his\nponderous and corded neck. Raving and bellowing, he plunged this way\nand that, striving in vain to wrench himself free from that\nincomprehensible, snake-like thing which had fastened upon him. Bong,\ntrumpeting savagely, braced himself with widespread pillars of legs,\nand between them it seemed that the steel fence must go down under\nsuch cataclysmic shocks as it was suffering. But the noisy violence of\nthe battle presently brought its own ending. An amused but angry squad\nof attendants came up and stopped it, and Bong, who seemed plainly the\naggressor, was hustled off to his stall in deep disgrace.\n\nLast Bull was humiliated. In this encounter things had happened which\nhe could in no way comprehend; and though, beyond an aching in neck\nand shoulders, he felt none the worse physically, he had nevertheless\na sense of having been worsted, of having been treated with ignominy,\nin spite of the fact that it was his foe, and not he, who had retired\nfrom the field. For several days he wore a subdued air and kept about\nmeekly with his docile cows. Then his old, bitter moodiness reasserted\nitself, and he resumed his solitary broodings on the crest of the\nknoll.\n\nWhen the winter storms came on, it had been Last Bull's custom to let\nhimself be housed luxuriously at nightfall, with the rest of the herd,\nin the warm and ample buffalo-shed. But this winter he made such\ndifficulty about going in that at last Payne decreed that he should\nhave his own way and stay out. \"It will do him no harm, and may cool\nhis peppery blood some!\" had been the keeper's decision. So the door\nwas left open, and Last Bull entered or refrained, according to his\nwhim. It was noticed, however,--and this struck a chord of answering\nsympathy in the plainsman's imaginative temperament,--that, though on\nordinary nights he might come in and stay with the herd under shelter,\non nights of driving storm, if the tempest blew from the west or\nnorthwest, Last Bull was sure to be out on the naked knoll to face it.\nWhen the fine sleet or stinging rain drove past him, filling his\nnostrils with their cold, drenching his matted mane, and lashing his\nnarrowed eyes, what visions swept through his troubled,\nhalf-comprehending brain, no one may know. But Payne, with\nunderstanding born of sympathy and a common native soil, catching\nsight of his dark bulk under the dark of the low sky, was wont to\ndeclare that _he_ knew. He would say that Last Bull's eyes discerned,\nblack under the hurricane, but lit strangely with the flash of keen\nhorns and rolling eyes and frothed nostrils, the endless and\ninnumerable droves of the buffalo, with the plains wolf skulking on\ntheir flanks, passing, passing, southward into the final dark. In the\nroar of the wind, declared Payne, Last Bull, out there in the night,\nlistened to the trampling of all those vanished droves. And though the\nother keepers insisted to each other, quite privately, that their\nchief talked a lot of nonsense about \"that there mean-tempered old\nbuffalo,\" they nevertheless came gradually to look upon Last Bull with\na kind of awe, and to regard his surly whims as privileged.\n\nIt chanced that winter that men were driving a railway tunnel beneath\na corner of the Park. The tunnel ran for a short distance under the\nfront of Last Bull's range, and passed close by the picturesque\ncottage occupied by Payne and two of his assistants. At this point the\nlevel of the Park was low, and the shell of earth was thin above the\ntunnel roof.\n\nThere came a Sunday afternoon, after days of rain and penetrating\nJanuary thaw, when sun and air combined to cheat the earth with an\nillusion of spring. The buds and the mould breathed of April, and gay\ncrowds flocked to the Park, to make the most of winter's temporary\nrepulse. Just when things were at their gayest, with children's voices\nclamoring everywhere like starlings, and Bong, the little elephant,\nswinging good-naturedly up the broad white track with all the load he\nhad room for on his back, there came an ominous jar and rumble, like\nthe first of an earthquake, which ran along the front of Last Bull's\nrange.\n\nWith sure instinct, Bong turned tail and fled with his young charges\naway across the grassland. The crowds, hardly knowing what they fled\nfrom, with screams and cries and blanched faces, followed the\nelephant's example. A moment later and, with a muffled crash, all\nalong the front of the range, the earth sank into the tunnel, carrying\nwith it half a dozen panels of Last Bull's hated fence.\n\nAlmost in a moment the panic of the crowd subsided. Every one realized\njust what had happened. Moreover, thanks to Bong's timely alarm, every\none had got out of the way in good season. All fear of earthquake\nbeing removed, the crowd flocked back eagerly to stare down into the\nwrecked tunnel, which formed now a sort of gaping, chaotic ditch, with\nsides at some points precipitous and at others brokenly sloping. The\nthrong was noisy with excited interest and with relief at having\nescaped so cleanly. The break had run just beneath one corner of the\nkeepers' cottage, tearing away a portion of the foundation and\nwrenching the structure slightly aside without overthrowing it. Payne,\nwho had been in the midst of his Sunday toilet, came out upon his\ntwisted porch, half undressed and with a shaving-brush covered with\nlather in his hand. He gave one look at the damage which had been\nwrought, then plunged indoors again to throw his clothes on, at the\nsame time sounding the hurry call for the attendants in other quarters\nof the Park.\n\nLast Bull, who had been standing on his knoll, with his back to the\nthrongs, had wheeled in astonishment at the heavy sound of the\ncave-in. For a few minutes he had stared sullenly, not grasping the\nsituation. Then very slowly it dawned on him that his prison walls\nhad fallen. Yes, surely, there at last lay his way to freedom, his\npath to the great open spaces for which he dumbly and vaguely\nhungered. With stately deliberation he marched down from his knoll to\ninvestigate.\n\nBut presently another idea came into his slow mind. He saw the\nclamorous crowds flocking back and ranging themselves along the edge\nof the chasm. These were his enemies. They were coming to balk him. A\nterrible madness surged through all his veins. He bellowed savage\nwarning and came thundering down the field, nose to earth, dark,\nmountainous, irresistible.\n\nThe crowd yelled and shrank back. \"He can't get across!\" shouted some.\nBut others cried: \"He can! He's coming! Save yourselves!\" And with\nshrieks they scattered wildly across the open, making for the kiosks,\nthe pavilions, the trees, anything that seemed to promise hiding or\nshelter from that onrushing doom.\n\nAt the edge of the chasm--at this point forming not an actual drop,\nbut a broken slide--Last Bull hardly paused. He plunged down, rolled\nover in the debris, struggled to his feet again instantly, and went\nploughing and snorting up the opposite steep. As his colossal front,\nmatted with mud, loomed up over the brink, his little eyes rolling\nand flaming, and the froth flying from his red nostrils, he formed a\nvery nightmare of horror to those fugitives who dared to look behind\nthem.\n\nSurmounting the brink, he paused. There were so many enemies, he knew\nnot which to pursue first. But straight ahead, in the very middle of\nthe open, and far from any shelter, he saw a huddled group of children\nand nurses fleeing impotently and aimlessly. Shrill cries came from\nthe cluster, which danced with colors, scarlet and yellow and blue and\nvivid pink. To the mad buffalo, these were the most conspicuous and\nthe loudest of his foes, and therefore the most dangerous. With a\nbellow he flung his tail straight in the air, and charged after them.\n\nAn appalling hush fell, for a few heart-beats, all over the field.\nThen from different quarters appeared uniformed attendants, racing and\nshouting frantically to divert the bull's attention. From fleeing\ngroups black-coated men leapt forth, armed only with their\nwalking-sticks, and rushed desperately to defend the flock of\nchildren, who now, in the extremity of their terror, were tumbling as\nthey ran. Some of the nurses were fleeing far in front, while others,\nthe faithful ones, with eyes starting from their heads, grabbed up\ntheir little charges and struggled on under the burden.\n\nAlready Last Bull was halfway across the space which divided him from\nhis foes. The ground shook under his ponderous gallop. At this moment\nPayne reappeared on the broken porch.\n\nOne glance showed him that no one was near enough to intervene. With a\nface stern and sorrowful he lifted the deadly .405 Winchester which he\nhad brought out with him. The spot he covered was just behind Last\nBull's mighty shoulder.\n\nThe smokeless powder spoke with a small, venomous report, unlike the\nblack powder's noisy reverberation. Last Bull stumbled. But recovering\nhimself instantly, he rushed on. He was hurt, and he felt it was those\nfleeing foes who had done it. A shade of perplexity darkened Payne's\nface. He fired again. This time his aim was true. The heavy expanding\nbullet tore straight through bone and muscle and heart, and Last Bull\nlurched forward upon his head, ploughing up the turf for yards. As his\nmad eyes softened and filmed, he saw once more, perhaps,--or so the\nheavy-hearted keeper who had slain him would have us believe,--the\nshadowy plains unrolling under the wild sky, and the hosts of his\nvanished kindred drifting past into the dark.\n\n\n\n\nTHE KING OF THE FLAMING HOOPS\n\n\n\n\nTHE KING OF THE FLAMING HOOPS\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nThe white, scarred face of the mountain looked straight east, over a\nvast basin of tumbled, lesser hills, dim black forests, and steel-blue\nloops of a far-winding water. Here and there long, level strata of\npallid mist seemed to support themselves on the tree-tops, their edges\nfading off into the startling transparency that comes upon the air\nwith the first of dawn. But that was in the lower world. Up on the\nsolitary summit of White Face the daybreak had arrived. The jagged\ncrest of the peak shot sudden radiances of flame-crimson, then bathed\nitself in a flow of rose-pinks and thin, indescribable reds and\npulsating golds. Swiftly, as the far horizon leapt into blaze, the\naerial flood spread down the mountain-face, revealing and\ntransforming. It reached the mouth of a cave on a narrow ledge. As the\nsplendor poured into the dark opening, a tawny shape, long and lithe\nand sinewy, came padding forth, noiseless as itself, as if to meet\nand challenge it.\n\nHalf emerging from the entrance upon the high rock-platform which\nformed its threshold, the puma halted, head uplifted and forepaws\nplanted squarely to the front. With wide, palely bright eyes she\nstared out across the tremendous and mysterious landscape. As the\n glory rushed down the mountain, rolling back the blue-gray\ntransparency of shadow, those inscrutable eyes swept every suddenly\nrevealed glade, knoll, and waterside where deer or elk might by chance\nbe pasturing.\n\nShe was a magnificent beast, this puma, massive of head and shoulder\nalmost as a lioness, and in her calm scrutiny of the spaces unrolling\nbefore her gaze was a certain air of overlordship, as if her supremacy\nhad gone long unquestioned. Suddenly, however, her attitude changed.\nHer eyes narrowed, her mighty muscles drew themselves together like\nsprings being upcoiled, she half crouched, and her head turned sharply\nto the left, listening. Far down the narrow ledge which afforded the\ntrail to her den she had caught the sound of something approaching.\n\nAs she listened, she crouched lower and lower, and her eyes began to\nburn with a thin, green flame. Her ears would flatten back savagely,\nthen lift themselves again to interrogate the approaching sounds. Her\nanger at the intrusion upon her private domain was mixed with some\napprehension, for behind her, in a warm corner of the den, curled up\nin a soft and furry ball like kittens, were her two sleeping cubs.\n\nHer trail being well marked and with her scent strong upon it, she\nknew it could be no ignorant blunderer that drew near. It was plainly\nan enemy, and an arrogant enemy, since it made no attempt at stealth.\nThe steps were not those of any hunter, white man or Indian, of that\nshe presently assured herself. With this assurance, her anxiety\ndiminished and her anger increased. Her tail, long and thick, doubled\nin thickness and began to jerk sharply from side to side. Crouching to\nthe belly, she crept all the way out upon the ledge and peered\ncautiously around a jutting shoulder of rock.\n\nThe intruder was not yet in sight, because the front of White Face,\nthough apparently a sheer and awful precipice when viewed from the\nvalley, was in fact wrinkled with gullies and buttresses and bucklings\nof the tortured strata. But the sound of his coming was now quite\nintelligible to her. That softly ponderous tread, that careless\ndisplacing of stones, those undisguised sniffings and mumblings could\ncome only from a bear, and a bear frankly looking for trouble. Well,\nhe was going to find what he was looking for. With an antagonism\nhanded down to her by a thousand ancestors, the great puma hated\nbears.\n\nMany miles north of White Face, on the other side of that ragged\nmountain-ridge to which he formed an isolated and towering outpost,\nthere was a fertile valley which had just been invaded by settlers. On\nevery hand awoke the sharp barking of the axe. Rifle-shots startled\nthe echoes. Masterful voices and confident human laughter filled all\nthe wild inhabitants with wonder and dismay. The undisputed lord of\nthe range was an old silver-tip grizzly, of great size and evil\ntemper. Furious at the unexpected trespass on his sovereignty, yet\nwell aware of his powerlessness against the human creature that could\nstrike from very far off with lightning and thunder, he had made up\nhis mind at once to withdraw to some remoter range. Nevertheless, he\nhad lingered for some days, sullenly expecting he knew not what. These\nformless expectations were most unpleasantly fulfilled when he came\nupon a man in a canoe paddling close in by the steep shore of the\nlake. He had hurled himself blindly down the bank, raging for\nvengeance, but when he reached the water's edge, the man was far out\nof reach. Then, while he stood there wavering, half minded to swim in\npursuit, the man had spoken with the lightning and the thunder, after\nthe terrifying fashion of his kind. The bear had felt himself stung\nnear the tip of the shoulder, as if by a million wasps at once, and\nthe fiery anguish had brought him to his senses.\n\nIt was no use trying to fight man, so he had dashed away into the\nthickets, and not halted till he had put miles between himself and the\ninexplicable enemy.\n\nFor two days, with occasional stops to forage or to sleep, the angry\ngrizzly had travelled southward, heading towards the lonely peak of\nWhite Face. As the distance from his old haunts increased, his fears\ndiminished; but his anger grew under the ceaseless fretting of that\nwound on his neck just where he could not reach to lick and soothe it.\nThe flies, however, could reach it very well, and did. As a\nconsequence, by the time he reached the upper <DW72>s of White Face, he\nwas in a mood to fight anything. He would have charged a regiment, had\nhe suddenly found one in his path.\n\nWhen he turned up a stone for the grubs, beetles, and scorpions which\nlurked beneath it, he would send it flying with a savage sweep of his\npaw. When he caught a rabbit, he smashed it flat in sheer fury, as if\nhe cared more to mangle than to eat.\n\nAt last he stumbled upon the trail of a puma. As he sniffed at it, he\nbecame, if possible, more angry than ever. Pumas he had always hated.\nHe had never had a chance to satisfy his grudge, for never had one\ndared to face his charge; but they had often snarled down defiance at\nhim from some limb of oak or pine beyond his reach. He flung himself\nforward upon the trail with vengeful ardor. When he realized, from the\nfact that it was a much-used trail and led up among the barren rocks,\nthat it was none other than the trail to the puma's lair, his\nsatisfaction increased. He would be sure to find either the puma at\nhome or the puma's young unguarded.\n\n[Illustration: \"When the grizzly saw her, his wicked little dark eyes\nglowed suddenly red.\"]\n\nWhen the puma, at last, saw him emerge around a curve of the trail,\nand noted his enormous stature, she gave one longing, wistful look\nback over her shoulder to the shadowed nook wherein her cubs lay\nsleeping. Had there been any chance to get them both safely away, she\nwould have shirked the fight, for their sakes. But she could not carry\nthem both in her mouth at once up the face of the mountain. She would\nnot desert either one. She hesitated a moment, as if doubtful whether\nor not to await attack in the mouth of the cave. Then she crept\nfarther out, where the ledge was not three feet wide, and crouched\nflat, silent, watchful, rigid, in the middle of the trail.\n\nWhen the grizzly saw her, his wicked little dark eyes glowed suddenly\nred, and he came up with a lumbering rush. With his gigantic, furry\nbulk, it looked as if he must instantly annihilate the slim, light\ncreature that opposed him. It was a dreadful place to give battle, on\nthat straight shelf of rock overhanging a sheer drop of perhaps a\nthousand feet. But scorn and rage together blinded the sagacity of the\nbear. With a grunt he charged.\n\nNot until he was within ten feet of her did the crouching puma stir.\nThen she shot into the air, as if hurled up by the release of a mighty\nspring. Quick as a flash the grizzly shrank backward upon his haunches\nand swept up a huge black paw to parry the assault. But he was not\nquite quick enough. The puma's spring overreached his guard. She\nlanded fairly upon his back, facing his tail; but in the fraction of\na second she had whirled about and was tearing at his throat with\nteeth and claws, while the terrible talons of her hinder paws ripped\nat his flanks.\n\nWith a roar of pain and amazement the grizzly struggled to shake her\noff, clutching and striking at her with paws that at one blow could\nsmash in the skull of the most powerful bull. But he could not reach\nher. Then he reared up, and threw himself backwards against the face\nof the rock, striving to crush her under his enormous weight. And in\nthis he almost succeeded. Just in time, she writhed around and\noutward, but not quite far enough, for one paw was caught and ground\nto a pulp. But at the next instant, thrust back from the rock by his\nown effort, the bear toppled outward over the brink of the shelf.\nGrappling madly to save himself, he caught only the bowed loins of the\npuma, who now sank her teeth once more into his throat, while her\nrending claws seemed to tear him everywhere at once. He crushed her in\nhis grip; and in a dreadful ball of screeching, roaring, biting,\nmangling rage the two plunged downward into the dim abyss. Once, still\nlocked in the death-grip, they struck upon a jutting rock, and bounded\nfar out into space. Then, as the ball rolled over in falling, it came\napart; and separated now, though still very close together, the two\nbodies fell sprawlingly, and vanished into the blue-shadowed deeps\nwhich the dawn had not yet reached.\n\nUpon this sudden and terrible ending of the fight appeared a bearded\nfrontiersman who had been trailing the grizzly for half an hour and\nwaiting for light enough to secure a sure shot. With something like\nawe in his face he came, and knelt down, with hands gripping\ncautiously, and peered over the dreadful brink. \"Gee! But that there\ncat was game!\" he muttered, drawing back and sweeping a comprehensive\ngaze across the stupendous landscape, as if challenging denial of his\nstatement. Obviously the silences were of the same opinion, for there\ncame no suggestion of dissent. Carefully he rose to his feet and\npressed on towards the cave.\n\nWithout hesitation he entered, for he knew that the puma's mate some\nweeks before had been shot, far down in the valley. He found the\nkittens asleep and began to fondle them. At his touch, and the smell\nof him, they awoke, spitting and clawing with all their mother's\ncourage. Young as they were, their claws drew blood abundantly.\n\"Gritty little devils!\" growled the man good-naturedly, snatching\nback his hand and wiping the blood on his trouser-leg. Then he took\noff his coat, threw it over the troublesome youngsters, rolled them in\nit securely, so that not one protesting claw could get out, and\nstarted back to the camp with the grumbling and uneasy bundle in his\narms.\n\nThree months later, the two puma cubs, sleek, fat, full of gayety as\ntwo kittens of like age, and convinced by this time that man was the\nsource and origin of all good things, were sold to a travelling\ncollector. One, the female, was sent down to a zoological garden on\nthe Pacific coast. The other, the male, much the larger and at the\nsame time the more even-tempered and amenable to teaching, found its\nway to the cages of an animal-trainer in the East.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\n\"King's kind of ugly to-night, seems to me; better keep yer eyes\npeeled!\" said Andy Hansen, the assistant trainer, the big,\nyellow-haired Swede who knew not fear. Neither did he know impatience\nor irritability; and so all the animals, as a rule, were on their good\nbehavior under his calm, masterful, blue eye. Yet he was tactful with\nthe beasts, and given to humoring their moods as far as convenient\nwithout ever letting them guess it.\n\n\"Oh, you go chase yourself, Andy!\" replied Signor Tomaso, the trainer,\nwith a strong New England accent. \"If I got to look out for King, I'd\nbetter quit the business. Don't you go trying to make trouble between\nfriends, Andy.\"\n\n\"Of course, Bill, I know he'd never try to maul _you_,\" explained\nHansen seriously, determined that he should not be misunderstood in\nthe smallest particular. \"But he's acting curious. Look out he don't\nget into a scrap with some of the other animals.\"\n\n\"I reckon I kin keep 'em all straight,\" answered the trainer dryly, as\nhe turned away to get ready for the great performance which the\naudience, dimly heard beyond the canvas walls, was breathlessly\nawaiting.\n\nThe trainer's name was William Sparks, and his birthplace Big\nChebeague, Maine; but his lean, swarthy face and piercing, green-brown\neyes, combined with the craving of his audiences for a touch of the\nromantic, had led him to adopt the more sonorous pseudonym of \"Signor\nTomaso.\" He maintained that if he went under his own name, nobody\nwould ever believe that what he did could be anything wonderful.\nExcept for this trifling matter of the name, there was no fake about\nSignor Tomaso. He was a brilliant animal-trainer, as unacquainted with\nfear as the Swede, as dominant of eye, and of immeasurably greater\nexperience. But being, at the same time, more emotional, more\ntemperamental than his phlegmatic assistant, his control was sometimes\nless steady, and now and again he would have to assert his authority\nwith violence. He was keenly alive to the varying personalities of his\nbeasts, naturally, and hence had favorites among them. His especial\nfavorite, who heartily reciprocated the attachment, was the great\npuma, King, the most intelligent and amiable of all the wild animals\nthat had ever come under his training whip.\n\nAs Hansen's success with the animals, during the few months of his\nexperience as assistant, had been altogether phenomenal, his chief\nfelt a qualm of pique upon being warned against the big puma. He had\ntoo just an appreciation of Hansen's judgment, however, to quite\ndisregard the warning, and he turned it over curiously in his mind as\nhe went to his dressing-room. Emerging a few minutes later in the\nblack-and-white of faultless evening dress, without a speck on his\nvarnished shoes, he moved down along the front of the cages,\naddressing to the occupant of each, as he passed, a sharp,\nauthoritative word which brought it to attention.\n\nWith the strange, savage smell of the cages in his nostrils, that\nbitter, acrid pungency to which his senses never grew blunted, a new\nspirit of understanding was wont to enter Tomaso's brain. He would\nfeel a sudden kinship with the wild creatures, such a direct and\ninstant comprehension as almost justified his fancy that in some\nprevious existence he had himself been a wild man of the jungle and\nspoken in their tongue. As he looked keenly into each cage, he knew\nthat the animal whose eyes for that moment met his was in untroubled\nmood. This, till he came to the cage containing the latest addition to\nhis troupe, a large cinnamon bear, which was rocking restlessly to\nand fro and grumbling to itself. The bear was one which had been long\nin captivity and well trained. Tomaso had found him docile, and clever\nenough to be admitted at once to the performing troupe. But to-night\nthe beast's eyes were red with some ill-humor. Twice the trainer spoke\nto him before he heeded; but then he assumed instantly an air of\nmildest subservience. The expression of a new-weaned puppy is not more\ninnocently mild than the look which a bear can assume when it so\ndesires.\n\n\"Ah, ha! old sport! So it's you that's got a grouch on to-night; I'll\nkeep an eye on you!\" he muttered to himself. He snapped his heavy whip\nonce, and the bear obediently sat up on its haunches, its great paws\nhanging meekly. Tomaso looked it sharply in the eye. \"Don't forget,\nnow, and get funny!\" he admonished. Then he returned to the first\ncage, which contained the puma, and went up close to the bars. The\ngreat cat came and rubbed against him, purring harshly.\n\n\"There ain't nothing the matter with _you_, boy, I reckon,\" said\nTomaso, scratching him affectionately behind the ears. \"Andy must have\nwheels in his head if he thinks I've got to keep my eyes peeled on\n_your_ account.\"\n\nOut beyond the iron-grilled passage, beyond the lighted canvas walls,\nthe sharp, metallic noises of the workmen setting up the great\nperforming-cage came to a stop. There was a burst of music from the\norchestra. That, too, ceased. The restless hum of the unseen masses\naround the arena died away into an expectant hush. It was time to go\non. At the farther end of the passage, by the closed door leading to\nthe performing cage, Hansen appeared. Tomaso opened the puma's cage.\nKing dropped out with a soft thud of his great paws, and padded\nswiftly down the passage, his master following. Hansen slid wide the\ndoor, admitting a glare of light, a vast, intense rustle of\nexcitement; and King marched majestically out into it, eying calmly\nthe tier on climbing tier of eager faces. It was his customary\nprivilege, this, to make the entrance alone, a good half minute ahead\nof the rest of the troupe; and he seemed to value it. Halfway around\nthe big cage he walked, then mounted his pedestal, sat up very\nstraight, and stared blandly at the audience. A salvo of clapping ran\nsmartly round the tiers--King's usual tribute, which he had so learned\nto expect that any failure of it would have dispirited him for the\nwhole performance.\n\nSignor Tomaso had taken his stand, whip in hand, just inside the cage,\nwith Hansen opposite him, to see that the animals, on entry, went each\nstraight to his own bench or pedestal. Any mistake in this connection\nwas sure to lead to trouble, each beast being almost childishly\njealous of its rights. Inside the long passage an attendant was\nopening one cage after another; and in a second more the animals began\nto appear in procession, filing out between the immaculate Signor and\nthe roughly clad Swede. First came a majestic white Angora goat,\ncarrying high his horned and bearded head, and stepping most daintily\nupon slim, black hoofs. Close behind, and looking just ready to pounce\nupon him but for dread of the Signor's eye, came slinking stealthily a\nspotted black-and-yellow leopard, ears back and tail twitching. He\nseemed ripe for mischief, as he climbed reluctantly on to his pedestal\nbeside the goat; but he knew better than to even bare a claw. And as\nfor the white goat, with his big golden eyes superciliously half\nclosed, he ignored his dangerous neighbor completely, while his jaws\nchewed nonchalantly on a bit of brown shoe-lace which he had picked up\nin the passage.\n\nClose behind the leopard came a bored-looking lion, who marched with\nlistless dignity straight to his place. Then another lion, who paused\nin the doorway and looked out doubtfully, blinking with distaste at\nthe strong light. Tomaso spoke sharply, like the snap of his whip,\nwhereupon the lion ran forward in haste. But he seemed to have\nforgotten which was his proper pedestal, for he hopped upon the three\nnearest in turn, only to hop down again with apologetic alacrity at\nthe order of the cracking whip. At last, obviously flustered, he\nreached a pedestal on which he was allowed to remain. Here he sat,\nblinking from side to side and apparently much mortified.\n\nThe lion was followed by a running wolf, who had shown his teeth\nsavagely when the lion, for a moment, trespassed upon his pedestal.\nThis beast was intensely interested in the audience, and, as soon as\nhe was in his place, turned his head and glared with green, narrowed\neyes at the nearest spectators, as if trying to stare them out of\ncountenance. After the wolf come a beautiful Bengal tiger, its\nblack-and-golden stripes shining as if they had been oiled. He glided\nstraight to his stand, sniffed at it superciliously, and then lay down\nbefore it. The whip snapped sharply three times, but the tiger only\nshut his eyes tight. The audience grew hushed. Tomaso ran forward,\nseized the beast by the back of the neck, and shook him roughly.\nWhereupon the tiger half rose, opened his great red mouth like a\ncavern, and roared in his master's face. The audience thrilled from\ncorner to corner, and a few cries came from frightened women.\n\nThe trainer paused for an instant, to give full ef\n", "final_result_str": "repair", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "475ede77-9f62-415d-afc7-f75fc590dc6b", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "1.各段落关联性不强\n2. 语法发错误多"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "3357b9d3-a7c3-4aec-bcfd-e0d0cfc003b9", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "need_repair", "evidence": "前置目录的书籍"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "fe025361-025e-4377-a781-c3a6f8e9abd3", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "文本有逻辑性"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "d12f553f-ebc5-49d8-abf9-bded5906c217", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 知识性内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

The desire to obtain as large a representation\nof stock as possible, and to extend the advantages of the Association as\nwidely among breeders as they could, has induced the committees on the\nvarious classes of stock to hold open their books, and the delays\nincident upon tracing doubtful pedigrees, through in many instances a\nlong correspondence with owners and breeders, have prevented them from\nfurnishing the copy to the Publication Committee in season to have the\nwork finished sooner. Every care has been taken to have the records\nperfect, and to admit no pedigrees of doubtful character. It is believed\nthis has been successfully accomplished, and that the animals here\nrecorded may be relied upon as of undoubted purity of blood.\n\n                              H. A.

It must be\nadmitted that the Short Horns present themselves to notice under\ncircumstances of peculiar interest; possessing in themselves a\ncombination of desirable qualities, and rendered attractive to the eye\nby their splendid frames, and beautiful varied colors, it is not\nsurprising they have become objects of public interest. Great temptation\nis laid before a class of men to manufacture _pure bloods_ to suit their\npurposes, being able to afford them at a much less price than a genuine\narticle. Great facilities are within the reach of all at the present\nday, who desire to become acquainted with their history and their great\nperformance at the shambles, and for the dairy, and general usefulness\nas farm stock.\n\nThe beef producers, and beef dealers uniformly acknowledge their great\nsuperiority over common stock. In the month of November, 1817, the\nimproved Durham Short Horn Bull, Young Denton, (963) then sixteen months\nold, arrived in Boston, sent out from England by Samuel Williams, of\nLondon, a present to his brother Stephen Williams, of Northboro',\nWorcester Co., Mass.; he remained there until 1827 or 1828, when he was\ntaken to the State of Maine, where he died, April 16, 1830. His Sire was\nDenton, (198); his G. Sire Comet, (155); was sold for 1000 guineas in\n1810. In 1822, Mr. Williams received the Short Horn Cow, Arabella, from\nthe same source; her Sire was North Star, (460); Dam, Aurora by Comet,\n(155). Both of these animals were bred by that eminent breeder, John\nWetherel, who was one of the four spirited purchasers of Comet (155) in\n1810, at the price before mentioned. It has been claimed by those who\nhave gone before us, that Young Denton (963) was the first improved\nDurham Short Horn Bull, imported into the United States. From these two\nimported animals sprang a very numerous progeny, and their descendants\nare scattered through all of the Northern States. In 1823 the Bull\nAdmiral, (1608) and Cow Arabella, were sent out from the same herd as a\npresent from Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin, to the Massachusetts Agricultural\nSociety, who placed them under the charge of E. Hersey Derby, Esq., of\nSalem, Mass., who bred from them successfully a few years, when the\nstock on hand was sold and removed to Hartford Co., Conn. Many animals\nof the present day, trace back to this importation. About the same\nperiod, Israel Monson, Esq., of Boston, a large landholder, brought out\nthe Cow, Tube Rose, also from the herd of Mr. Wetherel. She produced but\none Heifer in this country, (Rose by Young Denton), which, with her\nMother and Daughter, (Nellie by Admiral, (1608)) died about the year\n1830.\n\nIn 1823. Mr. John S. Skinner, then editor of the American Farmer,\nBaltimore, imported two Heifers, Conquest and Pansey, and a Bull,\nWashington, (1566) for Gen. Stephen Van Renselaer, of Albany, N. Y., all\nfrom the herd of Mr. Champion, Blythe, England. Many of their\ndescendants are recorded in this book, and are scattered through all the\nNorthern States. All of the above mentioned animals possessed a very\nhigh order of excellence for milking capacity, both quality and\nquantity, and their descendants maintain that character in a very high\ndegree at the present day.\n\nIn 1829, Mr. Benjamin Rodman, of New Bedford, Mass., imported three\nHeifers, Adaliza, Dulcibella, and Galatea, and a Bull, Devonshire,\n(966) bred by Mr. Whitaker, of Burley, Yorkshire,--these were selected\nby Mr. Francis Rotch, then in England. One of them, Dulcibella was in\ncalf when purchased, and produced Dew Drop, by Charles, (878) from which\nhas sprung a numerous family of Cows, celebrated for their superior\ndairy qualities.\n\nIn 1830, Mr. Enoch Silsby, of Boston, Mass., sent to England and brought\nout the Cow, Boston, by Sir Charles, (1440) and Bull, Boston, (1735)\nboth bred by Mr. Curry, of Brandon. These animals left a numerous\nprogeny, justly celebrated for strong constitutions as well as rich\nhandling and dairy qualities; many of their descendants are also\nrecorded in this book.\n\nIt is not claimed the instances of Short Horn excellence herein cited\nare superior to many others; they are those that have been noted and the\nfacts made public.\n\n\n_Beef Qualities._\n\nIn 1843 a thorough bred Heifer, Regina, three years and a half old,\nhaving nursed her calf through the summer, was in thin flesh in the\nfall. Her bag having been deformed by accident, and she not being in\ncalf, was put into a distillery stall in November, fed on slops and\nstraw, and slaughtered in April following, and her dressed weight, beef,\nhide and tallow, 1005 pounds; beef of the finest quality.\n\nIn 1857, Lucy, a thorough bred Heifer, was turned to pasture with\nreference to making beef of her, she having proved barren, being then\nnearly four years old. She was put into the stable in November, fed on\ngood hay and a very small quantity of meal, it being the design to feed\nher a long time. On the fourth day of January following she was sold to\na butcher for ten dollars per cwt., estimated at 1,000 pounds. She was\nslaughtered at Hartford, Conn., being four years and five months old,\nhaving eaten less than _two bushels_ of meal in her life. Her beef was\nsold, all the prime pieces at twenty-five cents per pound; was a very\nbeautiful animal, with handling properties of the very highest order of\nexcellence.\n\nIn the month of January, 1862, Pocahontas, a thorough bred Heifer, was\nsold and slaughtered, then five years and one month old. Her dressed\nweight was as follows: hide, ninety pounds; tallow, one hundred and\ntwenty-seven pounds; quarters, eleven hundred and eighteen pounds; total\ndressed weight, thirteen hundred and thirty-five pounds; was sold for\neight cents per pound, making $106.80. Her feed, other than hay and\ngrass, being twenty and one-half bushels of meal in all.\n\n\n_Dairy Qualities._\n\nLucilla, a thorough bred Heifer, at four years old, gave in June\nfifty-five pounds of milk on an average for one month; her greatest\nyield in one day was fifty-nine pounds and eight ounces, and during this\nmonth yielded fourteen pounds and eight ounces of butter in one week;\nher feed, grass, with three quarts of meal daily. At five years old the\nfirst week in June, her milk yielded fifteen pounds three ounces of\nbutter, on grass only.\n\nDorothy, a thorough bred Cow, gave thirty-nine pounds eight ounces of\nmilk per day, three months after calving, on grass only; and in seven\ndays made fifteen pounds one ounce of butter, in October.\n\nNymph 5th, in the month of June, 1860, gave twenty-four quarts of milk\ndaily for two weeks in succession, and made butter at the rate of two\npounds four ounces per day, or fifteen pounds three ounces per week, on\ngrass only.\n\nRose 2d, a thorough bred Cow, produced seventeen pounds four ounces of\nbutter from one week's milk in June, on grass only.\n\n\n_Longevity._\n\nPrincess, a thorough bred Cow, bred regularly up to eighteen years old;\nwas then dried off and turned to grass for beef, and slaughtered in the\nfall without stall-feeding, and made merchantable beef.\n\nArabella, a thorough-bred Cow, bred regularly up to seventeen years old,\nand died in 1861, at eighteen years old.\n\nLilac 4th, a thorough-bred Cow, bred regularly up to nineteen years old,\nand died in 1861.\n\n\n_Scale of Points for Short Horn Bulls._\n\n                                                                   Points.\n\n  ART. 1.--Purity of breed on male and female side; sire and dam\n  reputed for docility of disposition, early maturity, and aptitude\n  to fatten.

I.\n\n  [Illustration]\n\n  LONDON:\n  RICHARD BENTLEY & SON, NEW BURLINGTON STREET,\n  Publishers in Ordinary to Her Majesty.\n  MDCCCXCVI.\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\n\nThe object aimed at in the following pages is to show the place that\nwomen have held in our national life, from the days when what we call\nthe Saxon race was dominant in England, down to the present time. For\nthis purpose those phases of our social history have been dwelt upon\nwhich display most clearly the changes that have taken place in the\nposition of women, and the influence of great forces like the Church\nand Feudalism. Names have been used as illustrations, and not with any\nintention of adding to biographical literature. Instances that are\nthe most striking individually do not always serve best as examples.\nFor this reason many familiar historical scenes and figures have\nbeen omitted. The continuity of a general record would be broken by\ndivergence into episodes interesting on account of their exceptional\ncharacter. Prominence has been given to domestic life, as that\nconcerns the larger number, and to those aspects of the case which have\nnot been summed up in the numerous accounts of noteworthy women.\n\nIn literature and art, which have their own special histories, where\nthe part that women have played is recounted at length, only a few\ngeneral points have been noted in order to show how women have stood\nin relation to letters and art in successive periods. The subjects\nthemselves are treated as stages marking social advance, not discussed\nin the light of their intrinsic interest and attractiveness.\n\nA consideration of the position of women in England leads, naturally,\nto the subject of their position in Europe generally, for the main\ninfluences which have affected women in this country are the same\nas those that have operated on the Continent, although the result\nhas taken different forms in accordance with the idiosyncracies of\neach nation. It is unnecessary to discuss the condition of women\nin the Eastern parts, for while Western Europe has been changing\nand progressing with ever-increasing rapidity during the last ten\ncenturies, Eastern Europe--as far as social life is concerned--remained\nfor a long period in an almost stationary state. In character it was\nAsiatic, though during the last three hundred years it has succumbed\nmore to the influences of its geographical position.\n\nIn the Middle Ages the conditions of life in Western Europe were pretty\nuniform. There was hardly any education in the sense of book-learning,\nexcept among religious communities. Locomotion was difficult and\ndangerous, so that there was but scanty intercourse between the\ninhabitants of different parts of the same country. Fighting was the\nchief business of men, and manual work, skilled and unskilled, occupied\nwomen of all ranks.\n\nIn an age when war was so frequent, the civil duties of life were left\nto women, who fulfilled obligations that in more peaceful times fell\nto the lot of men. They not only had entire charge of the household,\nbut shared largely in the operations of the field and the farm; they\nwere the spinners, the weavers, the brewsters, and the bakers. They\nfrequently controlled the management of estates, and occasionally\nheld public offices of trust and importance. There were no laws to\nprevent women from filling such positions, and the fittest came to the\nfront unhampered by conventionality or arbitrary restrictions. But\nalthough women appear to have had a wider field of activity than they\nafterwards enjoyed, when social life became more complex, there was a\ncounteracting influence which told against the development and free\nexercise of their energies. This was the influence of the Church.\n\nIt was the policy of the Church to keep women in a subordinate\nposition. As long as they remained thoroughly convinced of their\nnatural inferiority, and of the duty of subservience, they could be\nreckoned upon as valuable aids to the building up of the ecclesiastical\npower. The immense force of the religious and devotional spirit in\nwoman was at the absolute disposal of her spiritual directors. At a\ntime when there was no science, no art, and, for the majority, no\nliterature, the power of the Church was incomparably greater than\nanything we can conceive of now.\n\nThe Church did not find it difficult to persuade women to accept the\nlimits marked out for them. There was no public sentiment to set off\nagainst the power of the priest. Society was ruled by physical force;\nthe law was weak, and the Church was women’s shelter from the rudeness\nof an age when those who should have protected the defenceless were\nthemselves the greatest offenders.\n\nIn order to enforce the doctrine of inferiority, the Church went\nfurther, and proclaimed that there was in woman a wickedness additional\nto the sin common to humanity. The “eternal feminine” was held before\nmen’s eyes as a temptation to be warred against. To fly from the\npresence of woman was to resist evil. Celibacy was a saintly virtue,\nand family life a thing to be tolerated rather than approved.\nIn the words of St. Chrysostom, woman was “a necessary evil, a\nnatural temptation, a desirable calamity, a domestic peril, a deadly\nfascination, and a painted ill.” The influence of the Fathers was not\nconfined to their own age; their writings continued to affect the whole\nteaching of the Church, Anglican as well as Roman, which has always\nbeen in favour of the subordination of woman. She has been assigned\na lower place in religious exercises, and has been excluded from the\npriestly office.\n\nIn successive periods of history the Church was largely responsible\nfor the terrible persecutions inflicted upon women--and chiefly upon\nthe poorest and most helpless--on the ground of witchcraft. Once\nhaving disseminated the theory of woman’s inherent vice, it was only\na natural corollary to impute to her both the desire and the power of\nworking extraordinary mischief. The doctrine suited ages which believed\nnot only in an embodied and omnipresent Power of Evil, but also in\ncountless and multiform expressions of that power through natural\nobjects and phenomena.\n\nThe Feudal System, which prevailed in England up to the middle of\nthe fifteenth century, and in France up to a much later period, had\na repressive effect on women of the lower classes, though for women\nin the upper ranks it presented certain advantages. The women of the\nfamilies of tenants on a feudal estate were regarded as chattels which\nwent with the land. They were bound to the soil, and were fined if they\neither accepted work or married outside the lord’s domain.\n\nThe age of chivalry had a twofold effect on the position of women. It\ncreated an ideal of womanhood which stirred the imagination and the\npoetic fancy. Chivalry had its sublime side. It was a protest against\ntyranny and vice; it inspired men to heroic deeds; it gave them a\nloftier conception of duty. It was the revulsion of noble minds from\nthe coarseness, the unpitying indifference to wrong, and contempt for\nweakness, which characterized the Middle Ages. Like a new gospel,\nchivalry dawned upon a world in which the virtues of Paganism had\ndeclined, while its vices still triumphed.\n\nBut chivalry had another side. The pure reverence for woman passed\ninto romantic admiration, into a worship of physical beauty, into mere\npassion. Woman, from being little less than a saint, became a toy. The\nteaching of the Church and the spirit of chivalry both acted adversely\non the position of woman. By the one she was lowered below the level of\nhumanity, by the other she was raised to an ideal pinnacle, where it\nwas impossible she could remain. The fault was the same in both cases.\nThe priest and the knight removed woman from her natural place into a\nfalse position, endowing her with sub-human wickedness and superhuman\nexcellencies.\n\nWith the Renaissance and the spread of education, social life underwent\ngreat changes. The Church was no longer the dominant influence. Great\nsecular forces came into play; the tide of learning swept over Europe;\ncommerce, travel, discoveries, inventions, caused old habits to be\nunlearnt. Thought, which had been stagnant, was freshened into a moving\nstream. In the intellectual re-birth, in the conflict of faiths, in the\ndeadly political struggles which occupied the sixteenth and seventeenth\ncenturies in England, we see how women were passing from the narrow\nlife of the home into the wide life of the nation.\n\nThe great industrial revolution, which began in the last century, and\nhas progressed with such rapid strides, has had its special bearing\non the position of women. The material improvements brought about by\nmachinery and developing trade, have lifted the middle-class woman\nout of the purely domestic sphere by lessening her household duties,\nand so leaving her free for other occupations. She has ceased to be\na producer. But the working woman has been simply drawn more and more\nfrom family life, to be absorbed into the ranks of outside workers. She\nis, in many cases, as much detached from the home as the man, by the\nnecessity of wage-earning.\n\nThe educational revolution of modern times has also worked great\nchanges in the position of women in England. It has specially affected\nthe middle classes, who have been thereby enabled to enter with perfect\nfreedom into the world of letters, to follow professional and business\ncareers--in a word, to carve out for themselves an independent course.\nA new conception has arisen of what is woman’s place in society.\nShe now bears an active part in all the great movements--political,\nreligious, philanthropic; her co-operation is sought in public work,\nand her presence welcomed, rather than resented, in all new social\nenterprises.\n\nIn the lighter side of life--in its recreations, which are now more\nin the nature of work than play--women have a much wider field than\nformerly, and take their pleasure as best suits them, without let or\nhindrance. They are free to act according to their necessities and\ntastes, wherever common sense and fitness lead them, without finding\nthe barrier of sex laid across the path. Those who are afraid lest\nthe world should suffer by women adopting modes of life unsanctioned\nby tradition, may console themselves by remembering that Nature is\nstronger than fashion or opinion, and will at once make her voice heard\nwhenever the lightest of her laws is transgressed.\n\nThe position of women in England cannot be regarded as an orderly\nevolution. It does not show unvarying progress from age to age. In one\ndirection there has been improvement, in another deterioration. There\nhave been breaks and gaps in the general advance, so that certain\nperiods appear at a disadvantage in comparison with their predecessors.\nThe last half-century shows very rapid and momentous changes. Never\nwere such advantages placed within the reach of women; never were so\nmany opportunities--social, literary, educational, commercial--open to\nthem. But these advantages and opportunities would have been useless if\nwomen had not been ready, and shown their fitness for the new trusts.\nThey have themselves largely created the public sentiment which now so\nstrongly impels them towards wider action, and imposes on them greater\nresponsibilities.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS OF VOL.

there\nare few pictures so attractive as that of a stately manor-house in\nolden times. Its seclusion and calm, the solidity, regularity, and\nsimplicity of its daily life, are a soothing contrast to the noise and\ncomplexity of the common round in the present day. We are accustomed\nto think of the Middle Ages as a period of strife, of rude commotions,\nwith a generally unsettled state of society. It was so, but with\nit all there was a great peace which this generation knoweth not.\nFighting and brawling there was in plenty. Life was cheap, property\ninsecure; every man was his own policeman; quarrels meant blows, and\nmight was right. But the very causes which produced this state of\nsociety created also an opposite condition of things. Bad roads, lack\nof communication, which made it possible for deeds of violence to pass\nunpunished, kept the knowledge of those deeds hidden from the community\nat large. Life went on in quiet corners undisturbed by the thought of\nevil and misfortune close at hand. There was no responsive throb of\nfeeling between one town and another, no electric thrill passing from\ncountry-side to country-side. Each place lived its life comparatively\napart. To-day a touch on any of our great centres of life is felt\nthroughout the kingdom. In mediæval times England was not a whole, but\na conglomeration of communities, each with an independent existence.\n\nThe manor-house was essentially a self-contained domain. Even the best\nof country roads were so indifferent that a town a few miles off was\nnot much more than a name to most of the occupants of the manor-house.\nWhat were called high-roads were merely tracks along which waggons\nwere dragged with the utmost difficulty. The house itself, embowered\nin trees on low-lying ground or sheltering against the breast of a\nhill, was in its isolation both defenceless and secure. Generally, it\nhad a palisade or outer fence to form a protection against assault.\nThat a house of any pretensions should be something in the nature of a\nstronghold was necessary in those days.\n\nThe upper story was reserved for the lady and her maidens. It was the\npart most protected, and was sometimes strengthened further by the\nplacing of heavy doors at short intervals on the staircase which led to\nthis portion of the house. Originally consisting of only one apartment\ncalled the solar, this upper floor was gradually enlarged until it\ncomprised several sleeping-rooms, the hall becoming more and more a\nplace for dining and receiving guests and transacting business, while\nthe real family life was lived upstairs. Mediæval manners necessitated\nsome retreat where the women-folk would not be exposed to contact with\nany passing stranger who might claim hospitality. It seems, however,\nto have been customary for the lady of the house to sit with her lord,\nor, in his absence, to preside at the dinner or supper taken in the\nhall. Her place was at the upper end, away from the entrance, and only\nprivileged guests would be permitted to sit close to her. There was a\nfull acknowledgment of the wife’s social position. To women of rank\nand station the feudal system brought certain advantages. Every feudal\nlord was a kind of princeling, and his wife shared his dignities. The\nstate kept up in the feudal castle and in the mediæval manor-house\ngave the wife considerable importance. As far as social duties went,\nhusband and wife acted as partners, receiving and entertaining the\nguests together. The unsettled times, which so often kept the lord\nfrom his own roof, brought the lady into prominence as sole guardian\nof the family possessions and interests. She was hedged round with a\nlittle circle of ceremony. A great lady always had a body-guard of\nmaidens who lived under the eye of their mistress, while the lord had\na similar contingent of pages or squires. It was a general custom in\nfeudal times, and even somewhat later, for the daughters and sons of\ngood families to be sent to live in the household of some knight or\ngentleman to be instructed in all the arts pertaining to their station.\nFeudal etiquette required that a great lady should be personally served\nby ladies of rank. With this personal service was combined training in\nall domestic accomplishments which it was necessary for a well-bred\nmaiden to acquire. The English fashion of sending children from home\nwas commented on by foreigners as a proof of the lack of parental\naffection. It was a fashion that was in full vogue in the middle of the\nfifteenth century. In 1469, Dame Margaret Paston writes to her son, Sir\nJohn Paston, about his sister Margery--\n\n    “I wuld ye shuld purvey for yur suster to be with my Lady\n    of Oxford, or with my Lady of Bedford, or in sume other\n    wurchepfull place, wher as ye thynk best, and I wull help to\n    her fyndyng, for we be eyther of us werye of other.”\n\nDame Paston’s blunt letter seems to bear out the charge brought against\nEnglish parents.\n\nA knight’s lady was like the mistress of a boarding-school, and a\nvery stern mistress she often proved to be. Rank and birth did not\nexempt her pupils from strict discipline and hard work. While their\nbrothers were learning to ride and to wrestle, to shoot, and to handle\nthe battle-axe, to sing and to learn to bear themselves gallantly\nlike gentlemen, the maidens were being initiated into the mysteries\nof weaving, spinning, brewing, distilling, salting, and many other\nprocesses which were then performed by each family for itself. To\nthese occupations was added needlework of all kinds, from the making\nof plain serviceable smocks and cloaks to embroidering banners and\naltar-cloths; for all wearing apparel, as well as everything required\nfor household use, was manufactured and made up at home. If the male\nmembers of the establishment were numerous, a busy time the lady and\nher maidens must have had. Well might the poet write--\n\n  “Mult doit fame estre chier tenue\n   Par li est tout gent vestue.\n   Bien sai que fame file et œuvre\n   Les dras dont l’en se vest et cuevre\n\n  “Et toissus d’or et drap de soie\n   Et por ce dis-je où que je soie,\n   A toz cels qui orront cest conte,\n   Que de fame ne dient honte.”[1]\n\nNo doubt the coarser kinds of work, such as the clothes for dependants,\nwere given out to the servants; but every young gentlewoman had to\nlearn the process, so as to be able in her turn to superintend a\nhousehold. Tailors were also employed for the making of both women’s\nand men’s garments. In royal households there were regular tailors\nwho made feminine as well as masculine garments. A tailor was called a\ncissor. In the time of Edward I., the King, the Queen, and the Prince\nof Wales each had their separate tailors.\n\nThere were large establishments of celibate priests, like that of\nBishop Swinfield who lived in the thirteenth century, where no female\nservants were permitted to enter, and men performed all the domestic\nwork. Unless the nuns of some neighbouring convent were employed in\nworking for these semi-monastic households, there must have been a\nsupply of masculine weavers and spinners. Curiously enough, the only\nin-door employment in these priests’ houses for which female labour was\nengaged was that of brewing. The brewing was always exclusively in the\nhands of women, and it is thought possible that even in ecclesiastical\nestablishments the old custom was followed.\n\nIn the Middle Ages it was not usual for women to be employed about the\nroyal palaces except to attend on the queen and princesses. In France,\nsays Meiners, in his “History of the Female Sex”--\n\n    “When the kings lived apart from their consorts, they had in\n    their palaces no persons of the female sex, except a few of\n    those menials whose services are indispensably necessary in\n    every family, such as washerwomen, needle-women, etc., and\n    even these were removed by Philip the Fair from his court.\n    In like manner the palaces and apartments of the queens and\n    princesses were inaccessible to all persons of the other sex,\n    except the _maître de l’hotel_ and the knights or esquires who\n    mounted guard before the doors and chambers of the princesses.\n    At table, in rising and going to bed, in undressing and\n    dressing, queens and princesses were attended only by their\n    women and maids; and this ancient practice was retained by the\n    queens of France so late as the sixteenth century.”\n\nBut to return to the manor-house. A great lady, who had to superintend\nand take an active share in the _making_ only of the clothes for the\nhousehold, would in these days feel herself very hardly pressed,\nespecially if she were also expected to be her own housekeeper and see\nto the good ordering of the kitchen. But if she had also to manufacture\nmaterial and to preside over all those initial processes of which\nshe now sees nothing but the results, life would seem an intolerable\nburden. It was not so thought in mediæval times. It is true that in\nnoblemen’s houses there was a steward, whose business it was to provide\nthe household with necessaries. In the Berkeley family, which may be\ntaken as a typical case, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,\nthe steward was accustomed to order, either monthly or quarterly,\ncertain quantities of provisions to be supplied from the manors and\nfarms belonging to the estate. But the lady of the house exercised a\ngeneral superintendence. Joan, the wife of Thomas, third Lord Berkeley,\nwho lived in the reign of Edward III., is described as--\n\n    “a vertuous lady and great huswife and a wise overseer of such\n    household affayres as were proper to her sex and government....\n    When shee came to theis farm-houses (as often shee did) to\n    oversee or take accompt of her dairy affaires, shee oftentimes\n    spent in provisions at a meale there the valewe of 4_d._ and\n    4_d._ ob. [4¼_d._ about] whereof allowance was afterwards given\n    to the Accomptant before her husband’s Auditor at the end of\n    the year. And some tymes also a cheese of two pound weight was\n    at such a tyme spent by her attendants. And in such huswifely\n    courses this virtuous Lady spent a part of her aged and weake\n    yeares untill her death.”\n\nThere was a dignity attached to manual labour which is exemplified\nin the use of the word “spinster.” It was a term of which women were\nproud. We now confine it to unmarried women, but as late as the\nsixteenth century it was used by married women of the better class. A\ngentlewoman who married a man of inferior rank claimed the title of\nspinster as a sign of her good birth and gentle breeding.\n\nLife was, however, by no means all work for the ladies of the\nmanor-house. There was time and to spare for lighter employments and\ndiversions. We hear a great deal of games, especially of chess, in\nthe households of people of rank, and the number of so-called chamber\ngames shows that the ladies had many hours for recreation. There was\ndancing too, and lute-playing, and a little conning over ballads and\nromances. For although the _damoiseaux_ frequently could not sign their\nnames, and found it hard work to spell out the words of the breviary,\nthe _demoiselles_, if they were not very skilful with the quill, were\nfairly proficient in the art of reading, which was more cultivated by\nwomen than by men.\n\nIn the intervals between needlework and housewifery, there would be\nstrolling in the garden on fine days, weaving garlands of flowers--a\nfavourite mediæval pastime; and in summer weather, when the lanes were\npassable, rambles outside the domain and occasional rides. It is easy\nto understand how much more essential was the garden to the enjoyment\nof the women-folk in days when out-door exercise was comparatively\ndifficult. There would be a little visiting among the dependents in\nthe hamlet, and for the lady herself, in cold wet seasons, a great\ndispensing of herbal medicines for rheums and ague. At all times there\nwere the doles to the poor, gifts which were thought due from the\ngreat house. Religious observances occupied a portion of each day,\nthough the length and number of these depended on the character of\nthe inmates. Still, there would be certain outward forms of devotion\nto be gone through in almost all large households. Few great ladies\nwere so punctilious in their devotions as the Princess Cecil, mother\nof Edward IV., who used to rise at seven o’clock and say matins with\nher chaplain. After that she heard a low mass in her chamber. A little\nlater in the morning, when the slight breakfast had been partaken of,\nshe would go to the chapel to hear divine service and two low masses.\nShe said evensong with her chaplain, and then went again to chapel.\n\nIn ordinary households the saints’ days would be observed, the great\nfasts kept, and mass heard at regular intervals. Sometimes the abbot of\nthe neighbouring monastery would pay what might be called a pastoral\nvisit to the lord and lady of the manor, accompanied by some of his\nmonks, mounted on mules, accustomed to pace the rough or miry roads.\nBesides these clerical visitors, there would be strangers to be\nentertained every now and then, and if they were of high degree, the\nlady herself would see that their wants were supplied, and would sup\nand converse with them.\n\nLife in the mediæval manor-house, though it was a life much secluded\nfrom the noise and bustle of the world, was one full of activity and\nvaried occupation. There were so many necessary duties that must be\nperformed, that the absence of entertainment and of the pleasures of\nart and literature was not felt. The horizon was limited. Interests\nwere concentrated within a narrow compass, but what is unknown is not\nmissed. For the women the manor-house was the world. It is recorded\nas a merit on the part of Lady Joan Berkeley (mentioned above), that\nin the forty-two years of her married life she never travelled ten\nmiles from her husband’s houses in Somerset and Gloucester, “much\nless humered herselfe with the vaine delightes of London and other\ncities.” If a great lady like the wife of Thomas Lord Berkeley lived\nso circumscribed an existence, it is easy to imagine how small was\nthe circle of women of less degree. But this limited area of thought\nand activity does not seem to have been a bad nursery. Writing of the\nfifteenth century, Sir James Ramsay says--\n\n    “If we are led to form an unfavourable opinion of the male\n    aristocracy of the period, far otherwise is it with regard to\n    the ladies. Whether as wives, sisters, or daughters, their\n    letters create most favourable impressions.”\n\nIn feudal times it was not all noble ladies who could live in peace\nand seclusion in their homes, protected from strife and rude alarms.\nThe châtelaine was often called upon to take supreme command in her\nlord’s absence, and if trouble arose and the castle were attacked, the\nmistress was not only the nominal but the actual head of affairs. We do\nnot find in those days that women shut themselves up and declined to\ninterfere because they did not understand politics. On the contrary,\nthey responded to the need with alacrity. The great lady put down her\nembroidery-needle and took up the sword when danger threatened. She did\nnot fasten herself up in the solarium with her maidens, but took the\ncommand of the household.\n\nA notable heroine in the Wars of the Roses was Lady Joan Pelham, wife\nof Sir John Pelham, Constable of Pevensey Castle. In 1399 Sir John was\nin Yorkshire with Henry Duke of Lancaster, fighting against Richard\nII. Lady Joan, left in Pevensey Castle, was fiercely attacked by the\nYorkist forces from Sussex, Kent, and Surrey. The castle was in great\ndanger, and there was much difficulty also in obtaining provisions. The\nlong letter which she wrote to her husband during the siege has the\nadditional interest of being the earliest letter extant written by an\nEnglish lady.\n\n    “MY DERE LORD,\n\n    “I recommande me to yowr hie Lordesehippe wyth hert and body\n    and all my pore myght, and wyth all this I think zou, as my\n    dere Lorde, derest and best yloved off all earthlyche Lordes; I\n    say for me and thanke yhow my dere Lorde, with all thys that I\n    say before, off your comfortable lettre, that ze send me fron\n    Pownefraite that com to me on Mary Magdaleyn day; ffor by my\n    trowth I was never so gladd as when I herd by your lettre that\n    ye warr stronge ynogh wyth the grace off God for to kepe yow\n    fro the malyce of your ennemys.

As has already been noted, writing was a rare\naccomplishment up to the tenth century. At the time of the Norman\ninvasion, there were probably few laymen who could spell out a\nbreviary. Yet even under the Saxon kings, when there was such a dearth\nof knowledge among the people and a scarcity of all literature, there\nwas a thread of scholarship running through the nation among the\nMonastic Orders. Although the foundations of learning had been laid,\nthe building went on slowly. Strange as it appears, there was not only\namong men, but among women, a zest for study in the far-off days of the\nSaxon monk Aldhelm, who wrote for his female pupils his work, “De Laude\nVirginitatis.”\n\nTimes that were in most respects very unfavourable for the pursuit\nof letters produced students and scholars of no mean capacity. The\nseclusion in which monks dwelt by choice and women by necessity, gave\nopportunity for studies that would have been neglected under less\nrude conditions. Saxon ladies varied the monotony of their domestic\noccupations by the study of Latin, which they not only read, but wrote\nwith tolerable fluency.\n\nLatin was then the great vehicle of knowledge. It was the language\nof law, the medium of correspondence between scholars. Most of the\naccessible literature was in Latin. It was, therefore, to the study\nof that language above all else that students betook themselves. The\nlearned ladies of the sixteenth century had their forerunners in the\nwomen of the seventh and eighth, in the studious Abbess Eadburga and\nher pupil Leobgitha, with both of whom the celebrated St. Boniface,\ncalled the Apostle of Germany, corresponded in Latin.\n\nAt that period learning was so closely associated with religion, that\nthe Church was the nursery of scholars. The acquirements of the Saxon\nladies were due to their connection with the religious orders. It was\nin the priories and convents that the arts of reading and copying\nmanuscripts, of writing and composition were cultivated. So exclusively\nwas learning the monopoly of the Church, that in the Middle Ages\nthe study of books was but an inconsiderable part of a gentleman’s\neducation.\n\nWith women the case was somewhat different. Their enforced seclusion\nin days of rude manners led them to sedentary occupations. They were\nfrequently the only members of the family who could read with any ease.\nAs long as war was the chief business and out-door sports the chief\npastime of men, the quieter lives of the women gave them the advantage\nin point of learning.\n\nBut with the Renaissance a change crept in. The education of men began\nto improve, while that of the women was left as before. When William\nof Wykeham founded his school at Winchester in 1373, he thought only\nof boys. Henry VI. did not propose to admit girls to his foundation at\nEton. All the great schools which rose up in the sixteenth century,\nRugby, Harrow, Westminster, St. Paul’s, and the rest, were confined to\nthe male sex. The universities, though owing much to the beneficence\nof women in early times, have, until recently, not only done nothing\nfor the advancement of women’s education, but thrown stumbling-blocks\nin its way.\n\nIn education, as in everything else, the rich, of course, had the\nadvantage. Sir Nicholas Bacon, in the reign of Elizabeth, introduced\nsome reforms into the education of wards. There were--\n\n    “articles devised for the bringing up in vertue and learning\n    of the Queenes Majesties Wardes, being heires males and whose\n    landes descending in possession and coming to the Queenes\n    Majestie shall amount to the cleere yearly value of c. markes\n    or above.”\n\nGirls were put into wardship, too, but the Lord Keeper does not seem to\nhave thought any reforms were needed in their education.\n\nIt is not surprising to find that the girls of the poorer classes were\noften much neglected. A contemporary writer, speaking of the women of\nEngland, says--\n\n    “This nevertheless I utterlie mislike in the poorer sort of\n    them, for the wealthier doo sildome offend herein: that being\n    of themselves without competent wit they are so carelesse in\n    the education of their children (wherein their husbands also\n    are to be blamed) by means whereof verie manie of them neither\n    fearing God, neither regarding either manners or obedience,\n    do oftentimes come to confusion which (if anie correction or\n    discipline had beene used toward them in youth) might have\n    proved good members of their common-wealth and countrie by\n    their good service and industrie.”\n\nThe children of the poor could not have profited much by the free\neducation of the convent schools, for they began to earn their living\nas soon as they were able to use their hands. There was plenty of\n“discipline” in their bringing up, but not much regard paid to\n“manners” or learning.\n\nThe custom among the well-to-do classes of sending their children\nto live in the houses of the nobility prevailed all through the\nMiddle Ages and up to the sixteenth century. Among the laity it was a\nrecognized mode of education. The kind of training which the girls,\nunder this system, received depended on the character and acquirements\nof the lady of the house. The primary things to be learnt were good\nmanners and domestic arts. Books were very scarce, and, except in\nreligious houses, there would be few persons who could make use of\nthem. Even at the end of the fifteenth century it was unusual for a\ngentleman to be able to read and write.[2] There were, of course, the\nschools attached to monasteries and convents where all classes were\ntaught, and in good families tutors were employed for both girls\nand boys, such men as Elmer, Bishop of London, Roger Ascham, Walter\nde Biblesworth, and others notable for learning, acting in that\ncapacity in the households of the nobility. The curriculum at the\nconvents included English, Latin, music, and grammar. The majority of\nnoblemen’s and gentlemen’s daughters are said to have attended the\nconvent schools. A custom prevailed for these young gentlewomen to\nwear white veils, to distinguish them from professed nuns, who wore\nblack, which implies that all the pupils were resident in the convents.\nIt was not uncommon for the religious houses to be used as boarding\nestablishments. At some places ladies were received as inmates of a\nconventual household, bringing their own servants to attend upon them,\nand to a great extent living apart from the nuns.\n\nWith regard to women’s education, there seem to have been periods of\nenlightenment alternating with periods of darkness. In Saxon days,\nin the seventh and eighth centuries especially, the study of letters\noccupied a good deal of the attention of women. But while the Norman\nand Saxon were struggling into unity, education everywhere seems to\nhave been at a low ebb.\n\nWomen did not profit much by the literary renaissance of the age of\nChaucer. It is said that the daughters of John of Gaunt, who was\nfather to Henry IV., were the first English ladies who could write\n(the Saxon abbesses and their pupils are ignored in this statement),\nwhile the earliest letter extant written by a woman in English is said\nto have been the notable epistle, already quoted, sent by Lady Joan\nPelham in 1399 to her husband, relating her troubles during her gallant\ndefence of Pevensey Castle.[3]\n\nBy the middle of the fifteenth century, however, some improvement\nis noticeable. If writing were such a rare accomplishment as to add\nlustre to the family of John of Gaunt, the grand-daughter of that\nillustrious begetter of kings was celebrated for the keen interest she\ntook in books, and was herself an author. Margaret Beaufort, mother\nof Henry VII., was a noted woman of learning, though her interest for\nlater generations lies more in the part she played in history. She was\na woman of great intellectual ability, and had been most carefully\ntrained. Printing was then a new art, and the Countess of Richmond, to\ngive her the title by which she is best known, was a warm patroness of\nCaxton’s partner, Wynkyn de Worde, whom she appointed as her special\nprinter. The countess was a very great lady, and had her printer, her\npoet, her band of minstrels, just as she had her resident confessor and\nher domestic retinue. She ordered several works to be printed, and did\nmuch to foster a taste for literature among the ladies of the court.\n\nHer bent of mind was distinctly religious, and in her later years\nshe regulated her establishment on monastic lines, and lived a life\nof conventual strictness. In her secluded manor-house, situated in\nthe Hundred of Woking, her principal visitor was the abbot of the\nneighbouring monastery of Newark, who from time to time ambled along\nthe ill-kept road with a train of monks all mounted on mules to\nconfer with this powerful but dutiful daughter of the Church. In the\npicturesquely shaded house, which is still well preserved and retains\nmuch of its old-world air, the countess could pursue her reading and\nmeditations undisturbed, and it was probably here that she composed her\nreligious books. Her early studies enabled her to enjoy such literature\nas was accessible. She was well acquainted with Latin and French, but\nthere is no mention of Greek or Hebrew.\n\nWe must skip the two next generations, and go on to the great\ngrand-daughters of the Countess of Richmond before we find the dead\nlanguages assuming an important place in the curriculum of a woman’s\neducation. There were very few books accessible to the laity in the\ndays of Margaret of Richmond, but she lived long enough to see the\nmeans of knowledge multiplying fast, and to assist in the process.\n\nThe intellectual gifts and literary attainments of her grandson, Henry\nVIII., augured well for the progress of learning in England, and the\ncountess, who died the year that Henry was crowned, was thus spared\nthe pain of witnessing the crimes which stained his after career. The\nmental energy which characterised all the Tudors seems to have had its\nfountain-head in their distinguished ancestress, whose position exposed\nher to many trials and dangers, through which her strength of mind,\nsteadiness of purpose, and nobility of character carried her unscathed.\nSome ills might have been averted from England had Margaret Beaufort\nbeen alive during the reign of her grandson. And what a brilliant\nleader she would have made of that group of learned ladies who adorned\nthe second half of the sixteenth century!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      feudal lords--Power of the Church--Rise of commerce--Material\n      progress--End of the Feudal System.\n\n\nUntil th\n", "final_result_str": "repair", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "4fe7a245-2d35-4d1f-9cca-c1608d5ac828", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "正常的书籍小说"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "9092e6e8-3afe-4fac-b261-ea5809229813", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "need_repair", "evidence": "前置内容书籍"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "6d4d3dfc-f864-41f1-a065-72bd3753ddc6", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "1. 文章\n2 语法错误14"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "8a115d55-416a-485c-a015-53df2ca5d697", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 知识性内容\n- 段落间关联性较强"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Many who opened their lives to us in the writing of _Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys_ returned with updates and new puzzlements or concerns.\n\nWe extend thanks to Liz Perle, who heard me speak at the Town School for Boys in San Francisco and suggested I continue to talk with parents through a question-and-answer book, and to our agent, Gail Ross, for carrying the project forward. We also appreciate the efforts of Ballantine editor Joanne Wyckoff and her editorial and production staff, and the special assistance of Eileen Chetti, Sherry Laten, Leslie Kagan, and Melissa Jordan-Drummond.\n\nI would like to thank my wife, Theresa, and my children, Joanna and Will, for their love and support, and their patience with my writing _Speaking of Boys_ on our Florida vacation. Teresa thanks her husband, Steve, and her children, Aaron, Rachel, and Rebecca, for their love, support, and patience on the home front.\n\nSpeaking of boys, we offer particular thanks to the sons in our lives (Will and Aaron) for providing such a vital piece of our continuing education.\n\n# Introduction\n\nI **n** _Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys_ , my coauthor, Dan Kindlon, and I set out to break the traditional silence about boys' emotional lives and advance a more enlightened approach for raising boys to be emotionally whole, moral, and resilient young men. The tragic shootings at Columbine High School focused public attention squarely on these issues, and for more than a year since the publication of _Raising Cain_ , we have been on the road continuously, speaking to parent and teacher groups, education leaders, public policy makers, and the media across the nation about the nature and potential of boys.\n\nThe silence has certainly been broken. The level and fervor of public dialogue has been gratifying. What has impressed us the most, however, has been the freeing effect this public conversation has had on parents' willingness to seek advice about issues they face with their sons at home. Wherever we go now, and in letters from readers of _Raising Cain_ , parents are more eager than ever to share their \"boy stories,\" open up their lives, and air their concerns and questions. The hesitation that used to couch so many questions about boys is gone. What we hear now are more candid questions that reflect the great diversity of boys and boy experience-all kinds of questions about all kinds of boys. This is good.\n\nThe value in asking questions out loud is that more people can learn from them. Sometimes the answers offer new ideas or insights. Sometimes they confirm that which a parent already believed, but may have wondered about. And sometimes just hearing that other parents have the same questions can give a feeling of connection to the greater community of caring adults. As child psychologists, we, too, have learned from the questions. The more I hear, the more clearly I can see what perplexes parents and educators about boys and what we can do to help them.\n\nI was asked to write _Speaking of Boys_ , not as a textbook on boy psychology, but as an extension of the kind of relaxed discussion of boy life that typically unfolds at my public speaking engagements and in private therapy with boys and their families. While IVe answered thousands of questions in these settings, it never occurred to me to write them all down and save them, first because I was too busy listening and talking to do any writing, but also because I have the organizational skills of an average eighth-grade boy. As it turned out, there was no need for old notes.\n\nI invited Teresa Barker, a veteran journalist who collaborated as our writing partner for _Raising Cain_ , to join me on this new adventure, collecting fresh stories and questions from parents, teachers, mental health professionals, and other caring adults across the country and from all walks of life. Teresa is the mother of a son, age fourteen, and two daughters. Though not a psychologist, she has a natural gift for putting parents at ease. Many parents who have never attended a parenting talk shared their concerns and questions in personal interviews with her. Many parents who don't have access to private therapy were pleased to bring their concerns to me this way. And many people who would never ask their questions in public found a comfort level in tossing their questions into the pot anonymously and for the common good.\n\nTo keep the book a manageable length, we selected questions that best represented the concerns I hear again and again from parents and others engaged in working with boys. To share the rich diversity of life with boys, while protecting everyone's privacy, we changed names and some details in the stories. Every one of these questions reflects a true-life minidrama or sometimes the comic relief also a trademark in the life of boys. We chose not to \"clean up\" the scenarios to simplify the lives and the issues they raised. In everyday life, parents and teachers-and therapists-are asked to problem-solve with insufficient information. The process of discovery includes looking for more than one explanation and remaining open to more than one kind of response. This is the way we need to talk and think to get closer to the truth.\n\nThere was no way to rank the questions. Who's to say that a question about what makes one happy boy tick is any more important than a question about what makes another boy a walking time bomb? When questions come from a caring place, they are all equal. So we grouped the questions in categories by topic. They cover the full range of boy life, from the most serious concerns to the most humorous, and they cover all ages of boys. _Speaking of Boys_ addresses physical and emotional development, friendship, sports, money, grades, peer pressure, electronics and video games, cruelty, anger and aggression, body image, family relationships, death and illness, divorce, depression, attention disorders, dating, drugs, and college/career/talent development.\n\nAs it happens, the single most-asked question about boys comes last in the book.\n\nWhen I think of all the comments and questions I've heard, one of the most memorable is a comment-a complaint, actually-from a listener when I was a guest on the _Talk of the Nation_ program on National Public Radio. _Raising Cain_ had just been published, and the public discussion of the emotional life of boys was just beginning to heat up in the media. During the listener call-in portion of the show, a man called to say how disappointed he was in my remarks about the complexities of boy life. \"Boy psychology is so simple,\" he said, and went on to describe his own life: He'd come back from duty in the Vietnam War and it took him four or five years to get over that. He'd had a number of relationships with women that hadn't worked out, but there were no big mysteries at work there. With every example of the \"simplicity\" of male life, he was describing a life that clearly had been shaped by emotional pain and troubled relationships. And yet his response was to deny that anything was complex about the emotional lives of boys and men.\n\nBoys are not simple. We must not take them at face value. If you are reading this book, you know that already and you are looking for some help in understanding the riddles of boys' lives. My hope is that _Speaking of Boys_ will give you the experience of exploring boys' difficulties in the company of a child psychologist (and former boy) who is now the parent of a nine-year-old boy and a fifteen-year-old girl. My wish is that you find it an easy and enjoyable way to understand the baffling, painful, inspiring, and often funny lives of boys.\n\n# Speaking of  \n **the Nature of Boys**\n\n## New Mother of Baby Boy Looks to the Future\n\n**Q:** This may sound like a stupid question, but I am an expectant mother, and we know it will be a boy. I've never had any experience around little boys. I never had any brothers and my sisters never had boys. My only experience is in seeing other people's little boys, and to be honest, they look like a handful. I'm just wondering if you have some simple (so I can keep it in mind over the years!) advice for raising a son to stay out of trouble and be a good man?\n\n**MGT** : First of all, congratulations! You are in for an adventure, a learning experience, and a lot of fun. All you need is a loving heart and an open mind. As for boys being a handful, all children are a handful! I have a friend who says, \"All human beings are more or less impossible.\" I think that is true (it certainly describes me). That's why we all need families who love us. As I have traveled around the country talking to parents about boys, I have had many mothers come up to me to say, \"Take it from me, boys are easy. It is girls who are tough!\" I have had just as many mothers testify that boys are so hard to read, so competitive, so mysterious, and so cruel.\n\nWhy do some mothers find boys difficult and others find them to be a delight? Certainly, being raised with brothers or having nephews is a helpful experience, but I don't think that is the crucial element. I have known some wonderful mothers of boys who were not raised in families with brothers. To me the two things that I would wonder about in the mother of a boy are: (1) whether she likes men, and (2) whether she will be able to adapt to her baby's rhythms and temperament.\n\nIn some ways, you have to want the end product of boyhood in order to raise a son with a sense of full acceptance. He is going to turn into a man. As our son, Will, has grown up, from time to time my wife has said, \"It doesn't seem possible that he is going to grow up to be large and hairy.\" But he is, and I can see she is practicing in her mind, transforming this sweet, beautiful child into a large, bearded man and still recognizing him. Practice thinking about the man your son will become. Who have been the admirable men in your life? Did you love your father? Did your grandfather dote on you? Do you have a good relationship with your husband? Think about what you have liked in men and how you would like to see your son grow up to be like that. If you have a picture in your mind of the way you'd like him to be, it will help you to guide him.\n\nPlease don't think about boys as a problem; don't brace yourself for their energy or their competitiveness. Think about what your loving grandfather must have been like as a boy. Does your grandmother or mother have any stories about him? Ask your husband about his boyhood. What was he like? What did he do? Ask your husband enough questions so you get beyond the polished family stories about his bringing the frog to the table or throwing a football through the window. Families tend to hold on to gender-stereotyped stories that do not really illuminate the nature of the child. Ask your husband how it _really_ was for him when he was a boy. What scared him, what was he passionate about?\n\nMay I suggest that you read books about boyhood? How about _Angela's Ashes?_ You'll read it with new eyes, now that you have a son. It will teach you something about boy grief, boy endurance, and boy humor. Reread _Tom Sawyer._ Read some autobiographies of admirable men. It will be helpful to discover that Mahatma Gandhi got into fights at school or the Dalai Lama and his brother were so boisterous and competitive that his brother was sent away from the monastery.\n\nOf course, you are going to be reading books to your son at night. The books that he loves will be an education for you. He will identify with the angry Max in _Where the Wild Things Are_ , and he will admire the elephant, Horton, who steadfastly hatches the egg while balanced on that little tree, and you will both marvel at the imagination of that boy fishing in McElligot's pool. You will see your son in all of these characters, and you will be introduced to things you had never spent much time thinking about, such as what occupies a boys mind when he is fishing. Reading to children is as much an education for parents as it is for children.\n\nAs for my second point, adapting to a child's temperament, that is the crucial thing for parenting any child, boy or girl. You are going to have to get on your son's wavelength without his being able to tell you what channel he is broadcasting from. You will get that from the experience of knowing him as a baby, holding him, responding to his cries, calming him during a plane ride, and holding him back as he is about to run into the street. He will make you stretch your personality and your limits, and you will become more adaptable than you ever thought possible. That's parenting.\n\nFor a mother to raise a boy means she gets as close as one can get to crossing the lines of gender. She will see the world through her son's eyes, and the world won't look the same. Mothers get to be adored by their sons, and that is really fun. She'll get to celebrate everything she has loved in men and help her son to become a good man. She will struggle with everything she has found regrettable in men, and at moments she will despair and say, \"They're hopeless.\" It will be an amazing trip, just as it is for fathers who have daughters. Your son will open your eyes, broaden your knowledge, and help your sense of humor. I guarantee it.\n\nFor a father to raise a boy means he gets to replay the best of his own fathers fathering of him. To teach your son how to fish, if that's what your father did with you, will be intensely gratifying. Fathering children, especially boys, means that we get to take care of ourselves as well as them. It will also give a father a chance to improve on his own father's harsh or punitive fathering of him. The experience will be good for his son and healing for him. Finally, if a man has struggled inarticulately in the past to explain himself and his life in boy terms to his puzzled wife, his son will provide a walking, talking illustration. Their son will do something very \"boy\" and the dad can say, \"See! That's what I meant!\"\n\n## Bombs Away! Blocks and Barbies\n\n**Q:** We have a daughter in first grade and twin three-year-old boys. We have all kinds of toys in the playroom and we encourage everyone to play with everything-trucks, dolls, and building blocks. We've noticed that when our daughter plays with the Barbie dolls she gives them little places to live and has them cook and do things like real people might do. When the boys play with Barbie, they use her as a torpedo down the slide into the sandbox. We see the same kind of behavior in other boys-they turn everything into an action figure or a weapon. Why do boys do that?\n\n**MGT** : You have asked the central unanswerable question of psychology, what is called the \"Nature or Nurture\" question. It is also a question I am asked by parents all the time. They are so surprised by how \"boy\" their boy is and how \"girl\" their girl is. They want to know where the child's gender choices came from.\n\nIn 1952 Erik Erikson started his landmark study of child psychology, _Childhood and Society_ , with exactly the observations of children's play that you describe, namely the different ways in which boys and girls use blocks. The girls built circular, contained cities, and the boys built towers and rockets. Many scientists have studied the nature of children's play since then. Is what we see in boys and girls the result of biology or training? Is what we see in children the result of their biological wiring, their hormones, some inborn plan, or is it the result of the expectations of their parents and the thousands of messages they get from the culture about what it means to be a boy or a girl?\n\nWe know that children show signs of gender identity very early, though not quite as early as the old Mel Brooks skit about the two-hour-old baby suggested. In the skit, a miracle baby with the ability to speak (Mel Brooks) is born at the UCLA Medical Center and is hurriedly interviewed by a reporter (Carl Reiner). The baby believes he is a girl until he looks down and sees that he is swaddled in a blue blanket. \"Oh, I'm a boy,\" he shouts. \"I'm going to go to baseball games, get drunk, and throw up!\"\n\nThe humor here is just a slight exaggeration of the truth: our culture creates gender scripts for both boys and girls, and just as soon as a boy realizes what gender he is, he is inevitably going to feel inclined to play out some version of the script. Many parents play an eager supporting role by buying into the traditional \"boy theme\" colors and designs in clothes, cribs, clocks, wallpaper, blankets, and such. Others want to resist this kind of overt directing, yet will pick up their newborn son and describe him as \"strong\" and \"rugged,\" while parents of newborn girls hold them and describe them as \"beautiful\" and \"sweet.\" Even before babies are born, they are stereotyped. Mothers who know they are carrying a boy often describe the baby's kicks in the uterus as \"very strong.\" Mothers of girls don't tend to describe their girl's kicks in terms of strength. In truth, the kicks of boys in utero are no stronger than the kicks of girls. So the messages that boys receive about what they should be-very strong, for instance-begin before they are even born. Boys see thousands of messages that tell them that boys like guns, torpedoes, and action. Girls get thousands of messages that tell them that girls grow up to be women who manage homes, offices, families, and relationships. Think of how many visual reinforcing messages boys receive from their parents. If he picks up a truck, everyone smiles: he's a boy! If he were to pick up a doll, it might make everyone nervous. When you think about how much reinforcement a boy receives for acting \"like a boy\" and how much discouragement he encounters when he acts \"like a girl,\" it is not surprising that boys come to like \"boy\" things.\n\nMost parents don't experience themselves as influencing their boys to be boys or their girls to be girls. Their child's boyness or girlness seems so strong, so inevitable, that most parents experience their gender behavior as a biological imperative. I cannot tell you how many times mothers have said to me, \"I never understood about boys until I had one. They really are _boys\"_ By that they mean that biology-nature-must have something to do with these early, distinctive differences in behavior. We do know that young boys typically exhibit a higher activity level, physicality, and impulsivity than do girls. We know that boys engage in more play fighting than girls. However, it is clear that testosterone alone is not responsible for boy aggression, nor are boys condemned by their biology to be violent. There are many cultural factors that influence boy behavior along with their biology.\n\nWe do not yet have the answers about gender behavior. Unfortunately, the complexity of human beings and the limits of psychology do not allow scientists to say definitively what makes a boy want to play with boy toys. Most psychologists believe that children's choices reflect some combination of nature-genes, hormones, body, brain chemistry-and experience, including seeing what men do, seeing what their older brothers play with, and especially receiving the toys their parents give them.\n\nOne professor of psychology wrote an essay in his retirement claiming that he had decided the question of genetics vs. environment. Genetics wins, he said, at 52 percent! Life experience is responsible for 48 percent. Of course, that is a joke. No one knows exactly what percentage of boy behavior is nature and what is nurture. The safest bet is that it is a complex interaction between the two that will provide doctoral dissertation material for neurologists, psychologists, and geneticists for years to come. For parents, it means continued years of amusement as we watch our children play, and an occasional rescue mission when Barbie the bomb is needed back at the dollhouse.\n\n## Dad's Retreat from Obstinate Four-Year-Old\n\n**Q:** Sean is four years old and very, very active and sometimes also is very obstinate when it comes to cooperating about getting dressed to go places or getting into the car. The need to be constantly \"on duty\" is wearing out my husband and me, and then when Sean is difficult to deal with, my husband has no patience left. Recently he smacked Sean on the bottom-some people would call it a spank-which upset me. My husband's father was very harsh this way when my husband was a boy, and we had agreed that we wouldn't use this kind of physical discipline with Sean. Since that incident, when it's my husband's turn to get Sean dressed to go out, at the first sign of trouble he throws his hands up, leaves the room, and says he can't deal with it. That leaves me to do more and more, and I am exhausted by Sean and resentful of my husband's attitude. I've suggested we go to a parenting seminar, but my husband won't go. How can I get my husband to stop walking away at the first sign of trouble but control his temper so he doesn't hit Sean?\n\n**MGT** : One of the difficulties men face when they become fathers-no matter what kind of discipline they experienced in their families-is that they have not had enough practice dealing with the activity level and willfulness of small children. Most women have had some experience as baby-sitters; most women took a more active role in raising their younger brothers and sisters when they were young. Women tend to have a larger repertoire of strategies for dealing with the stubborn defiance of small children. Men are often surprised by how helpless they can be made to feel, and they are humiliated by how angry they become at a four-year-old.\n\nPeople often believe that men are without compassion or do not want to deal with problems, when, in fact, a man is struggling to manage his own internal level of distress. Research has shown that boys respond just as strongly as girls to a crying baby-their heart rate and skin response are often more aroused than that of girls-but they do not have the experience in calming babies and so they remain in a more overwhelmed state longer than girls do. They don't have self-confidence that they can handle the situation.\n\nThe best part of what your husband is doing (and I hear that you do appreciate this) is that he is separating himself from your son so that he doesn't spank him. If he spanks, he is going to feel ashamed of himself and a failure in front of you. You should let him know that you respect and appreciate that he is trying not to hurt his son. You should let him know that you, too, feel like hitting your son sometimes. You should let him know that you feel stressed out by your son. It will help him to know that even though you do a more effective job with your son, you struggle, too. Your husband may have turned you into a bit of a saint in his mind and that's a problem. (Despite our respect for saints, no one wants to be married to one because the unsaintly one constantly feels inadequate by comparison.) You are resenting his abandonment of you; he may be resenting your competence in comparison to him. This is how children can stress their parents' marriage. It would help the two of you if you could both acknowledge how lonely, how scary, and how difficult parenting can be and let one another know that you both need help. You need relief; he needs strategies.\n\nHow do you help him develop the skills he needs to help you? He has rejected the idea of a parenting class. That's understandable. He does not want to be humiliated in front of strangers either, and he cannot imagine that a class could make him feel better. Why don't you take the class alone and leave your husband home to put your son to bed? I'm only half joking. If your husband handles bedtime all right with your son, this might give them some needed time to enjoy each other without the stress of deadline departures. Do you have friends with a seven-year-old version of your son? Why don't you get together for dinner and ask them how they managed? It will be a great relief to your husband to hear that someone else's marriage was put under stress by a small child. They may also have some practical suggestions for you. Even if they don't, it will make you and your husband feel closer to see that others survived.\n\nIt sounds to me as if you have some good strategies already in place when you work with your son, but that your feeling of not being supported is contributing to your sense of exhaustion. Enlist your husband as a partner and help educate him by reviewing with him how you handled issues with your son during the day. This not only welcomes him as a consultant but also helps him understand all the steps in responding responsibly to your son. If you find you need specific suggestions, begin by briefing him about what went wrong with your son in the morning. Very often, going back over the events together can illuminate where the glitches were and what might be done about them. If you cannot come up with some creative solutions together, reading some practical books that deal specifically with how to avoid power struggles with stubborn children or children with high activity levels might help. Ask other parents for tips on dealing with obstinate behavior and getting a child dressed in the morning. Take some notes and share them with your husband. Ask him which ones he thinks would be effective. Then split the work of getting your son dressed, and each take the parts that you think you can do most effectively. Develop a tag-team or hand-off system, so that you can give your son to your husband when you feel resentful and he can give his son back to you when he feels overwhelmed. I would bet that when your son experiences the two of you as working together, he will much more easily give up his oppositional behavior.\n\nIn the early evening, when you both still have some energy, debrief each other about the morning battle. Share your impressions. Try to laugh about it when you can. Isn't it amazing and ridiculous that children can make us feel so powerless?\n\n## Preening at Thirteen\n\n**Q:** Our son is thirteen and has always been an attractive enough boy but never did seem to care a lot about his appearance. Suddenly, he is living in the shower and has become very meticulous about his hair before he goes out to school or even to the grocery store. What is the thing with all the showers and why this sudden urge to preen?\n\n**MGT** : A boy's wish to shower, put on deodorant, stare in the mirror, and run a comb through his hair is an unmistakable sign that he has discovered a new sense of pleasure and pride in his body. For most boys, it suggests that they've come to realize that girls care about the way boys look, and it is ironclad evidence that a boy is interested in girls and their looks, their hair, and the way they smell.\n\nA frequent complaint of mothers of boys under the age of eleven is that they are messy, don't like to take baths, wear torn clothes, put on clothes that don't match, and are willing to wear the same pair of underpants for days on end. (This is not true of all boys, of course; nothing is true of all boys, but it may be true of a majority.) You'd think, given these complaints, that mothers would rejoice when their sons begin showering two and three times a day, wearing deodorant, and combing their hair. More often, mothers and fathers get a bit annoyed about it.\n\nFirst of all, parents get upset because the behavior is so obviously self-absorbed. Indeed, the act of running a comb repeatedly through your hair in front of other people is almost the definition of self-centeredness. (Remember Kookie on _77 Sunset Strip?)_ For those of us adults who have gradually given up thinking we are the center of the universe, it is disconcerting to see our children suddenly think that they are the center of the universe. Can't we pass down our hard-won discovery of humility to them? We try. As one exasperated mother said to her thirteen-year-old son, \"One billion Chinese people do not go to bed at night with your name on their lips!\"-an example of adult sarcasm that was undoubtedly lost on her son. We can try, but we can't crack our children's egocentrism in the years from thirteen to fifteen. Their self-absorption and egocentrism are impregnable. What does break it down? Life does it. The teasing of other kids does it. A girl may do that by dismissing your son, by telling him he isn't as handsome or as cool as he thinks. And then you'll want to scream at her, \"Don't you hurt my son. He's a wonderful boy.\"\n\nThe second thing that bothers parents about a son's sudden self-absorption is that it slows things down. He stays in the shower too long, he'd rather comb his hair than pull his schoolbooks together in the morning, etc. That's annoying to an adult who is trying to get everyone in the family moving toward the car and school and tasks and lessons. And it makes you want to shout, \"All the combing isn't making very much difference. You're still a kid, you're still a wonderfully handsome and funny-looking thirteen-year-old. Nothing but time-a couple of years of growth-is going to change that, so let's get in the car and go to school!\"\n\nThird and most profoundly, our children's interest in their appearance tells us that they are becoming sexual beings, and that involves a sense of loss for parents. His combing his hair means he is thinking of himself as someone who might be attractive to a girl. And a boy's sexual interest in girls means that his loving bond with his mother, though it may be strong throughout his life, is not going to be as exciting as what he is going to feel about another girl in the next few years. That can hurt a mother's feelings. She may feel she has become the old love, now discarded. It can hurt a fathers feelings, too, when his son would rather talk with a girl on the phone than go to a boat show with his father, the way they did when he was ten. When he was ten, being with his dad was real exciting, and his love for his mom was huge. It is hard for parents to give up the feeling of being the central love in their child's life. That's the parental side of the old Oedipus complex. You see, it is not just boys who love their moms; moms love their boys, too. They love them a lot, but they know that all that hair combing isn't for them; it is for someone else.\n\nJust thinking of a son as having a sexual life, which includes masturbation, fantasy, and eventually sexual intercourse, is more than most of us want to think about when we're waiting impatiently for our turn in the family bathroom. But that's what's behind this preening, and that's why it drives parents nuts.\n\n## Chin Hairs and a Boy's Pride\n\n**Q:** BJ is sixteen, and in the past few months several hairs have begun to grow from his chin-like a beard, only just about five hairs. I've encouraged him to shave them off because they look odd, but he just leaves them there. His dad just shrugs and laughs at it. BJ's so sensitive about how he looks in other ways, I'd think he'd want to shave this little spot. But he doesn't. Am I missing something? Is there something \"sacred\" about these few hairs?\n\n**MGT** : Of course there is something sacred about his five hairs. That's 500 percent more hair on his face than he had two years ago. He's a man now, with a man's body. And the hair on his chin is evidence of it. He's also advertising, symbolically; he's letting people know that he has hair on other places on his body as well. His father understands that and that's why he just shrugs and laughs. He doesn't want to have to explain to you how important pubic hair can be to a boy. Boys on athletic teams shower with other boys. It matters to them to look masculine because they are going to be naked in \"public.\" I know a twelve-year-old boy who was just starting puberty and came out of the bathroom at home and announced to his mother that he had \"eleven pubic hairs.\" He'd counted them. He was very proud. She hardly knew what to say. What's the right response in that situation? How about \"That's wonderful, son! Keep it up!\" or \"I'm so proud of you!\" Probably a wise smile and accepting nod is the best way to go.\n\nFascination with these physical changes is not just a boy thing. Don't girls between the ages of eleven and fifteen pay attention to their breast size? Don't they study their changing figure in the mirror? Don't they think a lot about bras and buying them? I know they do. I'm the parent of a teenage daughter. Girl friends that age spend an enormous amount of time discussing clothes, changing clothes, trading clothes, and then coming downstairs to say, \"How does this look?\" They rotate on their feet like professional models, showing you the front and the back and the front again, just in case you missed seeing how different their bodies are than they were three or four years ago. And it is not just the clothes. Sometimes the clothes are odd or ugly to a father's eyes, just like the five hairs on a son's chin, but the girls need the acknowledgment that they have changed, that they are growing.\n\nRelax and enjoy your son. Don't worry about the hairs looking odd. They're less odd than a nose ring or an eyebrow ring. (With sixteen-year-old children it is always important to be grateful for what they are not doing.) The moment a girl at school in whom he is interested says, \"Why do you have those? I think you'd look better without them,\" they will disappear in the flash of a razor.\n\n## \"In Your Face\" Boy Arrosance\n\n**Q:** What makes boys so arrogant? I am the mother of four children-boys and girls all in their teens now-and although I know these children and their friends are \"good kids,\" I also have noticed that boys, no matter what age they are, have an arrogance about them that I just don't see in most girls. The young ones say and do immature things they know offend other people, and the older ones do things that can actually be dangerous or intimidating to other people. They stroll across the street in front of traffic, shout at each other using R-rated language or worse-even when they're friends-or refuse to do things when they're asked, in much more defiant ways than girls. Why do they impose on other people this way?\n\n**MGT** : Some people play piano. Some people sing. Some people act. In the boy realm, arrogance is a performance art. It communicates a feeling, and part of its allure is the reaction it receives from the audience-it makes people stop and take notice.\n\nThere are five explanations for boy \"arrogance.\" I will list the reasons and then I will explain each one. First, some of these displays of arrogance may have biological roots in primate dominance displays. Second, it _is_ part of their adolescent separation from adults. Third, it is immaturity dressed up to look intimidating. Fourth, it is the end result of powerful social modeling which boys receive. Fifth, in some sense arrogance works. It succeeds in confusing and sometimes frightening adult women and girls, especially because it breaks so many of their social rules.\n\nWhen you see little boys or teenage boys strut their stuff, it is almost impossible not to think that there are biological roots to such behavior. It may be that such boy behavior is linked to primate sexual displays or intimidation behaviors. It is not unusual to see a football player make a tackle and then get up and beat his own chest like a gorilla. When I drive past Cambridge Rindge and Latin School on my way to my office, boys often cross the street in front of my car and slow it down in a deliberate, challenging way Their body posture has aspects of biological display to it. I am crossing their \"territory\" and they let me know it.\n\nThat said, it is always hard to know what is biological in humans because boys see so many models of arrogant behavior that they learn to imitate. Have you ever watched the World Wrestling Federation, which so many boys watch? All the wrestlers come into the ring swaggering and acting arrogant. What about Muhammad Ali's prefight performances, sticking his face in the camera and shouting, \"I am the greatest!\" Just look at the sports and media models that are offered to boys. How could boys not learn to act in the same arrogant fashion? We imitate what we see famous people do.\n\nAdolescent boys not only need to show off their new, muscular bodies, but they also want to flaunt their autonomy and their expanded sense of self. \"Watch out, world, here we come!\" is often the teenage message, from both boys and girls. Girls are generally more keenly aware of their relational bond to others and are more likely to act in a nonthreatening way. Boys are much less inhibited about their competitiveness, and so they thrust themselves forward in loud and obnoxious ways.\n\nThough boys are competitive and full of bravado, they are also likely to be developmentally immature, especially in comparison to girls of the same age. In my experience, boys often cover up social anxiety and ignorance with arrogant displays. If a boy is afraid of the unit that they are beginning in third grade, he is likely to say, \"I hate this class!\" Or, \"I hate Ms. Jones, she's a terrible teacher.\" If a tenth-grade class is about to have a serious discussion with the psychologist, some boy will make an offensive comment about what a pointless waste of time it is going to be. If you work with adolescent boys, it is important to understand that they appear arrogant when they are afraid.\n\nFinally, boys find that acting arrogant is a source of power. Adults on a subway move away from a bunch of macho boys. Teachers become rigid and punitive when challenged by an arrogant boy; too many back down subtly when challenged in front of the class. Mothers can become frightened and overwhelmed; fathers sometimes feel challenged and retaliate physically. In whatever way, adults change their behavior when a boy acts in an arrogant way, and that tells the boy he is powerful.\n\nA star athlete was once sent to me for therapy by his coach, after an angry outburst at a referee. He started out the session with me by literally shouting in my face, \"This is the wrong way to go about helping me!\" \"Oh,\" I said, as calmly as I could, \"why do you say that?\" He continued to lead with his anger until I had involved his frightened parents and some crucial members of the faculty in seeing behind his anger at the loneliness that afflicted him. Many high-achieving boys, particularly athletes, are so respected by the adult community that everyone assumes that everything is all right inside them. Sometimes its not, but they don't know how to say so except by being angry. At some point in the next few months he accepted that the adults in his life were worried about him and were not going to go away, and he began to soften and ultimately to open up.\n\nA wise psychoanalyst once explained a patient's behavior to me by saying, \"Anger is a young man's game.\" I try to remember that it is a game. I believe that the only way to deal with boy arrogance is to disarm it. Don't rise to the bait, don't lecture and moralize, don't become frightened, and don't patronize. These are boys, here: young, dependent, and sometimes immature boys. Don't be too impressed or upset.\n\n## Is Annoying Nine-Year-Old Asking to Be Hit?\n\n**Q:** The other day I was in the den watching TV and my nine-year-old son was running around and yelling and jumping on the furniture. I asked him several times to stop and he didn't stop, so I shouted at him, but he kept it up. Finally I hit him and he stopped. It seems to be the only thing that works. Sometimes a boy is just plain asking to be hit, isn't he?\n\n**MGT** : No boy that age ever asks to be hit. I don't believe that a boy of any age wants to be struck by a parent, unless it is a teenager who wants to discover whether he is actually as strong as his father (I will discuss that at the end of my answer). A boy might, through his actions, ask to be contained, restrained, held, or settled down. His running into the street can demonstrate that he is reckless and needs to be closely monitored. A boy might show you, by throwing snowballs wildly or losing control with his brother, that he cannot manage his own excitement at that moment. But the instant you hit a boy, you will see immediately that that was not what he was looking for. He will be frightened, hurt, and confused, and he will look at you with hatred. Your hitting him might make him stop jumping on the couch, but if you hit your son, the two of you are headed down a sad road.\n\nIf you hit your son, especially if you have hit him regularly, you have put yourself in a position where you are likely going to hit him again, because he won't really believe that your words mean anything until you back them up with something physical. By hitting, you create a physical standard for \"I really mean what I'm saying.\" Once you have established the precedent of hitting, then your words _don't_ really mean what you say. You only really mean it if you are willing to hit. All children, and boys in particular, push the envelope with their parents to discover the true limits of parental authority. Once you start to hit children, your words are devalued, and you will have created a \"communication style\" based on hitting.\n\nFurthermore, hitting boys undermines the development of conscience and moral maturity. Consider this paradox: we punish boys much more harshly than we do girls, and yet they grow up to commit far more crimes than girls. By any measure, boys are our moral failures. Why? You can either blame their biology, which takes adults off the hook, or you can look more closely at what adults are doing wrong.\n\nResearch shows us that when children are physically punished, or harshly criticized, they only have a memory of how angry the adult was or how hard they were struck. They don't remember the content of the lesson. They learn to fear and to become resentful, rather than learning morals. I cannot tell you how many boys I have seen in therapy who say about their fathers, \"He's always yelling at me.\" They never say-and no longer care-what the lesson is supposed to be about. All they retain is the image of a red-faced, angry father. And they mentally write him off.\n\nIn therapy, boys can always recall incidents of being hit. I wish you could be there with me in my office, because you can see in their faces that they experience their fathers as _losing_ their moral authority when they resort to physical punishment. They often say, \"He's an asshole... he's a jerk... he doesn't know anything, he just hits me.\" If a boy has been struck often, he often looks defeated and angry himself; at the same time, he has a tough choice to make about whether or not to discuss the punishment with me. If he has been bruised, or struck regularly, or really beaten-if I have any reason to believe that a child has suffered psychological or physical harm-I must report the parent to the state's child protective services. In all fifty states, teachers and mental health professionals are mandated reporters of child abuse. Why? Because the overwhelming conclusion of research on hitting children is that it is harmful to them. The state has stepped in to protect children from their own families because the long-term effects are so injurious.\n\nYou need to know that one of the long-term effects of being hit is that it lays the foundation for a boy to become a domestic batterer. A colleague of mine who runs groups for men who abuse their wives says that you never get an adult batterer who was not himself hit as a child. Boys learn to do what their fathers show them to do. If you model physical punishment as a way to solve problems, he will think that it is masculine and will take that identification into adulthood with him. The research tells us that the most aggressive boys in kindergarten are boys who are hi\n", "final_result_str": "repair", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "29e9050f-ecd6-496c-8f99-c9585ce57353", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "1. 书籍"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "cbe8d7bd-5466-4a66-8b58-d86f9add167d", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "正常的书籍小说"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "be991a9c-17a7-42aa-ac11-be3129eeefae", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "need_repair", "evidence": "前置内容书籍"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "d56d5e88-3390-4e01-b0f8-c7f6495a17b2", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 知识性内容\n- 逻辑：连贯"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

In this regard, a conventional design solution for antenna placement involves forming small size radio frequency (RF) apertures that are typically filled with plastic in a metallic uni-body.\n\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "e3639ab2-eb33-4e4c-9471-1df26d3ad19b", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "知识性内容：涉及射频电路知识"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "fbe01463-fb95-49d1-b3d1-27203d2917fc", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "有逻辑性的内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "134b7c5a-47fb-4014-a636-b2ff4d1d44a2", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "1 语句通顺，主题明确\n2 语法错误少，2个"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "23f8c0b2-9f25-4a58-9638-6a0b2c3c188c", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 陈述事实"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Were it merely a matter of history there could be no doubts about the period; but where magic is concerned, to however slight an extent, there must always be some element of mystery, arising partly out of ignorance and partly from the compulsion of those oaths by which magic protects its precincts from the tiptoe of curiosity.\n\nMoreover, magic, even in small quantities, appears to affect time, much as acids affect some metals, curiously changing its substance, until dates seem to melt into a mercurial form that renders them elusive even to the eye of the most watchful historian.\n\nIt is the magic appearing in Chronicles III and IV that has gravely affected the date, so that all I can tell the reader with certainty of the period is that it fell in the later years of the Golden Age in Spain.\n\n# The First Chronicle - How He Met and Said Farewell to Mine Host of the Dragon and Knight\n\n## *\n\nBeing convinced that his end was nearly come, and having lived long on earth (and all those years in Spain, in the golden time), the Lord of the Valleys of Arguento Harez, whose heights see not Valladolid, called for his eldest son. And so he addressed him when he was come to his chamber, dim with its strange red hangings and august with the splendour of Spain: \"O eldest son of mine, your younger brother being dull and clever, on whom those traits that women love have not been bestowed by God; and know my eldest son that here on earth, and for ought I know Hereafter, but certainly here on earth, these women be the arbiters of all things; and how this be so God knoweth only, for they are vain and variable, yet it is surely so: your younger brother then not having been given those ways that women prize, and God knows why they prize them for they are vain ways that I have in my mind and that won me the Valleys of Arguento Harez, from whose heights Angelico swore he saw Valladolid once, and that won me moreover also ... but that is long ago and is all gone now ... ah well, well ... what was I saying?\" And being reminded of his discourse, the old lord continued, saying, \"For himself he will win nothing, and therefore I will leave him these my valleys, for not unlikely it was for some sin of mine that his spirit was visited with dullness, as Holy Writ sets forth, the sins of the fathers being visited on the children; and thus I make him amends. But to you I leave my long, most flexible, ancient Castilian blade, which infidels dreaded if old songs be true. Merry and lithe it is, and its true temper singeth when it meets another blade as two friends sing when met after many years. It is most subtle, nimble and exultant; and what it will not win for you in the wars, that shall be won for you by your mandolin, for you have a way with it that goes well with the old airs of Spain. And choose, my son, rather a moonlight night when you sing under those curved balconies that I knew, ah me, so well; for there is much advantage in the moon. In the first place maidens see in the light of the moon, especially in the Spring, more romance than you might credit, for it adds for them a mystery to the darkness which the night has not when it is merely black. And if any statue should gleam on the grass near by, or if the magnolia be in blossom, or even the nightingale singing, or if anything be beautiful in the night, in any of these things also there is advantage; for a maiden will attribute to her lover all manner of things that are not his at all, but are only outpourings from the hand of God. There is this advantage also in the moon, that, if interrupters come, the moonlight is better suited to the play of a blade than the mere darkness of night; indeed but the merry play of my sword in the moonlight was often a joy to see, it so flashed, so danced, so sparkled. In the moonlight also one makes no unworthy stroke, but hath scope for those fair passes that Sevastiani taught, which were long ago the wonder of Madrid.\"\n\nThe old lord paused, and breathed for a little space, as it were gathering breath for his last words to his son. He breathed deliberately, then spoke again. \"I leave you,\" he said, \"well content that you have the two accomplishments, my son, that are most needful in a Christian man, skill with the sword and a way with the mandolin. There be other arts indeed among the heathen, for the world is wide and hath full many customs, but these two alone are needful.\" And then with that grand manner that they had at that time in Spain, although his strength was failing, he gave to his eldest son his Castilian sword. He lay back then in the huge, carved, canopied bed; his eyes closed, the red silk curtains rustled, and there was no sound of his breathing. But the old lord's spirit, whatever journey it purposed, lingered yet in its ancient habitation, and his voice came again, but feebly now and rambling; he muttered awhile of gardens, such gardens no doubt as the hidalgos guarded in that fertile region of sunshine in the proudest period of Spain; he would have known no others. So for awhile his memory seemed to stray, half blind among those perfumed earthly wonders; perhaps among these memories his spirit halted, and tarried those last few moments, mistaking those Spanish gardens, remembered by moonlight in Spring, for the other end of his journey, the glades of Paradise. However it be, it tarried. These rambling memories ceased and silence fell again, with scarcely the sound of breathing. Then gathering up his strength for the last time and looking at his son, \"The sword to the wars,\" he said. \"The mandolin to the balconies.\" With that he fell back dead.\n\nNow there were no wars at that time so far as was known in Spain, but that old lord's eldest son, regarding those last words of his father as a commandment, determined then and there in that dim, vast chamber to gird his legacy to him and seek for the wars, wherever the wars might be, so soon as the obsequies of the sepulture were ended. And of those obsequies I tell not here, for they are fully told in the Black Books of Spain, and the deeds of that old lord's youth are told in the Golden Stories. The Book of Maidens mentions him, and again we read of him in Gardens of Spain. I take my leave of him, happy, I trust, in Paradise, for he had himself the accomplishments that he held needful in a Christian, skill with the sword and a way with the mandolin; and if there be some harder, better way to salvation than to follow that which we believe to be good, then are we all damned. So he was buried, and his eldest son fared forth with his legacy dangling from his girdle in its long, straight, lovely scabbard, blue velvet, with emeralds on it, fared forth on foot along a road of Spain. And though the road turned left and right and sometimes nearly ceased, as though to let the small wild flowers grow, out of sheer good will such as some roads never have; though it ran west and east and sometimes south, yet in the main it ran northward, though wandered is a better word than ran, and the Lord of the Valleys of Arguento Harez who owned no valleys, or anything but a sword, kept company with it looking for the wars. Upon his back he had slung his mandolin. Now the time of the year was Spring, not Spring as we know it in England, for it was but early March, but it was the time when Spring coming up out of Africa, or unknown lands to the south, first touches Spain, and multitudes of anemones come forth at her feet.\n\nThence she comes north to our islands, no less wonderful in our woods than in Andalusian valleys, fresh as a new song, fabulous as a rune, but a little pale through travel, so that our flowers do not quite flare forth with all the myriad blaze of the flowers of Spain.\n\nAnd all the way as he went the young man looked at the flame of those southern flowers, flashing on either side of him all the way, as though the rainbow had been broken in Heaven and its fragments fallen on Spain. All the way as he went he gazed at those flowers, the first anemones of the year; and long after, whenever he sang to old airs of Spain, he thought of Spain as it appeared that day in all the wonder of Spring; the memory lent a beauty to his voice and a wistfulness to his eyes that accorded not ill with the theme of the songs he sang, and were more than once to melt proud hearts deemed cold. And so gazing he came to a town that stood on a hill, before he was yet tired, though he had done nigh twenty of those flowery miles of Spain; and since it was evening and the light was fading away, he went to an inn and drew his sword in the twilight and knocked with the hilt of it on the oaken door. The name of it was the Inn of the Dragon and Knight. A light was lit in one of the upper windows, the darkness seemed to deepen at that moment, a step was heard coming heavily down a stairway; and having named the inn to you, gentle reader, it is time for me to name the young man also, the landless lord of the Valleys of Arguento Harez, as the step comes slowly down the inner stairway, as the gloaming darkens over the first house in which he has ever sought shelter so far from his father's valleys, as he stands upon the threshold of romance. He was named Rodriguez Trinidad Fernandez, Concepcion Henrique Maria; but we shall briefly name him Rodriguez in this story; you and I, reader, will know whom we mean; there is no need therefore to give him his full names, unless I do it here and there to remind you.\n\nThe steps came thumping on down the inner stairway, different windows took the light of the candle, and none other shone in the house; it was clear that it was moving with the steps all down that echoing stairway. The sound of the steps ceased to reverberate upon the wood, and now they slowly moved over stone flags; Rodriguez now heard breathing, one breath with every step, and at length the sound of bolts and chains undone and the breathing now very close. The door was opened swiftly; a man with mean eyes, and expression devoted to evil, stood watching him for an instant; then the door slammed to again, the bolts were heard going back again to their places, the steps and the breathing moved away over the stone floor, and the inner stairway began again to echo.\n\n\"If the wars are here,\" said Rodriguez to himself and his sword, \"good, and I sleep under the stars.\" And he listened in the street for the sound of war and, hearing none, continued his discourse. \"But if I have not come as yet to the wars I sleep beneath a roof.\"\n\nFor the second time therefore he drew his sword, and began to strike methodically at the door, noting the grain in the wood and hitting where it was softest. Scarcely had he got a good strip of the oak to look like coming away, when the steps once more descended the wooden stair and came lumbering over the stones; both the steps and the breathing were quicker, for mine host of the Dragon and Knight was hurrying to save his door.\n\nWhen he heard the sound of the bolts and chains again Rodriguez ceased to beat upon the door: once more it opened swiftly, and he saw mine host before him, eyeing him with those bad eyes; of too much girth, you might have said, to be nimble, yet somehow suggesting to the swift intuition of youth, as Rodriguez looked at him standing upon his door-step, the spirit and shape of a spider, who despite her ungainly build is agile enough in her way.\n\nMine host said nothing; and Rodriguez, who seldom concerned himself with the past, holding that the future is all we can order the scheme of (and maybe even here he was wrong), made no mention of bolts or door and merely demanded a bed for himself for the night.\n\nMine host rubbed his chin; he had neither beard nor moustache but wore hideous whiskers; he rubbed it thoughtfully and looked at Rodriguez. Yes, he said, he could have a bed for the night. No more words he said, but turned and led the way; while Rodriguez, who could sing to the mandolin, wasted none of his words on this discourteous object. They ascended the short oak stairway down which mine host had come, the great timbers of which were gnawed by a myriad rats, and they went by passages with the light of one candle into the interior of the inn, which went back farther from the street than the young man had supposed; indeed he perceived when they came to the great corridor at the end of which was his appointed chamber, that here was no ordinary inn, as it had appeared from outside, but that it penetrated into the fastness of some great family of former times which had fallen on evil days. The vast size of it, the noble design where the rats had spared the carving, what the moths had left of the tapestries, all testified to that; and, as for the evil days, they hung about the place, evident even by the light of one candle guttering with every draught that blew from the haunts of the rats, an inseparable heirloom for all who disturbed those corridors.\n\nAnd so they came to the chamber.\n\nMine host entered, bowed without grace in the doorway, and extended his left hand, pointing into the room. The draughts that blew from the rat-holes in the wainscot, or the mere action of entering, beat down the flame of the squat, guttering candle so that the chamber remained dim for a moment, in spite of the candle, as would naturally be the case. Yet the impression made upon Rodriguez was as of some old darkness that had been long undisturbed and that yielded reluctantly to that candle's intrusion, a darkness that properly became the place and was a part of it and had long been so, in the face of which the candle appeared an ephemeral thing devoid of grace or dignity or tradition. And indeed there was room for darkness in that chamber, for the walls went up and up into such an altitude that you could scarcely see the ceiling, at which mine host's eyes glanced, and Rodriguez followed his look.\n\nHe accepted his accommodation with a nod; as indeed he would have accepted any room in that inn, for the young are swift judges of character, and one who had accepted such a host was unlikely to find fault with rats or the profusion of giant cobwebs, dark with the dust of years, that added so much to the dimness of that sinister inn. They turned now and went back, in the wake of that guttering candle, till they came again to the humbler part of the building. Here mine host, pushing open a door of blackened oak, indicated his dining-chamber. There a long table stood, and on it parts of the head and hams of a boar; and at the far end of the table a plump and sturdy man was seated in shirt-sleeves feasting himself on the boar's meat. He leaped up at once from his chair as soon as his master entered, for he was the servant at the Dragon and Knight; mine host may have said much to him with a flash of his eyes, but he said no more with his tongue than the one word, \"Dog\": he then bowed himself out, leaving Rodriguez to take the only chair and to be waited upon by its recent possessor. The boar's meat was cold and gnarled, another piece of meat stood on a plate on a shelf and a loaf of bread near by, but the rats had had most of the bread: Rodriguez demanded what the meat was. \"Unicorn's tongue,\" said the servant, and Rodriguez bade him set the dish before him, and he set to well content, though I fear the unicorn's tongue was only horse: it was a credulous age, as all ages are. At the same time he pointed to a three-legged stool that he perceived in a corner of the room, then to the table, then to the boar's meat, and lastly at the servant, who perceived that he was permitted to return to his feast, to which he ran with alacrity. \"Your name?\" said Rodriguez as soon as both were eating. \"Morano,\" replied the servant, though it must not be supposed that when answering Rodriguez he spoke as curtly as this; I merely give the reader the gist of his answer, for he added Spanish words that correspond in our depraved and decadent language of to-day to such words as \"top dog,\" \"nut\" and \"boss,\" so that his speech had a certain grace about it in that far-away time in Spain.\n\nI have said that Rodriguez seldom concerned himself with the past, but considered chiefly the future: it was of the future that he was thinking now as he asked Morano this question:\n\n\"Why did my worthy and entirely excellent host shut his door in my face?\"\n\n\"Did he so?\" said Morano.\n\n\"He then bolted it and found it necessary to put the chains back, doubtless for some good reason.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Morano thoughtfully, and looking at Rodriguez, \"and so he might. He must have liked you.\"\n\nVerily Rodriguez was just the young man to send out with a sword and a mandolin into the wide world, for he had much shrewd sense. He never pressed a point, but when something had been said that might mean much he preferred to store it, as it were, in his mind and pass on to other things, somewhat as one might kill game and pass on and kill more and bring it all home, while a savage would cook the first kill where it fell and eat it on the spot. Pardon me, reader, but at Morano's remark you may perhaps have exclaimed, \"That is not the way to treat one you like.\" Not so did Rodriguez. His attention passed on to notice Morano's rings which he wore in great profusion upon his little fingers; they were gold and of exquisite work and had once held precious stones, as large gaps testified; in these days they would have been priceless, but in an age when workers only worked at arts that they understood, and then worked for the joy of it, before the word artistic became ridiculous, exquisite work went without saying; and as the rings were slender they were of little value. Rodriguez made no comment upon the rings; it was enough for him to have noticed them. He merely noted that they were not ladies' rings, for no lady's ring would have fitted on to any one of those fingers: the rings therefore of gallants: and not given to Morano by their owners, for whoever wore precious stone needed a ring to wear it in, and rings did not wear out like hose, which a gallant might give to a servant. Nor, thought he, had Morano stolen them, for whoever stole them would keep them whole, or part with them whole and get a better price. Besides Morano had an honest face, or a face at least that seemed honest in such an inn: and while these thoughts were passing through his mind Morano spoke again: \"Good hams,\" said Morano. He had already eaten one and was starting upon the next. Perhaps he spoke out of gratitude for the honour and physical advantage of being permitted to sit there and eat those hams, perhaps tentatively, to find out whether he might consume the second, perhaps merely to start a conversation, being attracted by the honest looks of Rodriguez.\n\n\"You are hungry,\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Praise God I am always hungry,\" answered Morano. \"If I were not hungry I should starve.\"\n\n\"Is it so?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"You see,\" said Morano, \"the manner of it is this: my master gives me no food, and it is only when I am hungry that I dare to rob him by breaking in, as you saw me, upon his viands; were I not hungry I should not dare to do so, and so ...\" He made a sad and expressive movement with both his hands suggestive of autumn leaves blown hence to die.\n\n\"He gives you no food?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"It is the way of many men with their dog,\" said Morano. \"They give him no food,\" and then he rubbed his hands cheerfully, \"and yet the dog does not die.\"\n\n\"And he gives you no wages?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Just these rings.\"\n\nNow Rodriguez had himself a ring upon his finger (as a gallant should), a slender piece of gold with four tiny angels holding a sapphire, and for a moment he pictured the sapphire passing into the hands of mine host and the ring of gold and the four small angels being flung to Morano; the thought darkened his gaiety for no longer than one of those fleecy clouds in Spring shadows the fields of Spain.\n\nMorano was also looking at the ring; he had followed the young man's glance.\n\n\"Master,\" he said, \"do you draw your sword of a night?\"\n\n\"And you?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"I have no sword,\" said Morano. \"I am but as dog's meat that needs no guarding, but you whose meat is rare like the flesh of the unicorn need a sword to guard your meat. The unicorn has his horn always, and even then he sometimes sleeps.\"\n\n\"It is bad, you think, to sleep,\" Rodriguez said.\n\n\"For some it is very bad, master. They say they never take the unicorn waking. For me I am but dog's meat: when I have eaten hams I curl up and sleep; but then you see, master, I know I shall wake in the morning.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Rodriguez, \"the morning's a pleasant time,\" and he leaned back comfortably in his chair. Morano took one shrewd look at him, and was soon asleep upon his three-legged stool.\n\nThe door opened after a while and mine host appeared. \"It is late,\" he said. Rodriguez smiled acquiescently and mine host withdrew, and presently leaving Morano whom his master's voice had waked, to curl up on the floor in a corner, Rodriguez took the candle that lit the room and passed once more through the passages of the inn and down the great corridor of the fastness of the family that had fallen on evil days, and so came to his chamber. I will not waste a multitude of words over that chamber; if you have no picture of it in your mind already, my reader, you are reading an unskilled writer, and if in that picture it appear a wholesome room, tidy and well kept up, if it appear a place in which a stranger might sleep without some faint foreboding of disaster, then I am wasting your time, and will waste no more of it with bits of \"descriptive writing\" about that dim, high room, whose blackness towered before Rodriguez in the night. He entered and shut the door, as many had done before him; but for all his youth he took some wiser precautions than had they, perhaps, who closed that door before. For first he drew his sword; then for some while he stood quite still near the door and listened to the rats; then he looked round the chamber and perceived only one door; then he looked at the heavy oak furniture, carved by some artist, gnawed by rats, and all blackened by time; then swiftly opened the door of the largest cupboard and thrust his sword in to see who might be inside, but the carved satyr's heads at the top of the cupboard eyed him silently and nothing moved. Then he noted that though there was no bolt on the door the furniture might be placed across to make what in the wars is called a barricado, but the wiser thought came at once that this was too easily done, and that if the danger that the dim room seemed gloomily to forebode were to come from a door so readily barricadoed, then those must have been simple gallants who parted so easily with the rings that adorned Morano's two little fingers. No, it was something more subtle than any attack through that door that brought his regular wages to Morano. Rodriguez looked at the window, which let in the light of a moon that was getting low, for the curtains had years ago been eaten up by the moths; but the window was barred with iron bars that were not yet rusted away, and looked out, thus guarded, over a sheer wall that even in the moonlight fell into blackness. Rodriguez then looked round for some hidden door, the sword all the while in his hand, and very soon he knew that room fairly well, but not its secret, nor why those unknown gallants had given up their rings.\n\nIt is much to know of an unknown danger that it really is unknown. Many have met their deaths through looking for danger from one particular direction, whereas had they perceived that they were ignorant of its direction they would have been wise in their ignorance. Rodriguez had the great discretion to understand clearly that he did not know the direction from which danger would come. He accepted this as his only discovery about that portentous room which seemed to beckon to him with every shadow and to sigh over him with every mournful draught, and to whisper to him unintelligible warnings with every rustle of tattered silk that hung about his bed. And as soon as he discovered that this was his only knowledge he began at once to make his preparations: he was a right young man for the wars. He divested himself of his shoes and doublet and the light cloak that hung from his shoulder and cast the clothes on a chair. Over the back of the chair he slung his girdle and the scabbard hanging therefrom and placed his plumed hat so that none could see that his Castilian blade was not in its resting-place. And when the sombre chamber had the appearance of one having undressed in it before retiring Rodriguez turned his attention to the bed, which he noticed to be of great depth and softness. That something not unlike blood had been spilt on the floor excited no wonder in Rodriguez; that vast chamber was evidently, as I have said, in the fortress of some great family, against one of whose walls the humble inn had once leaned for protection; the great family were gone: how they were gone Rodriguez did not know, but it excited no wonder in him to see blood on the boards: besides, two gallants may have disagreed; or one who loved not dumb animals might have been killing rats. Blood did not disturb him; but what amazed him, and would have surprised anyone who stood in that ruinous room, was that there were clean new sheets on the bed. Had you seen the state of the furniture and the floor, O my reader, and the vastness of the old cobwebs and the black dust that they held, the dead spiders and huge dead flies, and the living generation of spiders descending and ascending through the gloom, I say that you also would have been surprised at the sight of those nice clean sheets. Rodriguez noted the fact and continued his preparations. He took the bolster from underneath the pillow and laid it down the middle of the bed and put the sheets back over it; then he stood back and looked at it, much as a sculptor might stand back from his marble, then he returned to it and bent it a little in the middle, and after that he placed his mandolin on the pillow and nearly covered it with the sheet, but not quite, for a little of the curved dark-brown wood remained still to be seen. It looked wonderfully now like a sleeper in the bed, but Rodriguez was not satisfied with his work until he had placed his kerchief and one of his shoes where a shoulder ought to be; then he stood back once more and eyed it with satisfaction. Next he considered the light. He looked at the light of the moon and remembered his father's advice, as the young often do, but considered that this was not the occasion for it, and decided to leave the light of his candle instead, so that anyone who might be familiar with the moonlight in that shadowy chamber should find instead a less sinister light. He therefore dragged a table to the bedside, placed the candle upon it, and opened a treasured book that he bore in his doublet, and laid it on the bed near by, between the candle and his mandolin-headed sleeper; the name of the book was Notes in a Cathedral and dealt with the confessions of a young girl, which the author claimed to have jotted down, while concealed behind a pillow near the Confessional, every Sunday for the entire period of Lent. Lastly he pulled a sheet a little loose from the bed, until a corner of it lay on the floor; then he lay down on the boards, still keeping his sword in his hand, and by means of the sheet and some silk that hung from the bed, he concealed himself sufficient for his purpose, which was to see before he should be seen by any intruder that might enter that chamber.\n\nAnd if Rodriguez appear to have been unduly suspicious, it should be borne in mind not only that those empty rings needed much explanation, but that every house suggests to the stranger something; and that whereas one house seems to promise a welcome in front of cosy fires, another good fare, another joyous wine, this inn seemed to promise murder; or so the young man's intuition said, and the young are wise to trust to their intuitions.\n\nThe reader will know, if he be one of us, who have been to the wars and slept in curious ways, that it is hard to sleep when sober upon a floor; it is not like the earth, or snow, or a feather bed; even rock can be more accommodating; it is hard, unyielding and level, all night unmistakable floor. Yet Rodriguez took no risk of falling asleep, so he said over to himself in his mind as much as he remembered of his treasured book, Notes in a Cathedral, which he always read to himself before going to rest and now so sadly missed. It told how a lady who had listened to a lover longer than her soul's safety could warrant, as he played languorous music in the moonlight and sang soft by her low balcony, and how she being truly penitent, had gathered many roses, the emblems of love (as surely, she said at confession, all the world knows), and when her lover came again by moonlight had cast them all from her from the balcony, showing that she had renounced love; and her lover had entirely misunderstood her. It told how she often tried to show him this again, and all the misunderstandings are sweetly set forth and with true Christian penitence. Sometimes some little matter escaped Rodriguez's memory and then he longed to rise up and look at his dear book, yet he lay still where he was: and all the while he listened to the rats, and the rats went on gnawing and running regularly, scared by nothing new; Rodriguez trusted as much to their myriad ears as to his own two. The great spiders descended out of such heights that you could not see whence they came, and ascended again into blackness; it was a chamber of prodigious height. Sometimes the shadow of a descending spider that had come close to the candle assumed a frightening size, but Rodriguez gave little thought to it; it was of murder he was thinking, not of shadows; still, in its way it was ominous, and reminded Rodriguez horribly of his host; but what of an omen, again, in a chamber full of omens. The place itself was ominous; spiders could scarce make it more so. The spider itself was big enough, he thought, to be impaled on his Castilian blade; indeed, he would have done it but that he thought it wiser to stay where he was and watch. And then the spider found the candle too hot and climbed in a hurry all the way to the ceiling, and his horrible shadow grew less and dwindled away.\n\nIt was not that the rats were frightened: whatever it was that happened happened too quietly for that, but the volume of the sound of their running had suddenly increased: it was not like fear among them, for the running was no swifter, and it did not fade away; it was as though the sound of rats running, which had not been heard before, was suddenly heard now. Rodriguez looked at the door, the door was shut. A young Englishman would long ago have been afraid that he was making a fuss over nothing and would have gone to sleep in the bed, and not seen what Rodriguez saw. He might have thought that hearing more rats all at once was merely a fancy, and that everything was all right. Rodriguez saw a rope coming slowly down from the ceiling, he quickly determined whether it was a rope or only the shadow of some huge spider's thread, and then he watched it and saw it come down right over his bed and stop within a few feet of it. Rodriguez looked up cautiously to see who had sent him that strange addition to the portents that troubled the chamber, but the ceiling was too high and dim for him to perceive anything but the rope coming down out of the darkness. Yet he surmised that the ceiling must have softly opened, without any sound at all, at the moment that he heard the greater number of rats. He waited then to see what the rope would do; and at first it hung as still as the great festoons dead spiders had made in the corners; then as he watched it it began to sway. He looked up into the dimness then to see who was swaying the rope; and for a long time, as it seemed to him lying gripping his Castilian sword on the floor he saw nothing clearly. And then he saw mine host coming down the rope, hand over hand quite nimbly, as though he lived by this business. In his right hand he held a poniard of exceptional length, yet he managed to clutch the rope and hold the poniard all the time with the same hand.\n\nIf there had been something hideous about the shadow of the spider that came down from that height the shadow of mine host was indeed demoniac. He too was like a spider, with his body at no time slender all bunched up on the rope, and his shadow was six times his size: you could turn from the spider's shadow to the spider and see that it was for the most part a fancy of the candle half crazed by the draughts, but to turn from mine host's shadow to himself and to see his wicked eyes was to say that the candle's wildest fears were true. So he climbed down his rope holding his poniard upward. But when he came within perhaps ten feet of the bed he pointed it downward and began to sway about. It will be readily seen that by swaying his rope at a height mine host could drop on any part of the bed. Rodriguez as he watched him saw him scrutinise closely and continue to sway on his rope. He feared that mine host was ill satisfied with the look of the mandolin and that he would climb away again, well warned of his guest's astuteness, into the heights of the ceiling to devise some fearfuller scheme; but he was only looking for the shoulder. And then mine host dropped; poniard first, he went down with all his weight behind it and drove it through the bolster below where the shoulder should be, just where we slant our arms across our bodies, when we lie asleep on our sides, leaving the ribs exposed: and the soft bed received him. And the moment that mine host let go of his rope Rodriguez leaped to his feet. He saw Rodriguez, indeed their eyes met as he dropped through the air, but what could mine host do? He was already committed to his stroke, and his poniard was already deep in the mattress when the good Castilian blade passed through his ribs.\n\n# The Second Chronicle - How He Hired a Memorable Servant\n\n## *\n\nWhen Rodriguez woke, the birds were singing gloriously. The sun was up and the air was sparkling over Spain. The gloom had left his high chamber, and much of the menace had gone from it that overnight had seemed to bode in the corners. It had not become suddenly tidy; it was still more suitable for spiders than men, it still mourned and brooded over the great family that it had nursed and that evil days had so obviously overtaken; but it no longer had the air of finger to lips, no longer seemed to share a secret with you, and that secret Murder. The rats still ran round the wainscot, but the song of the birds and the jolly, dazzling sunshine were so much larger than the sombre room that the young man's thoughts escaped from it and ran free to the fields. It may have been only his fancy but the world seemed somehow brighter for the demise of mine host of the Dragon and Knight, whose body still lay hunched up on the foot of his bed. Rodriguez jumped up and went to the high, barred window and looked out of it at the morning: far below him a little town with red roofs lay; the smoke came up from the chimneys toward him slowly, and spread out flat and did not reach so high. Between him and the roofs swallows were sailing.\n\nHe found water for washing in a cracked pitcher of earthenware and as he dressed he looked up at the ceiling and admired mine host's device, for there was an open hole that had come noiselessly, without any sounds of bolts or lifting of trap-doors, but seemed to have opened out all round on perfectly oiled grooves, to fit that well-to-do body, and down from the middle of it from some higher beam hung the rope down which mine host had made his last journey.\n\nBefore taking leave of his host Rodriguez looked at his poniard, which was a good two feet in length, not counting the hilt, and was surprised to find it an excellent blade. It bore a design on the steel representing a town, which Rodriguez recognised for the towers of Toledo; and had held moreover a jewel at the end of the hilt, but the little gold socket was empty. Rodriguez therefore perceived that the poniard was that of a gallant, and surmised that mine host had begun his trade with a butcher's knife, but having come by the poniard had found it to be handier for his business. Rodriguez being now fully dressed, girt his own blade about him, and putting the poniard under his cloak, for he thought to find a use for it at the wars, set his plumed hat upon him and jauntily stepped from the chamber. By the light of day he saw clearly at what point the passages of the inn had dared to make their intrusion on the corridors of the fortress, for he walked for four paces between walls of huge grey rocks which had never been plastered and were clearly a breach in the fortress, though whether the breach were made by one of the evil days that had come upon the family in their fastness, and whether men had poured through it with torches and swords, or whether the gap had been cut in later years for mine host of the Dragon and Knight, and he had gone quietly through it rubbing his hands, nothing remained to show Rodriguez now.\n\nWhen he came to the dining-chamber he found Morano astir. Morano looked up from his overwhelming task of tidying the Inn of the Dragon and Knight and then went on with his pretended work, for he felt a little ashamed of the knowledge he had concerning the ways of that inn, which was more than an honest man should know about such a place.\n\n\"Good morning, Morano,\" said Rodriguez blithely.\n\n\"Good morning,\" answered the servant of the Dragon and Knight.\n\n\"I am looking for the wars. Would you like a new master, Morano?\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Morano, \"a good master is better to some men's minds than a bad one. Yet, you see senor, my bad master has me bound never to leave him, by oaths that I do not properly understand the meaning of, and that might blast me in any world were I to forswear them. He hath bound me by San Sathanas, with many others. I do not like the sound of that San Sathanas. And so you see, senor, my bad master suits me better than perhaps to be whithered in this world by a levin-stroke, and in the next world who knows?\"\n\n\"Morano,\" said Rodriguez, \"there is a dead spider on my bed.\"\n\n\"A dead spider, master?\" said Morano, with as much concern in his voice as though no spider had ever sullied that chamber before.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Rodriguez, \"I shall require you to keep my bed tidy on our way to the wars.\"\n\n\"Master,\" said Morano, \"no spider shall come near it, living or dead.\"\n\nAnd so our company of one going northward through Spain looking for romance became a company of two.\n\n\"Master,\" said Morano, \"as I do not see him whom I serve, and his ways are early ways, I fear some evil has overtaken him, whereby we shall be suspect, for none other dwells here: and he is under special protection of the Garda Civil; it would be well therefore to start for the wars right early.\"\n\n\"The guard protect mine host then.\" Rodriguez said with as much surprise in his tones as he ever permitted himself.\n\n\"Master,\" Morano said, \"it could not be otherwise. For so many gallants have entered the door of this inn and supped in this chamber and never been seen again, and so many suspicious things have been found here, such as blood, that it became necessary for him to pay the guard well, and so they protect him.\" And Morano hastily slung over his shoulder by leather straps an iron pot and a frying-pan and took his broad felt hat from a peg on the wall.\n\nRodriguez' eyes looked so curiously at the great cooking utensils dangling there from the straps that Morano perceived his young master did not fully understand these preparations: he therefore instructed him thus: \"Master, there be two things necessary in the wars, strategy and cooking. Now the first of these comes in use when the captains speak of their achievements and the historians write of the wars. Strategy is a learned thing, master, and the wars may not be told of without it, but while the war rageth and men be camped upon the foughten field then is the time for cooking; for many a man that fights the wars, if he hath not his food, were well content to let the enemy live, but feed him and at once he becometh proud at heart and cannot a-bear the sight of the enemy walking among his tents but must needs slay him outright. Aye, master, the cooking for the wars; and when the wars are over you who are learned shall study strategy.\"\n\nAnd Rodriguez perceived that there was wisdom in the world that was not taught in the College of San Josephus, near to his father's valleys, where he had learned in his youth the ways of books.\n\n\"Morano,\" he said, \"let us now leave mine host to entertain la Garda.\"\n\nAnd at the mention of the guard hurry came on Morano, he closed his lips upon his store of wisdom, and together they left the Inn of the Dragon and Knight. And when Rodriguez saw shut behind him that dark door of oak that he had so persistently entered, and through which he had come again to the light of the sun by many precautions and some luck, he felt gratitude to Morano. For had it not been for Morano's sinister hints, and above all his remark that mine host would have driven him thence because he liked him, the evil look of the sombre chamber alone might not have been enough to persuade him to the precautions that cut short the dreadful business of that inn. And with his gratitude was a feeling not unlike remorse, for he felt that he had deprived this poor man of a part of his regular wages, which would have been his own gold ring and the setting that held the sapphire, had all gone well with the business. So he slipped the ring from his finger and gave it to Morano, sapphire and all.\n\nMorano's expressions of gratitude were in keeping with that flowery period in Spain, and might appear ridiculous were I to expose them to the eyes of an age in which one in Morano's place on such an occasion would have merely said, \"Damned good of you old nut, not half,\" and let the matter drop.\n\nI merely record therefore that Morano was grateful and so expressed himself; while Rodriguez, in addition to the pleasant glow in the mind that comes from a generous action, had another feeling that gives all of us pleasure, or comfort at least (until it grows monotonous), a feeling of increased safety; for while he had the ring upon his finger and Morano went unpaid the thought could not help occurring, even to a generous mind, that one of these windy nights Morano might come for his wages.\n\n\"Master,\" said Morano looking at the sapphire now on his own little finger near the top joint, the only stone amongst his row of rings, \"you must surely have great wealth.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Rodriguez slapping the scabbard that held his Castilian blade. And when he saw that Morano's eyes were staring at the little emeralds that were dotted along the velvet of the scabbard he explained that it was the sword that was his wealth:\n\n\"For in the wars,\" he said, \"are all things to be won, and nothing is unobtainable to the sword. For parchment and custom govern all the possessions of man, as they taught me in the College of San Josephus. Yet the sword is at first the founder and discoverer of all possessions; and this my father told me before he gave me this sword, which hath already acquired in the old time fair castles with many a tower.\"\n\n\"And those that dwelt in the castles, master, before the sword came?\" said Morano.\n\n\"They died and went dismally to Hell,\" said Rodriguez, \"as the old songs say.\"\n\nThey walked on then in silence. Morano, with his low forehead and greater girth of body than of brain to the superficial observer, was not incapable of thought. However slow his thoughts may have come, Morano was pondering surely. Suddenly the puckers on his little forehead cleared and he brightly looked at Rodriguez as they went on side by side.\n\n\"Master,\" Morano said, \"when you choose a castle in the wars, let it above all things be one of those that is easy to be defended; for castles are easily got, as the old songs tell, and in the heat of combat positions are quickly stormed, and no more ado; but, when wars are over, then is the time for ease and languorous days and the imperilling of the soul, though not beyond the point where our good fathers may save it.\"\n\n\"Nay, Morano,\" Rodriguez said, \"no man, as they taught me well in the College of San Josephus, should ever imperil his soul.\"\n\n\"But, master,\" Morano said, \"a man imperils his body in the wars yet hopes by dexterity and his sword to draw it safely thence: so a man of courage and high heart may surely imperil his soul and still hope to bring it at the last to salvation.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" said Rodriguez, and gave his mind to pondering upon the exact teaching he had received on this very point, but could not clearly remember.\n\nSo they walked in silence, Rodriguez thinking still of this spiritual problem, Morano turning, though with infinite slowness, to another thought upon a lower plane.\n\nAnd after a while Rodriguez' eyes turned again to the flowers, and he felt his meditation, as youth will, and looking abroad he saw the wonder of Spring calling forth the beauty of Spain, and he lifted up his head and his heart rejoiced with the anemones, as hearts at his age do: but Morano clung to his thought.\n\nIt was long before Rodriguez' fanciful thoughts came back from among the flowers, for among those delicate earliest blooms of Spring his youthful visions felt they were with familiars; so they tarried, neglecting the dusty road and poor gross Morano. But when his fancies left the flowers at last and looked again at Morano, Rodriguez perceived that his servant was all troubled with thought: so he left Morano in silence for his thought to come to maturity, for he had formed a liking already for the judgments of Morano's simple mind.\n\nThey walked in silence for the space of an hour, and at last Morano spoke. It was then noon. \"Master,\" he said, \"at this hour it is the custom of la Garda to enter the Inn of the Dragon and to dine at the expense of mine host.\"\n\n\"A merry custom,\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Master,\" said Morano, \"if they find him in less than his usual health they will get their dinners for themselves in the larder and dine and afterwards sleep. But after that; master, after that, should anything inauspicious have befallen mine host, they will seek out and ask many questions concerning all travellers, too many for our liking.\"\n\n\"We are many good miles from the Inn of the Dragon and Knight,\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Master, when they have eaten and slept and asked questions they will follow on horses,\" said Morano.\n\n\"We can hide,\" said Rodriguez, and he looked round over the plain, very full of flowers, but empty and bare under the blue sky of any place in which a man might hide to escape from pursuers on horse back. He perceived then that he had no plan.\n\n\"Master,\" said Morano, \"there is no hiding like disguises.\"\n\nOnce more Rodriguez looked round him over the plain, seeing no houses, no men; and his opinion of Morano's judgment sank when he said disguises. But then Morano unfolded to him that plan which up to that day had never been tried before, so far as records tell, in all the straits in which fugitive men have been; and which seems from my researches in verse and prose never to have been attempted since.\n\nThe plan was this, astute as Morano, and simple as his naive mind. The clothing for which Rodriguez searched the plain vainly was ready to hand. No disguise was effective against la Garda, they had too many suspicions, their skill was to discover disguises. But in the moment of la Garda's triumph, when they had found out the disguise, when success had lulled the suspicions for which they were infamous, then was the time to trick la Garda. Rodriguez wondered; but the slow mind of Morano was sure, and now he came to the point, the fruit of his hour's thinking. Rodriguez should disguise himself as Morano. When la Garda discovered that he was not the man he appeared to be, a study to which they devoted their lives, their suspicions would rest and there w\n", "final_result_str": "repair", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "1334b814-e3ca-41fa-88be-79b99fffa701", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "need_repair", "evidence": "前置目录的书籍"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "c052588c-e6d0-4e5b-a0b0-601df2f0d946", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "正常的小说"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "6d283bb9-06ae-44fc-b639-6e8d5de693f0", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "书籍"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "e5928043-ebc7-4406-93d9-07b704cdb717", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 逻辑：段落间有逻辑"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

She had enjoyed an excellent\ndinner: she was beautifully dressed: and shortly she would witness the\nnewest musical comedy; three very good reasons for her amiable\nexpression. \"All people are dangerous to millionaires,\" she remarked,\npointing the compliment at her employer, \"since all people enjoy life\nwith wealth, and wish to get the millionaire's money honestly or\ndishonestly.\"\n\n\"The people you mention have failed to get mine, Mrs. Bolstreath,\" was\nthe millionaire's dry response.\n\n\"Of course I speak generally and not of any particular person, Sir\nCharles.\"\n\n\"I am aware of it,\" he answered, nodding and showed a tendency to\nrelapse into his meditation, but that his daughter raised her price\nfor confession.\n\n\"A sixpence for your thoughts, dad, a shilling--ten shillings--then\none pound, you insatiable person.\"\n\n\"My kingdom for an explicit statement,\" murmured Dan, laying aside the\ncrackers. \"Lillian, my child, you must not eat any more nuts or you\nwill be having indigestion.\"\n\n\"I believe dad has indigestion already.\"\n\n\"Some people will have it very badly before I am done with them,\" said\nSir Charles, not echoing his daughter's laughter; then, to prevent\nfurther questions being asked, he addressed himself to the young man.\n\"How are things going with you, Halliday?\"\n\nWhen Sir Charles asked questions thus stiffly, Dan knew that he was\nnot too well pleased, and guessed the reason, which had to do with\nLillian, and with Lillian's friendly attitude towards a swain not\noverburdened with money--to wit, his very own self--who replied\ndiplomatically. \"Things are going up with me, sir, if you mean\naeroplanes.\"\n\n\"Frivolous! Frivolous!\" muttered the big man seriously, \"as a\nwell-educated young man who wants money, you should aim at higher\nthings.\"\n\n\"He aims at the sun,\" said Lillian gaily, \"how much higher do you\nexpect him to aim, dad?\"\n\n\"Aiming at the sun is he?\" said Moon heavily, \"h'm! he'll be like that\nclassical chap who flew too high and came to smash.\"\n\n\"Do you mean Icarus or Phaeton, Sir Charles?\" asked Mrs. Bolstreath,\nwho, having been a governess, prided herself upon exceptional\nknowledge.\n\n\"I don't know which of the two, perhaps one, perhaps both. But he flew\nin an aeroplane like Dan here, and came to grief.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Lillian turned distinctly pale. \"I hope, Dan, you won't come to\ngrief.\"\n\nBefore the guest could reply, Sir Charles reassured his daughter.\n\"Naught was never in danger,\" he said, still grim and unsmiling,\n\"don't trouble, Lillian, my dear. Dan won't come to grief in that way,\nalthough he may in another.\"\n\nLillian opened her blue eyes and stared while young Halliday grew\ncrimson and fiddled with the nut-shells. \"I don't know what you mean,\ndad?\" said the girl after a puzzled pause.\n\n\"I think Dan does,\" rejoined her father, rising and pushing back his\nchair slowly. He looked at his watch, \"Seven-thirty; you have plenty\nof time to see your play, which does not begin until nine,\" he added,\nwalking towards the door. \"Mrs. Bolstreath, I should like to speak\nwith you.\"\n\n\"But, dad----\"\n\n\"My dear Lillian, I have no time to wait. There is an important\nappointment at nine o'clock here, and afterwards I must go to the\nHouse. Go and enjoy yourself, but don't\"--here his stern gray eyes\nrested on Dan's bent head in a significant way--\"don't be foolish.\nMrs. Bolstreath,\" he beckoned, and left the room.\n\n\"Oh!\" sighed the chaperon-governess-companion, for she was all three,\na kind of modern Cerebus, guarding the millionaire's child. \"I thought\nit would come to this!\" and she also looked significantly at Halliday\nbefore she vanished to join her employer.\n\nLillian stared at the closed door through which both her father and\nMrs. Bolstreath had passed, and then looked at Dan, sitting somewhat\ndisconsolately at the disordered dinner-table. She was a delicately\npretty girl of a fair, fragile type, not yet twenty years of age, and\nresembled a shepherdess of Dresden china in her dainty perfection.\nWith her pale golden hair, and rose-leaf complexion, arrayed in a\nsimple white silk frock with snowy pearls round her slender neck, she\nlooked like a wraith of faint mist. At least Dan fancifully thought\nso, as he stole a glance at her frail beauty, or perhaps she was more\nlike a silver-point drawing, exquisitely fine. But whatever image love\nmight find to express her loveliness, Dan knew in his hot passion that\nshe was the one girl in the world for him. Lillian Halliday was a much\nbetter name for her than Lillian Moon.\n\nDan himself was tall and slim, dark and virile, with a clear-cut,\nclean-shaven face suggestive of strength and activity. His bronzed\ncomplexion showed an open-air life, while the eagle look in his dark\neyes was that new vast-distance expression rapidly being acquired by\nthose who devote themselves to aviation. No one could deny Dan's good\nlooks or clean life, or daring nature, and he was all that a girl\ncould desire in the way of a fairy prince. But fathers do not approve\nof fairy princes unless they come laden with jewels and gold. To bring\nsuch to Lillian was rather like taking coals to Newcastle since her\nfather was so wealthy; but much desires more, and Sir Charles wanted a\nrich son-in-law. Dan could not supply this particular adjective, and\ntherefore--as he would have put it in the newest slang of the newest\nprofession--was out of the fly. Not that he intended to be, in spite\nof Sir Charles, since love can laugh at stern fathers as easily as at\nbolts and bars.\n\nAnd all this time Lillian stared at the door, and then at Dan, and\nthen at her plate, putting two and two together. But in spite of her\nfeminine intuition, she could not make four, and turned to her\nlover--for that Dan was, and a declared lover too--for an explanation.\n\"What does dad mean?\" Dan raised his handsome head and laughed as\ngrimly as Sir Charles had done earlier. \"He means that I shan't be\nasked to dinner any more.\"\n\n\"Why? You have done nothing.\"\n\n\"No; but I intend to do something.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\nDan glanced at the closed door and seeing that there was no immediate\nchance of butler or footmen entering took her in his arms. \"Marry\nyou,\" he whispered between two kisses.\n\n\"There's no intention about that,\" pouted the girl; \"we have settled\nthat ever so long ago.\"\n\n\"So your father suspects, and for that reason he is warning Mrs.\nBolstreath.\"\n\n\"Warning the dragon,\" said Miss Moon, who used the term quite in an\naffectionate way, \"why, the dragon is on our side.\"\n\n\"I daresay your father guesses as much. For that reason I'll stake my\nlife that he is telling her at this moment she must never let us be\ntogether alone after this evening. After all, my dear, I don't see why\nyou should look at me in such a puzzled way. You know well enough that\nSir Charles wants you to marry Curberry.\"\n\n\"Marry Lord Curberry,\" cried Lillian, her pale skin coloring to a deep\nrose hue; \"why I told dad I wouldn't do that.\"\n\n\"Did you tell dad that you loved me?\"\n\n\"No. There's no need to,\" said the girl promptly.\n\nDan coughed drily. \"I quite agree with you,\" he said rising, \"there's\nno need to, since every time I look at you, I give myself away. But\nyou surely understand, darling, that as I haven't a title and I\nhaven't money, I can't have you. Hothouse grapes are for the rich and\nnot for a poor devil like me.\"\n\n\"You might find a prettier simile,\" laughed Lillian, not at all\ndiscomposed, although she now thoroughly understood the meaning of her\nfather's abrupt departure with Mrs. Bolstreath. Then she rose and took\nDan by the lapels of his coat, upon which he promptly linked her to\nhimself by placing both arms round her waist. \"Dearest,\" she said\nearnestly, \"I shall marry you and you only. We have been brought up\nmore or less together, and we have always loved one another. Dad was\nyour guardian: you have three hundred a year of your own, and if we\nmarry dad can give us plenty, and----\"\n\n\"I know all that,\" interrupted Halliday, placing her arms round his\nneck, \"and it is just because Sir Charles knows also, that he will\nnever consent to our marriage. I knew what was in the wind weeks ago,\ndarling heart, and every day I have been expecting what has occurred\nto-night. For that reason, I have come here as often as possible and\nhave arranged for you and the dragon to go to the theatre to-night.\nBut, believe me, Lillian, it will be for the last time. To-morrow I\nshall receive a note saying that I am to stay away from Lord\nCurberry's bride.\"\n\n\"I'm not his bride and I never shall be,\" stamped Lillian, and the\ntears came into her pretty eyes, whereupon Dan, as a loyal lover,\nwiped them away with his pocket-handkerchief tenderly,   \"and--and--\"\nshe faltered.\n\n\"And--and--\" he mocked, knowing her requirements, which led him to\nconsole her with a long and lingering kiss. \"Oh!\" he sighed and\nLillian, nestling in his arms, echoed the sigh. The moment of perfect\nunderstanding and perfect love held them until the sudden opening of\nthe door placed Dan on one side of the table and Lillian on the other.\n\n\"It won't do, my dears,\" said the new-comer, who was none other than\nMrs. Bolstreath, flaming with wrath, but not, as the lovers found\nlater, at them. \"I know quite well that Dan hasn't wasted his time in\nthis league-divided wooing.\"\n\n\"We thought that one of the servants----\" began the young man, when\nMrs. Bolstreath interrupted.\n\n\"Well, and am I not one of the servants? Sir Charles has reminded me\nof the fact three times with the information that I am not worth my\nsalt, much less the good table he keeps.\"\n\n\"Oh! Bolly dear,\" and Lillian ran to the stout chaperon to embrace her\nwith many kisses, \"was dad nasty?\"\n\n\"He wasn't agreeable,\" assented Mrs. Bolstreath, fanning herself with\nher handkerchief, for the interview had heated her. \"You can't expect\nhim to be, my sweet, when his daughter loves a pauper.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" murmured Dan bowing, \"but don't you think it is time we\nwent to the theatre, Bolly dear.\"\n\n\"You must not be so familiar, young man,\" said the chaperon, broadly\nsmiling at the dark handsome face. \"Sir Charles wants Lillian to\nmarry----\"\n\n\"Then I shan't!\" Lillian stamped again, \"I hate Lord Curberry.\"\n\n\"And you love Dan!\"\n\n\"Don't be so familiar, young woman,\" said Halliday, in a joking way,\n\"unless you are on our side, that is.\"\n\n\"If I were not on your side,\" rejoined Mrs. Bolstreath, majestically,\n\"I should be the very dragon Lillian calls me. After all, Dan, you\n_are_ poor.\"\n\n\"Poor, but honest.\"\n\n\"Worse and worse. Honest people never grow rich. And then you have\nsuch a dangerous profession, taking people flying trips in those\naeroplanes. One never can be sure if you will be home to supper. I'm\nsure Lillian would not care to marry a husband who was uncertain about\nbeing home for supper.\"\n\n\"I'll marry Dan,\" said Lillian, and embraced Dan, who returned the\nembrace.\n\n\"Children! Children!\" Mrs. Bolstreath raised her hands in horror,\n\"think of what you are doing. The servants may be in at any moment.\nCome to the drawing-room and have coffee. The motor-car is waiting and\n--hush, separate, separate,\" cried the chaperon, \"someone is coming!\"\n\nShe spoke truly, for the lovers had just time to fly asunder when\nSir Charles's secretary entered swiftly. He was a lean, tall,\nhaggard-looking young fellow of thirty with a pallid complexion and scanty\nlight hair. A thin moustache half concealed a weak mouth, and he\nblinked his eyes in a nervous manner when he bowed to the ladies\nand excused his presence. \"Sir Charles left his spectacles here,\" he\nsaid in a soft and rather unsteady voice, \"he sent me for them\nand----\" he had glided to the other side of the table by this\ntime--\"oh, here they are. The motor-car waits, Miss Moon.\"\n\n\"Where is my father?\" asked Lillian irrelevantly. \"Tell me, Mr. Penn.\"\n\n\"In the library, Miss Moon,\" said the secretary glibly, \"but he cannot\nsee any one just now--not even you, Miss Moon.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"He is waiting to interview an official from Scotland Yard--a Mr.\nDurwin on important business.\"\n\n\"You see,\" murmured Dan to Lillian in an undertone, \"your father\nintends to lock me up for daring to love you.\"\n\nMiss Moon took no notice. \"What is the business?\" she asked sharply.\n\n\"Indeed, I don't know, Miss Moon. It is strictly private. Sir Charles\nhas related nothing to me. And if you will excuse me--if you don't\nmind--these spectacles are wanted and----\" he babbled himself out of\nthe room, while Mrs. Bolstreath turned on her charge.\n\n\"You don't mean to say, you foolish child, that you were going to see\nyour father about 'this'!\" she indicated Halliday.\n\n\"I don't care about being called a 'this'!\" said Dan, stiffly.\n\nNeither lady noticed the protest. \"I want to make it clear to my\nfather as soon as possible, that I shall marry Dan and no one else,\"\ndeclared Lillian, pursing up her pretty mouth obstinately.\n\n\"Then take him at the right moment,\" retorted Mrs. Bolstreath crossly,\nfor the late interview had tried even her amiable temper. \"Just now he\nis seething with indignation that an aviator should dare to raise his\neyes to you.\"\n\n\"Aviators generally look down,\" said Dan flippantly; \"am I to be\nallowed to take you and Lillian to the theatre this evening?\"\n\n\"Yes. Although Sir Charles mentioned that you would do better to spend\nyour money on other things than mere frivolity.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Halliday with a shrug, \"as to that, this particular\nfrivolity is costing me nothing. I got the box from Freddy Laurance,\nwho is on that very up-to-date newspaper _The Moment_ as a reporter. I\nhave dined at my future father-in-law's expense, and now I go in his\nmotor-car without paying for the trip. I don't see that my pleasures\ncould cost me less. Even Sir Charles must be satisfied with such\nstrict economy.\"\n\n\"Sir Charles will be satisfied with nothing save a promise for you to\ngo away and leave Lillian alone,\" said Mrs. Bolstreath, sadly, \"he has\nno feeling of romance such as makes me foolish enough to encourage a\npauper.\"\n\n\"You called me that before,\" said Dan, coolly, \"well, there's no\ngetting over facts. I am a pauper, but I love Lillian.\"\n\n\"And I--\" began Lillian, advancing, only to be waved back and\nprevented from speaking further by Mrs. Bolstreath.\n\n\"Don't make love before my very eyes,\" she said crossly, \"after all I\nam paid to keep you two apart, and--and--well, there's no time for\ncoffee, so we had better finish the discussion in the car. There is\nplenty of time between Hampstead and the Strand to allow of a long\nargument. And remember, Dan,\" Mrs. Bolstreath turned at the door to\nshake her finger, \"this is your last chance of uninterrupted\nconversation with Lillian.\"\n\n\"Let us make honey while the flowers bloom,\" whispered Halliday,\npoetically, and stole a final and hasty kiss before he led the girl\nafter the amiable dragon, who had already left the room.\n\nThe lovers found her talking to a poorly-dressed and rather stout\nfemale clothed in rusty mourning, who looked the picture of decent but\nrespectable poverty. The entrance door stood open, and the waiting\nmotor-car could be seen at the steps, while the footman stood near\nMrs. Bolstreath, watching her chatting to the stranger and wearing an\ninjured expression. It seemed that the decent woman wished to see Sir\nCharles, and the footman had refused her admission since his master\nwas not to be disturbed. The woman--she called herself Mrs. Brown and\nwas extremely tearful--had therefore appealed to the dragon, who was\nexplaining that she could do nothing.\n\n\"Oh, but I am sure you can get Sir Charles Moon to see me, my lady,\"\nwailed Mrs. Brown with a dingy handkerchief to her red eyes, \"my son\nhas been lost overboard off one of those steamers Sir Charles owns,\nand I want to ask him to give me some money. My son was my only\nsupport, and now I am starving.\"\n\nLillian knew that her father owned a number of tramp steamers, which\npicked up cargoes all over the world, and saw no reason why the woman\nshould not have the interview since her son had been drowned while in\nMoon's service. The hour was certainly awkward, since Sir Charles had\nan appointment before he went down to the House. But a starving woman\nand a sorrowful woman required some consideration so she stepped\nforward hastily and touched Mrs. Brown's rusty cloak.\n\n\"I shall ask my father to see you,\" she said quickly, \"wait here!\" and\nwithout consulting Mrs. Bolstreath she went impulsively to her\nfather's study, while Mrs. Brown dabbed her eyes with her handkerchief\nand called down blessings on her young head.\n\nDan believed the story of the lost son, but doubted the tale of\nstarvation as Mrs. Brown looked too stout to have been without food\nfor any length of time. He looked hard at her face, which was more\nwrinkled than a fat woman's should be; although such lines might be\nascribed to grief. She wept profusely and was so overcome with sorrow\nthat she let down a ragged veil when she saw Dan's eager gaze. The\nyoung gentleman, she observed, could not understand a mother's\nfeelings, or he would not make a show of her by inquisitorial glances.\nThe remark was somewhat irrelevant, and the action of letting down the\nveil unnecessary, but much might be pardoned to a woman so obviously\nafflicted.\n\nDan was about to excuse his inquiring looks, when Lillian danced back\nwith the joyful information that her father would see Mrs. Brown for a\nfew minutes if she went in at once. \"And I have asked him to help\nyou,\" said the girl, patting the tearful woman's shoulder, as she\npassed to the motor-car. \"Oh! it's past eight o'clock. Dan, we'll\nnever be in time.\"\n\n\"The musical comedy doesn't begin until nine,\" Halliday assured her,\nand in a few minutes the three of them were comfortably seated in the\nluxurious car, which whirled at break-neck speed towards the Strand.\n\nOf course Lillian and Dan took every advantage of the opportunity,\nseeing that Mrs. Bolstreath was sympathetic enough to close her eyes\nto their philanderings. They talked all the way to the Curtain\nTheatre; they talked all through the musical comedy; and talked all\nthe way back to the house at Hampstead. Mrs. Bolstreath, knowing that\nthe young couple would not have another opportunity for uninterrupted\nlove-making, and being entirely in favor of the match, attended to the\nstage and left them to whisper unreproved. She did not see why Dan,\nwhom Lillian had loved since the pair had played together as children,\nshould be set aside in favor of a dry-as-dust barrister, even though\nhe had lately come into a fortune and a title. \"But, of course,\" said\nMrs. Bolstreath between the facts, \"if you could only invent a perfect\nflying-machine, they would make you a duke or something and give you a\nlarge income. Then you could marry.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about, Bolly darling?\" asked Lillian, much\npuzzled, as she could not be supposed to know what was going on inside\nher friend's head.\n\n\"About you and Dan, dear. He has no money and----\"\n\n\"I shall make heaps and heaps of money,\" said Dan, sturdily; \"aviation\nis full of paying possibilities, and the nation that first obtains\ncommand of the air will rule the world. I'm no fool!\"\n\n\"You're a commoner,\" snapped Mrs. Bolstreath quickly, \"and unless, as\nI said, you are made a duke for inventing a perfect aeroplane, Lord\nCurberry is certainly a better match for Lillian.\"\n\n\"He's as dull as tombs,\" said Miss Moon with her pretty nose in the\nair.\n\n\"You can't expect to have everything, my dear child.\"\n\n\"I can expect to have Dan,\" retorted Lillian decidedly, whereat Dan\nwhispered sweet words and squeezed his darling's gloved hand.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Bolstreath, as the curtain rose on the second act,\n\"I'll do my best to help you since I believe in young love and true\nlove. Hush, children, people are looking! Attend to the stage.\"\n\nDan and Lillian did their best to follow her advice and sat demurely\nin their stalls side by side, watching the heroine flirt in a duet\nwith the hero, both giving vent to their feelings in a lively musical\nnumber. But they really took little interest in \"The Happy Bachelor!\"\nas the piece was called, in spite of the pretty girls and the charming\nmusic and the artistic dresses and the picturesque scenery. They were\ntogether and that was all they cared about, and although a dark cloud\nof parental opposition hovered over them, they were not yet enveloped\nin its gloom. And after all, since Mrs. Bolstreath was strongly\nprejudiced in their favor, Lillian hoped that she might induce Sir\nCharles to change his mind as regards Lord Curberry. He loved his\ndaughter dearly and would not like to see her unhappy, as she\ncertainly would be if compelled to marry any one but Dan. Lillian said\nthis to Mrs. Bolstreath and to Dan several times on the way home, and\nthey entirely agreed with her.\n\n\"Although I haven't much influence with Sir Charles,\" Mrs. Bolstreath\nwarned them, \"and he is fond of having his own way.\"\n\n\"He always does what I ask,\" said Lillian confidently. \"Why, although\nhe was so busy this evening he saw Mrs. Brown when I pleaded for her.\"\n\n\"He couldn't resist you,\" whispered Dan fondly, \"no one could.\"\n\nMrs. Bolstreath argued this point, saying that Lillian was Sir\nCharles's daughter, and fathers could not be expected to feel like\nlovers. She also mentioned that she was jeopardizing her situation by\nadvocating the match, which was certainly a bad one from a financial\npoint of view, and would be turned out of doors as an old romantic\nfool. The lovers assured her she was the most sensible of women and\nthat if she was turned out of doors they would take her in to the\ncottage where they proposed to reside like two turtle doves. Then came\nlaughter and kisses and the feeling that the world was not such a bad\nplace after all. It was a very merry trio that alighted at the door of\nMoon's great Hampstead mansion.\n\nThen came a shock, the worse for being wholly unexpected. At the door\nthe three were met by Marcus Penn, who was Moon's secretary. He looked\nleaner and more haggard than ever, and his general attitude was that\nof the bearer of evil news. Dan and Lillian and Mrs. Bolstreath stared\nat him in amazement. \"You may as well know the worst at once, Miss\nMoon,\" said Penn, his lips quivering with nervousness, \"your father is\ndead. He has been murdered.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nA COMPLETE MYSTERY\n\n\nIt was Mrs. Bolstreath who carried Lillian upstairs in her stout arms,\nfor when Penn made his brusque announcement the girl fainted straight\naway, which was very natural considering the horror of the\ninformation. Dan remained behind to tell the secretary that he was\nseveral kinds of fool, since no one but a superfine ass would blurt\nout so terrible a story to a delicate girl. Not that Penn had told his\nstory, for Lillian had become unconscious the moment her bewildered\nbrain grasped that the father she had left a few hours earlier in good\nhealth and spirits was now a corpse. But he told it to Dan, and\nmentioned that Mr. Durwin was in the library wherein the death had\ntaken place.\n\n\"Mr. Durwin? Who is Mr. Durwin?\" asked Dan trying to collect his\nsenses, which had been scattered by the dreadful news.\n\n\"An official from Scotland Yard; I told you so after dinner,\" said\nPenn in an injured tone, \"he came to see Sir Charles by appointment at\nnine o'clock and found him a corpse.\"\n\n\"Sir Charles was alive when we left shortly after eight,\" remarked Dan\nsharply; \"at a quarter-past eight to be precise. What took place in\nthe meantime?\"\n\n\"Obviously the violent death of Sir Charles,\" faltered the secretary.\n\n\"What evidence have you to show that he died by violence?\" asked\nHalliday.\n\n\"Mr. Durwin called in a doctor, and he says that Sir Charles had been\npoisoned,\" blurted out Penn uneasily. \"I believe that woman--Mrs.\nBrown she called herself--poisoned him. She left the house at a\nquarter to nine, so the footman says, for he let her out, and----\"\n\n\"It is impossible that a complete stranger should poison Sir Charles,\"\ninterrupted Dan impatiently, \"she would not have the chance.\"\n\n\"She was alone with Sir Charles for thirty minutes, more or less,\"\nsaid Penn tartly; \"she had every chance and she took it.\"\n\n\"But how could she induce Sir Charles to drink poison?\"\n\n\"She didn't induce him to drink anything. The doctor says that the\nscratch at the back of the dead man's neck----\"\n\n\"Here!\" Dan roughly pushed the secretary aside, becoming impatient of\nthe scrappy way in which he detailed what had happened. \"Let me go to\nthe library for myself and see what has happened. Sir Charles can't be\ndead.\"\n\n\"It's twelve o'clock now,\" retorted Penn stepping aside, \"and he's\nbeen dead quite three hours, as the doctor will tell you.\"\n\nBefore the man finished his sentence, Dan, scarcely grasping the\nsituation, so rapidly had it evolved, ran through the hall, towards\nthe back of the spacious house, where the library was situated. He\ndashed into the large and luxuriously furnished room and collided with\na police officer, who promptly took him by the shoulder. There were\nthree other men in the room, who turned from the corpse at which they\nwere looking, when they heard the noise of Halliday's abrupt entrance.\nThe foremost man, and the one who spoke first, was short and stout and\narrayed in uniform, with cold gray eyes, and a hard mouth.\n\n\"What's this--what's this?\" he demanded in a raucous voice. \"Who are\nyou?\"\n\n\"My name is Halliday,\" said Dan hurriedly. \"I am engaged to Miss Moon\nand we have just returned from the theatre to hear--to hear----\" He\ncaught sight of Moon's body seated in the desk-chair and drooping\nlimply over the table. \"Oh, it is true, then! He is dead. Good\nheavens! who murdered him?\"\n\n\"How do you know that Sir Charles has been murdered?\" asked the\nofficer sternly.\n\n\"Mr. Penn, the secretary, told me just now in the hall,\" said Dan,\nshaking himself free of the policeman. \"He blurted it out like a fool,\nand Miss Moon has fainted. Mrs. Bolstreath has taken her upstairs. But\nhow did it come about? Who found the body, and----\"\n\n\"I found the body,\" interrupted one of the other men, who was tall and\ncalm-faced, with a bald head and a heavy iron-gray moustache,\nperfectly clothed in fashionable evening-dress, and somewhat imperious\nin his manner of speaking. \"I had an appointment with Sir Charles at\nnine o'clock and came here to find him, as you now see him\"--he waved\nhis hand toward the desk--\"the doctor will tell you how he died.\"\n\n\"By poison,\" said the third man, who was dark, young, unobtrusive and\nretiring in manner. \"You see this deep scratch on the back of the\nneck. In that way the poison was administered. I take it that Sir\nCharles was bending over his desk and the person who committed the\ncrime scratched him with some very sharp instrument impregnated with\npoison.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Brown!\" gasped Dan, staring at the heavy, swollen body of his\nlate guardian, whom he had dined with in perfect health.\n\nThe three men glanced at one another as he said the name, and even the\npoliceman on guard at the door looked interested. The individual in\nuniform spoke with his cold eyes on Dan's agitated face. \"What do you\nknow of Mrs. Brown, Mr. Halliday?\" he demanded abruptly.\n\n\"Don't you know that a woman of that name called here?\"\n\n\"Yes. The secretary, Mr. Penn, told us that Miss Moon induced her\nfather to see a certain Mrs. Brown, who claimed that her son had been\ndrowned while working on one of the steamers owned by Sir Charles. You\nsaw her also, I believe?\"\n\n\"I was in the hall when Miss Moon went to induce her father to see the\npoor woman. That was about a quarter-past eight o'clock.\"\n\n\"And Mrs. Brown--as we have found from inquiry--left the house at a\nquarter to nine. Do you think she is guilty?\"\n\n\"I can't say. Didn't the footman see the body--that is if Mrs. Brown\ncommitted the crime--when he came to show her out? Sir Charles would\nnaturally ring his bell when the interview was over, and the footman\nwould come to conduct her to the door.\"\n\n\"Sir Charles never rang his bell!\" said the officer, drily. \"Mrs.\nBrown passed through the entrance hall at a quarter to nine o'clock,\nand mentioned to the footman--quite unnecessarily, I think--that Sir\nCharles had given her money. He let her out of the house. Naturally,\nthe footman not hearing any bell did not enter this room, nor--so far\nas any one else is concerned--did a single person. Only when Mr.\nDurwin----\"\n\n\"I came at nine o'clock,\" interrupted the baldheaded man imperiously,\n\"to keep my appointment. The footman told Mr. Penn, who took me to Sir\nCharles. He knocked but there was no answer, so he opened the door and\nwe saw this.\" He again waved his hands towards the body.\n\n\"Does Mr. Penn know nothing?\" asked Halliday, doubtfully.\n\n\"No,\" answered the other. \"Inspector Tenson has questioned him\ncarefully in my presence. Mr. Penn says that he brought Sir Charles\nhis spectacles from the dining-room before you left for the theatre\nwith the two ladies, and then was sent to his own room by his employer\nto write the usual letters. He remained there until nine o'clock when\nhe was called out to receive me, and we know that Mr. Penn speaks\ntruly, for the typewriting girl who was typing Sir Charles's letters\nto Mr. Penn's dictation, says that he did not leave the room all the\ntime.\n\n\"May I look at the body?\" asked Dan approaching the desk, and, on\nreceiving an affirmative reply from Durwin, bent over the dead.\n\nThe corpse was much swollen, the face indeed being greatly bloated,\nwhile the deep scratch on the nape of the neck looked venomous and\nangry. Yet it was a slight wound to bring about so great a\ncatastrophe, and the poison must have been very deadly and swift;\ndeadly because apparently Sir Charles had no time to move before it\ndid its work, and swift because he could not even have called for\nassistance, which he surely would have done had he been able to keep\nhis senses. Dan mentioned this to the watchful doctor, who nodded.\n\n\"I can't say for certain,\" he remarked cautiously, \"but I fancy that\nsnake-poison has been used. That will be seen to, when the post-mortem\nis made.\"\n\n\"And this fly?\" Halliday pointed to an insect which was just behind\nthe left ear of the dead man.\n\n\"Fly!\" echoed Inspector Tenson in surprise, and hastily advancing to\nlook. \"A fly in November. Impossible! Yet it is a fly, and dead. If\nnot,\" he swept the neck of the corpse with his curved hand, \"it would\nget away. H'm! Now I wonder what this means? Get me a magnifying\nglass.\"\n\nThere was not much difficulty in procuring one, as such an article lay\non the desk itself, being used, no doubt, by Sir Charles to aid his\nfailing sight when he examined important documents. Tenson inspected\nthe fly and removed it--took it to a near electric light and examined\nit. Then he came back and examined the place behind the left ear\nwhence he had removed it.\n\n\"It's been gummed on,\" he declared in surprise--a surprise which was\nalso visible in the faces of the other men; \"you can see the\nglistening spot on the skin, and the fly's legs are sticky.\" He\nbalanced the fly on his little finger as he spoke. \"I am sure they are\nsticky, although it is hard to say with such a small insect. However,\"\nhe carefully put away the fly in a silver matchbox, \"we'll have this\nexamined under a more powerful glass. You are all witnesses,\ngentlemen, that a fly was found near the wound which caused Sir\nCharles Moon's death.\"\n\n\"And the scent? What about the scent?\" Dan sniffed as he spoke and\nthen bent his nose to the dead man. \"It seems to come from his\nclothes.\"\n\n\"Scent!\" echoed Durwin sharply and sniffed. \"Yes, I observed that\nscent. But I did not take any notice of it.\"\n\n\"Nor did I,\" said the doctor. \"I noticed it also.\"\n\n\"And I,\" followed on the Inspector, \"and why should we take notice of\nit, Mr. Halliday? Many men use scent.\"\n\n\"Sir Charles never did,\" said Dan emphatically, \"he hated scents of\nall kinds even when women used them. He certainly would never have\nused them himself. I'll swear to that.\"\n\n\"Then this scent assumes importance.\" Durwin sniffed again, and held\nhis aquiline nose high. \"It is fainter now. But I smelt it very\nstrongly when I first came in and looked at the body. A strange\nperfume it is.\"\n\nThe three men tried to realize the peculiar odor of the scent, and\nbecame aware that it was rich and heavy and sickly, and somewhat\ndrowsy in its suggestion.\n\n\"A kind of thing to render a man sleepy,\" said Dan, musingly.\n\n\"Or insensible,\" said Inspector Tenson hastily, and put his nose to\nthe dead man's chin and mouth. He shook his head as he straightened\nhimself. \"I fancied from your observation, Mr. Halliday, that the\nscent might have been used as a kind of chloroform, but there's no\nsmell about the face. It comes from the clothes,\" he sniffed again,\n\"yes, it certainly comes from the clothes. Did you smell this scent on\nMrs. Brown?\" he demanded suddenly.\n\n\"No, I did not,\" admitted Halliday promptly, \"otherwise I should\ncertainly have noted it. I have a keen sense of smell. Mrs. Bolstreath\nand Lil--I mean Miss Moon--might have noticed it, however.\"\n\nAt that moment, as if in answer to her name, the door opened suddenly\nand Lillian brushed past the policeman in a headlong entrance into the\nlibrary. Her fair hair was in disorder, her face was bloodless, and\nher eyes were staring and wild. Behind her came Mrs. Bolstreath\nhurriedly, evidently trying to restrain her. But the girl would not be\nrestrained, and rushed forward scattering the small group round the\ndead, to fling herself on the body.\n\n\"Oh, father, father!\" she sobbed, burying her face on the shoulder of\nher dearly-loved parent. \"How awful it is. Oh, my heart will break.\nHow shall I ever get over it. Father! father! father!\"\n\nShe wept and wailed so violently that the four men were touched by her\ngreat grief. Both Mr. Durwin and Inspector Tenson had daughters of\ntheir own, while the young doctor was engaged. They could feel for her\nthoroughly, and no one made any attempt to remove her from the body\nuntil Mrs. Bolstreath stepped forward. \"Lillian, darling. Lillian, my\nchild,\" she said soothingly, and tried to lead the poor girl away.\n\nBut Lillian only clung closer to her beloved dead. \"No! No! Let me\nalone. I can't leave him. Poor, dear father--oh, I shall die!\"\n\n\"Dear,\" said Mrs. Bolstreath, raising her firmly but kindly, \"your\nfather is not there but in Heaven! Only the clay remains.\"\n\n\"It is all I have. And father was so good, so kind,--oh, who can have\nkilled him in this cruel way?\" She looked round with streaming eyes.\n\n\"We think that a Mrs. Brown--\" began the Inspector, only to be\nanswered by a loud cry from the distraught girl.\n\n\"Mrs. Brown! Then I have killed father! I have killed him! I persuaded\nhim to see the woman, because she was in trouble. And she killed\nhim--oh, the wretch--the--the--oh--oh! What had I done to her that she\nshould rob me of my dear, kind father?\" and she cried bitterly in her\nold friend's tender arms.\n\n\"Had you ever seen Mrs. Brown before?\" asked Durwin in his imperious\nvoice, although he lowered it in deference to her grief.\n\nLillian winced at the harsh sound. \"No, No! I never saw her before.\nHow could I have seen her before. She said that her son had been\ndrowned, and that she was poor. I asked father to help her, and he\ntold me he would. It's my fault that she saw my father and now\"--her\nvoice leaped an octave--\"he's dead. Oh--oh! my father--my father!\" and\nshe tried to break from Mrs. Bolstreath's arms to fling herself on the\ndead once more.\n\n\"Lillian darling, don't cry,\" said Dan, placing his hand on her\nshoulder.\n\n\"You have not lost the dearest and best of fathers!\" she sobbed\nviolently.\n\n\"Your loss is my loss,\" said Halliday in a voice of pain, \"but we must\nbe brave, both you and I.\" He associated himself with her so as to\ncalm her grief. \"It's not your fault that your dear father is dead.\"\n\n\"I persuaded him to see Mrs. Brown. And she--she--she----\"\n\n\"We can't say if this woman is guilty, as yet,\" said Durwin hastily,\n\"so do not blame yourself, Miss Moon. But did you smell any scent on\nthis Mrs. Brown?\"\n\nLillian looked at him vacantly and shook her head. Then she burst once\nmore into hard and painful sobbing, trying again to embrace the dead\nman.\n\n\"Don't ask her any questions, sir,\" said Halliday, in a low voice to\nMr. Durwin, \"you see she is not in a fit state to reply. Lillian,\" he\nraised her up from her knees and gently but firmly detached her arms\nfrom the dead. \"My darling, your father is past all earthly aid. We\ncan do nothing but avenge him. Go with Mrs. Bolstreath and lie down.\nWe must be firm.\"\n\n\"Firm! Firm!--and father dead!\" wailed Lillian. \"Oh, what a wretch\nthat Mrs. Brown must be to kill him. Kill her, Dan--oh, make her\nsuffer. My good, kind father, who--who--oh\"--she flung herself on\nDan's neck--\"take me away; take me away!\" and her lover promptly\ncarried her to the door.\n\nMrs. Bolstreath, who had been talking hurriedly to Inspector Tenson,\ncame after the pair and took the girl from Dan. \"She must lie down and\nhave a sleeping-draught,\" she said softly. \"If the doctor will\ncome----\"\n\nThe doctor was only too glad to come. He was a young man beginning to\npractise medicine in the neighborhood, and had been hurriedly summoned\nin default of an older physician. The chance of gaining a new and\nwealthy patient was too good to lose, so he quickly followed Mrs.\nBolstreath as she led the half-unconscious girl up the stairs. Dan\nclosed the door and returned to the Inspector and the official from\nScotland Yard. The former was speaking.\n\n\"Mrs. Bolstreath did not smell any perfume on Mrs. Brown,\" he was\nsaying, \"and ladies are very quick to notice such things. Miss Moon\nalso shook her head.\"\n\n\"I don't think Miss Moon was in a state of mind to understand what you\nwere saying, Mr. Inspector,\" said Halliday, drily. \"However, I am\nquite sure from my own observation that Mrs. Brown did not use the\nperfume. I would have noticed it at once, for I spotted it the moment\nI examined the body.\"\n\n\"So did I,\" said Durwin once more; \"but I thought Sir Charles might\nhave used it. You say he did not, therefore the scent is a clue.\"\n\n\"It does not lead to the indictment of Mrs. Brown, however, sir,\" said\nTenson thoughtfully, \"since she had no perfume of that sort about her.\nBut she must have killed Sir Charles, for she was the last person who\nsaw him alive.\"\n\n\"She may come forward and exonerate herself,\" suggested Dan after a\npause, \"or she may have left her address with Sir Charles.\"\n\n\"I have glanced through the papers on the desk and can find no\naddress,\" was the Inspector's reply; \"yet, if she gave it to him, it\nwould be there.\"\n\nDurwin meditated, then looked up. \"As she was the mother of the man in\nSir Charles's employment who was drowned,\" he said in his harsh voice,\nand now very official in his manner, \"in the offices of the company\nwho own the steamers--Sir Charles was a director and chief\nshareholder, I understand from his secretary, Mr. Penn--will be found\nthe drowned man's address, which will be that of his mother.\"\n\n\"But I can't see what motive Mrs. Brown had to murder Sir Charles,\"\nremarked Dan in a puzzled tone.\n\n\"We'll learn the motive when we find Mrs. Brown,\" said Tenson, who had\nmade a note of Durwin's suggestion. \"Many people think they have\ngrievances against the rich, and we know that the late Sir Charles was\na millionaire. He doubtless had enemies--dangerous enemies.\"\n\n\"Dangerous!\" The word recalled to Dan what Moon had said at the\ndinner-table when Lillian had playfully offered him a penny for his\nthoughts. \"Sir Charles at dinner said something about dangerous\npeople.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\" asked the Inspector and again opened his note-book.\n\nDan reported the conversation, which was not very satisfactory as Moon\nhad only spoken generally. Tenson noted down the few remarks, but did\nnot appear to think them important. Durwin, however, was struck by\nwhat had been said.\n\n\"Sir Charles asked me here to explain about a certain gang he believed\nwas in existence,\" he remarked.\n\n\"What's that, sir?\" asked the Inspector alertly. \"Did he tell you\nanything?\"\n\n\"Of course he didn't. How could he when he was dead when I arrived,\"\nretorted Durwin with a frown. \"He simply said that he wished to see me\nin my official capacity about some gang, but gave me no details. Those\nwere to be left until I called here. He preferred to see me here\ninstead of at my office for reasons which he declared he would state\nwhen we met in this room.\"\n\n\"Then you think that a gang----\"\n\n\"Mr. Inspector,\" interrupted Durwin, stiffly, \"I have told you all\nthat was said by the deceased. Whether the gang is dangerous, or what\nthe members do, or where they are, I cannot say. Have you examined\nthose windows?\" he asked suddenly, pointing to three French-windows at\nthe side of the room.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Tenson promptly, \"as soon as I entered the apartment I did\nso. They are all locked.\"\n\n\"And if they were not, no one would enter there,\" put in Dan quickly.\n\"Outside is a walled garden, and the wall is very high with broken\nbottles on top. I suppose, Mr. Durwin, you are thinking that some one\nmay have come in to kill Sir Charles between the time of Mrs. Brown's\ndeparture and your coming?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" assented the other sharply, \"if the perfume is a clue, Mrs.\nBrown must be innocent. Penn, as we know from the statement of the\ntypewriter girl, was in his room all the time, and the servants have\nfully accounted for themselves. We examined them all--the Inspector\nand I did, that is--when you were at the theatre,\" he waved his hand\nwith a shrug. \"Who can say who is guilty?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Tenson, snapping the elastic band round his note-book and\nputting it into his pocket, \"we have the evidence of the fly and of\nthe perfume.\"\n\n\"What do you think about the fly?\" asked Dan, staring.\n\n\"I don't know what to think. It is an artificial fly, exquisitely made\nand has been gummed on the dead man's neck behind the left ear. The\nassassin must have placed it there, since a man would scarcely do such\na silly thing himself. Why, it was placed there I can't say, any more\nthan I can guess why Sir Charles was murdered, or who murdered him.\nThe affair is a complete mystery, as you must admit.\"\n\nBefore the inquest and after the inquest, more people than the three\nmen who had held the discussion in the presence of the dead, admitted\nthat the affair was a mystery. In fact the evidence at the inquest\nonly plunged the matter into deeper gloom. Tenson, acting on Durwin's\nadvice, sought the office of the tramp-steamer company--The Universal\nCarrier Line--in which the late Sir Charles was chief shareholder and\ndirector, to learn without any difficulty the whereabouts of Mrs.\nBrown, the mother of the drowned man. She proved to be an entirely\ndifferent person to the woman who had given the name on the fatal\nnight, being lean instead of stout, comparatively young instead of\nold, and rather handsome in an elderly way in place of being wrinkled\nand worn with grief. She declared that she had never been near Moon's\nhouse on the night of the murder, or on any other night. Mrs.\nBolstreath, Lillian, the footman, and Dan all swore that she was not\nthe Mrs. Brown who had sought the interview with Sir Charles.\nTherefore it was argued by every one that Mrs. Brown, taking a false\nname and telling a false story, must have come to see Moon with the\ndeliberate intention of murdering him. Search was made for her, but\nshe could not be found. From the moment she passed out of the front\ndoor she had vanished, and although a description was published of her\nappearance, and a reward was offered for her apprehension no one came\nforward to claim it. Guilty or innocent, she was invisible.\n\nInspector Tenson did not speak at the inquest of the gang about which\nSir Charles had intended to converse with Mr. Durwin, as it did not\nseem to have any bearing on the case. Also, as Durwin suggested, if it\nhad any bearing it was best to keep the matter quiet until more\nevidence was forthcoming to show that such a gang--whatever its\nbusiness was--existed. Then the strange episode of the fly was\nsuppressed for the same reason. Privately, Tenson informed Dan that he\nwould not be surprised to learn that there was a gang of murderers in\nexistence whose sign-manual was a fly, real or artificial, and\ninstanced another gang, which had been broken up some years\npreviously, who always impressed the figure of a purple fern on their\nvictim. But the whole idea, said Tenson, was so vague that he thought\nit best to suppress the fact of the artificial fly on the dead man's\nneck. \"If there's anything in it,\" finished the Inspector, \"there's\nsure to be other murders committed, and the fly placed on the victim.\nWe'll wait and see, and if a second case occurs we'll be sure that\nsuch a gang exists and will collar the beasts. Best to say nothing,\nMr. Halliday.\"\n\nSo he said nothing, and Dan said nothing, and Durwin, who approved of\nthe necessary secrecy, held his tongue. Of course there was a lot of\ntalk and many theories as to who had murdered the millionaire, and why\nhe had been murdered in so ingenious a manner. The postmortem\nexamination proved that Moon had died of snake-poison administered\nthrough the scratch on the neck, and the circumstantial evidence at\nthe inquest went to show that he must have been taken unawares, while\nbending over his desk. Some people thought that Mrs. Brown was\ninnocent because of the absence of the perfume; others declared she\nmust be guilty on account of her false name and false story, and the\nfact that Moon was found dead a quarter of an hour after she left the\nhouse. No doubt the circumstantial evidence was very strong, but it\ncould not be said positively that the woman was guilty, even though\nshe did not appear to defend her character.\n\nSo the jury thought, for they brought in the only possible verdict\ntwelve good and lawful men could bring in: \"Wilful murder against some\nperson or persons unknown,\" and there the matter ended for sheer want\nof further evidence. The affair was a mystery and a mystery it\nremained.\n\n\"And will until the Day of Judgment!\" said Tenson, finally.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nDUTY BEFORE PLEASURE\n\n\nThe year ended sadly for Lillian, since she had lost her father, her\nlover, and her home; gaining instead the doubtful companionship of a\npaternal uncle, who stepped into the position of guardian. The girl,\nalthough she did not know it at the time, was leaving a pleasant\nflowery lane to turn into a flinty high road, arched by a dismal sky.\nIt is true that she still possessed Mrs. Bolstreath to comfort her,\nbut the loss of Dan could scarcely be compensated by the attentions of\nthe chaperon. Not that Halliday was altogether lost; but he had been\npushed out of her life by Sir John Moon, who approved as little of\nthis suitor as the late baronet had done.\n\n\"You see, my dear child,\" he exclaimed to Lillian, immediately after\nthe New Year and when things were more restful, \"as your guardian and\nuncle, I have to see that you make a good match.\"\n\n\"What is marriage without love?\" queried Miss Moon scornfully.\n\n\"Love!\" Sir John shrugged his elegant shoulders and sneered. \"Love is\nall very well, but a title is better. I say nothing about money, as\nyou have any amount of that useful article. Now, Lord Curberry----\"\n\n\"I detest Lord Curberry, and I shan't marry Lord Curberry,\"\ninterrupted Lillian, frowning, and her mind held a picture of the\nlean, ascetic peer with the cruel, grey eyes. As a barrister, Curberry\nwas no doubt admirable; as a nobleman, he filled his new position very\nwell; but she could not see him as a lover, try as she might. Not that\nshe did try, for under no conditions and under no pressure did she\nintend to become his wife.\n\n\"Your father wished you to marry Lord Curberry,\" hinted Uncle John\nsoftly.\n\n\"My father wished me to be happy,\" cried Lillian hotly, \"and I can't\nbe happy unless I marry Dan.\"\n\n\"That aviator man! Pooh! He has nothing to give you.\"\n\n\"He gives himself, and that is all I want.\"\n\n\"I see. Love in a cottage and----\"\n\nLillian interrupted again. \"There's no need for love in a cottage. I\nhave plenty of money; you said as much yourself, Uncle John.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said the new baronet gravely, \"from what I saw of young\nHalliday he is too proud \n", "final_result_str": "repair", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "42b8e5d2-7e4d-43f9-a2c4-7ba5e1f5fffc", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "正常小说"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "493f1f13-2e17-4003-aaec-aa08fbec9ea4", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "need_repair", "evidence": "前置格式性内容书籍"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "cd5c1f98-f2e8-401c-a5ef-0247d9c0a1ff", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "文章"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "6641ef3b-d0d3-4864-b5de-2ed1bf31fb90", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 逻辑：对话有关联"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

The images from the moved lens are combined to form panoramic scene. Another approach is to form an array of multiple different camera lenses and to combine the image results captured by the array of lenses into a single image. Still another is to utilize an ultra-wide angle lens (e.g., a fish-eye lens) to capture a scene with a wider-than-normal field of view. Yet another is to use a panoramic optical device to create a 360 degree horizontal field of view using a single shot (a discrete point of time using a single lens). This later approach is sometimes referred to as a “one-shot” panoramic device, which captures a panoramic scene in a single point in time using a single lens. Each of these approaches has benefits and drawbacks depending on use cases.\nWithin one-shot solutions that use panoramic optical components, a number of approaches have been taken depending on situation. Frequently, these components permit a single 360 degree image of an environment to be captured. Traditional panoramic one shot cameras place an inverted curved reflective surface in front of an image sensor, to reflect light before directing it to an image sensor.

In normal cells, autophagy is used to remove superfluous and damaged organelles and cytosolic proteins for degradation, serving as a surveillance mechanism and a survival strategy to maintain cell viability under stress conditions \\[[3](#CIT0003),[4](#CIT0004)\\]. Disruption of autophagy is involved in diverse human diseases \\[[5](#CIT0005),[6](#CIT0006)\\]. In cancer progression, autophagy plays dual roles, either as a tumor suppressor or promoting tumor progression \\[[7](#CIT0007)\\].\n\nVarious proteins participate in autophagy. BECN1 is a coiled-coil protein that interacts with BCL2 and is also a central component of the BECN1-PIK3C3-PIK3R4 complex which is indispensable for autophagy induction \\[[1](#CIT0001)\\]. BECN1 consists of 3 domains: BH3, coiled-coil domain (CCD) and BARA (the latter includes the ECD), and the roles of BECN1 in autophagy initiation depend on the proteins that bind to these domains \\[[1](#CIT0001),[8](#CIT0008)\\]. For example, the class Ⅲ phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) interacts with the CCD and ECD to form a complex with BECN1 \\[[9](#CIT0009)\\]. This complex increases the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) that favors phagophore elongation and allows the recruitment of ATG proteins to the phagophore \\[[1](#CIT0001)\\]. Thus, exploring the regulation mechanisms of BECN1 is important for us to reveal the mysteries of autophagy and its functions in human diseases.\n\nThe RBCC/TRIM (tripartite motif) proteins is a large family that contains an N-terminal ring domain, 1 or 2 B-box domains and a CCD \\[[10](#CIT0010)\\]. TRIM proteins participate in multiple cellular processes including cell proliferation, transcriptional regulation, immunity and cancer progression \\[[11](#CIT0011)--[14](#CIT0014)\\]. A series of studies indicated that many TRIM proteins are linked to autophagy \\[[15](#CIT0015)--[27](#CIT0027)\\]. Recently, several studies demonstrated that TRIM proteins can act as both autophagy cargo receptors and platforms assembling autophagosome-formation machinery. These TRIMs recruit ULK1 and BECN1 complexes and bind to mammalian Atg8-family paralogs via an LC3-interacting region, while recognizing cargo through the SPRY and potentially other domains \\[[26](#CIT0026),[27](#CIT0027)\\]. In our previous studies, we explored the potential roles of TRIM proteins in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by the mRNA expression profiling of all TRIM proteins in NSCLC cells \\[[28](#CIT0028)\\]. We identified TRIM59 as a potential tumor-promoting gene, but the precise molecular mechanism was obscure. TRIM59 has been reported to have oncogenic activity in mouse models and can be used as a multiple tumor marker for detecting early tumorigenesis \\[[29](#CIT0029),[30](#CIT0030)\\]. In gastric tumors, TRIM59 promotes gastric carcinogenesis through ubiquitinating and degrading TP53 \\[[11](#CIT0011)\\]. However, the role of TRIM59 in regulating autophagy has not been studied yet. In this study, we found an unexpected role of TRIM59 in autophagy regulation. The expression of TRIM59 was reciprocally correlated with BECN1 expression in NSCLC, and TRIM59 knockdown significantly increased the basal levels of autophagy in NSCLC cells. We discovered that TRIM59 could affect the transcription of the *BECN1* gene by negatively regulating the NFKB pathway. What is more intriguing was that TRIM59 could also regulate autophagy initiation through modulating TRAF6-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1. TRIM59 overexpression significantly reduced the TRAF6-induced ubiquitination of BECN1 and disturbed the formation of the BECN1-PIK3C3-PIK3R4 complex, whereas TRIM59 knockdown had an opposite effect. Further studies demonstrated that TRIM59 could directly ubiquitinate TRAF6 in a K48-linkage for proteasomal degradation. Thus, our studies point out a new role of TRIM59 in NSCLC cells and elucidate a novel mechanism of autophagy regulation.\n\nResults {#S0002}\n=======\n\nTRIM59 knockdown induces autophagy {#S0002-S2001}\n----------------------------------\n\nIn our previous study, we demonstrated that TRIM59 promoted the growth of non-small cell lung cancer \\[[28](#CIT0028)\\]. Here, we found an interesting phenomenon that the protein expression level of TRIM59 was inversely related to that of BECN1, an autophagy-related protein, in NSCLC tissues and cancer cells ([Figure 1(a, b)](#F0001)). This prompted us to explore if TRIM59 could affect autophagy. To detect the formation of autophagosomes, we transfected a plasmid encoding MAP1LC3B/LC3B (microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta) fused with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) into H1299 cells. As can be seen from [Figure 1c](#F0001) left panel, the GFP-LC3B puncta were significantly increased when TRIM59 was knocked down. The percentage of the cells with GFP-LC3B puncta increased significantly in TRIM59 knockdown cells compared with control H1299 cells ([Figure 1(c](#F0001)), right panel).10.1080/15548627.2018.1491493-F0001Figure 1.Knocking down TRIM59 induces autophagy. (**a**) Western blot analysis of the expression levels of BECN1 and TRIM59 in NSCLC tissues (top panel). BECN1 and TRIM59 expression relative to ACTB were quantified.

BECN1 and TRIM59 expression relative to ACTB were quantified. Data represents the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD) (bottom panel). (**c**) H1299 cells stably expressing pEGFP-C2-LC3B (GFP-LC3B) were transiently transfected with *TRIM59* siRNAs. After 42 h, the cells were treated with or without 20 μM chloroquine (CQ) for 6 h and then analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus IX83). Scale bar: 10 μm (left panel). The cell numbers with GFP-LC3B puncta were counted under 200× magnification. \\*\\**P *≤ 0.01 (right panel). (**d**) TRIM59 was knocked down in H1299 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3B and treated with or without 20 μM chloroquine (CQ) for 6 h. The autophagy-related proteins were analyzed using the indicated antibodies.\n\nWe next assessed the expression levels of LC3-II and SQSTM1/p62 in TRIM59-silenced cells. As expected, the expression of the autophagosome-associated lipidated form, LC3-II, increased and the expression of SQSTM1 decreased when TRIM59 was knocked down ([Figure 1(d](#F0001))). As we know, autophagy is a highly dynamic process, and the accumulation of autophagosomes and LC3-II levels can be caused by either the induction of autophagy or the inhibition of autophagic flux \\[[31](#CIT0031)\\]. In order to discriminate between the 2 distinct mechanisms in our study, we used the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) to treat cells. As can be seen in [Figure 1(c](#F0001)), the percentage of the cells with LC3B puncta significantly increased when treated with CQ in both control and TRIM59-silenced cells. The expression of LC3-II also increased remarkably following CQ treatment compared with the CQ untreated group ([Figure 1(d](#F0001))). These data proved that TRIM59 knockdown promoted autophagy induction, not autophagy inhibition.\n\nTRIM59 affects the transcription of BECN1 through regulating the NFKB pathway {#S0002-S2002}\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs the expression of BECN1 was reciprocally correlated with TRIM59 ([Figure 1(a, b)](#F0001)), we presumed that TRIM59 affected autophagy by regulating the expression of BECN1. With the increasing expression of exogenous TRIM59 in H1299 cells, the expression of BECN1 decreased in a concentration dependent manner ([Figure 2(a](#F0002))). We next examined the effects of TRIM59 on the mRNA level of *BECN1*. Overexpression of TRIM59 decreased the *BECN1* mRNA level, and knocking down TRIM59 significantly increased the mRNA level of *BECN1* ([Figure 2(b, c)](#F0002)). These results indicated that TRIM59 might regulate the transcription of *BECN1*. We generated constructs with different fragments of the *BECN1* promoter region in the pGL3-enhancer vector and then performed a luciferase activity assay. From [Figure 2d](#F0002), we found that the promoter fragments + 1000 to −934 and + 500 to −934 showed higher activity than the others. We then detected the effects of TRIM59 on the activity of these promoter fragments. Overexpression of TRIM59 reduced the promoter activity of the + 1000 to −934 and + 500 to −934 fragments, whereas the + 1 to −934 and −500 to −934 fragments remained unchanged ([Figure 2(e](#F0002))). These results proved that the promoter region containing + 500 to + 1 might be important for TRIM59 to regulate the transcription of *BECN1*.10.1080/15548627.2018.1491493-F0002Figure 2.TRIM59 affects the transcription of *BECN1*. (**a**) H1299 cells were transfected with pCMV-HA-*TRIM59* (HA-*TRIM59*) with a gradual increase in the amounts of the plasmids. The expressions of BECN1 and exogenous TRIM59 were detected by western blot using anti-BECN1 and anti-HA antibodies. The BECN1 intensity was calculated by normalizing against ACTB. (**b**) The mRNA expression of *BECN1* and *TRIM59* in control and TRIM59-overexpressing conditions were determined by Q-PCR. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD).

The relative levels of luciferase activity were normalized to the levels of the + 1000 to −934 fragment and to the levels of luciferase activity of the Renilla control plasmid. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD). (**e**) pGL3-enhancer vectors containing different fragments of the *BECN1* promoter were transfected into H1299 cells, co-transfected with Renilla control plasmid and HA-*TRIM59* or empty vector. The relative levels of luciferase activity were normalized to the levels of the vector control and to the levels of luciferase activity of the Renilla control plasmid. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD). (**f**) pGL3-enhancer vector containing the + 500 to −130 region of the *BECN1* promoter were transfected into H1299 cells, co-transfected with Renilla control plasmid and pCMV-HA-*TRIM59* plasmid. The relative levels of luciferase activity were normalized to the levels of vector control and to the levels of luciferase activity of the Renilla control plasmid. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD). (**g**) pGL3-enhancer vector containing the + 500 to −130 region of the *BECN1* promoter were transfected into H1299 cells, co-transfected with Renilla control plasmid and control siRNA or *TRIM59* siRNAs. The relative levels of luciferase activity were normalized to the levels of control siRNA and to the levels of luciferase activity of the Renilla control plasmid. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD). (**h**) pGL3-enhancer vector containing the + 500 to −130 region of the *BECN1* promoter was transfected into H1299 cells, co-transfected with Renilla control plasmid and pcDNA3.0-*RELA* plasmid. The relative levels of luciferase activity were normalized to the levels of vector control and to the levels of luciferase activity of the Renilla control plasmid. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD). (**i**) pGL3-enhancer vector containing the + 500 to −130 region of the *BECN1* promoter was transfected into H1299 cells, co-transfected with Renilla control plasmid and control siRNA or *RELA* siRNAs. The relative levels of luciferase activity were normalized to the levels of control siRNA and to the levels of luciferase activity of the Renilla control plasmid. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD). (**j**) The pCMV-HA-*TRIM59* plasmid was transfected into H1299 cells. After 48 h, the expression of the indicated proteins was determined by western blot. The BECN1 intensity was calculated by normalizing against ACTB. (**k**) The control siRNA or *TRIM59* siRNAs were transfected into H1299 cells. After 48 h, the expression of the indicated proteins was determined by western blot. The BECN1 intensity was calculated by normalizing against ACTB.\n\nWe next inserted the promoter region containing + 500 to −130 into the pGL3-enhancer vector and performed a luciferase activity assay in TRIM59-overexpressing and TRIM59-silenced conditions. [Figure 2f](#F0002) and g show that the activity of this promoter region was sensitive to the expression level of TRIM59. The activity of this promoter fragment decreased when TRIM59 was overexpressed and increased when TRIM59 was knocked down. These results confirmed that TRIM59 regulated the transcription of *BECN1* through the + 500 to + 1 region of the *BECN1* promoter.\n\nBecause TRIM59 is not a transcription factor, we presumed that TRIM59 regulated the transcription of *BECN1* through modulating the activity of a certain transcription factor. By analysis of the promoter region in + 500 to + 1, we identified a RELA/p65 (a key subunit of NFKB) binding site: GGGGATTTCC, located in + 317 to + 308. We next detected the promoter activity of the + 500 to −130 fragment by modulating the expression of RELA. The promoter activity increased remarkably when RELA was overexpressed and decreased when RELA was knocked down ([Figure 2(h](#F0002), i)). Overexpressing RELA promoted the expression of BECN1, and knocking down RELA reduced the expression of BECN1 (Fig. S1A-S1D). These results demonstrated that RELA could regulate the transcription of *BECN1*. A similar result was also reported by Copetti *et al*. in 2009 \\[[32](#CIT0032)\\].\n\nWe next detected the effects of TRIM59 on the NFKB pathway and autophagy. Overexpression of TRIM59 blocked the activation of the NFKB pathway, as can be seen from the reduced expression of phosphorylated RELA and phosphorylated NFKBIA. ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) is an important regulator in the autophagy pathway, and the phosphorylation of ULK1 at Ser757 is closely related to the repression of autophagy induction \\[[33](#CIT0033)\\]. TRIM59 overexpression increased the expression of p-ULK1 (Ser757) and decreased the expression of LC3-II, indicating the repression of autophagy ([Figure 2(j](#F0002))), whereas TRIM59 knockdown activated the NFKB pathway and induced autophagy ([Figure 2(k](#F0002))). According to these results, we demonstrated that TRIM59 could affect the transcription of *BECN1* through regulating the NFKB pathway, and thus affected autophagy.\n\nTRIM59 affects the ubiquitination level of BECN1 {#S0002-S2003}\n------------------------------------------------\n\nAs TRIM59 possessed E3 ligase function \\[[11](#CIT0011)\\], we examined if TRIM59 could affect the stability of the BECN1 protein. We first tested the stability of BECN1 in physiological conditions by adding cycloheximide (CHX) to block protein translation in H1299 cells. The protein level of BECN1 decreased significantly when cells were treated with CHX for 6 h and this effect could be recovered by adding MG132, a proteasomal inhibitor, but not the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) ([Figure 3(a, b)](#F0003)). These results indicated that BECN1 was degraded via a proteasomal degradation pathway. To determine whether TRIM59 regulates the stability of BECN1, we examined the protein levels of BECN1 in the presence of CHX under TRIM59-overexpressing or -silenced conditions. [Figure 3c](#F0003) and d showed that TRIM59 did not affect the stability of BECN1. We next detected whether the ubiquitination of BECN1 was affected by TRIM59. Unexpectedly, the ubiquitination level of BECN1 was inversely related to TRIM59 expression levels. Knocking down TRIM59 remarkably increased the ubiquitination level of BECN1 and overexpressing TRIM59 had an opposite effect ([Figure (3e, f](#F0003)) and Fig. S2A, S2B). From these results, we concluded that TRIM59 did not affect the stability of the BECN1 protein through a proteasomal degradation pathway. However, TRIM59 strongly affected the ubiquitination level of BECN1 and these changes in ubiqutination did not influence the stability of the BECN1 protein.10.1080/15548627.2018.1491493-F0003Figure 3.TRIM59 affects the ubiquitination of BECN1. (**a**) H1299 cells were treated with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) for different times and the expression of BECN1 was detected by western blot (left panel). BECN1 expression relative to ACTB was quantified. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD) (right panel). (**b**) H1299 cells were treated with 25 μg/ml CHX alone or 25 μg/ml CHX plus 20 μM MG132 or 25 μg/ml CHX plus 20 μM chloroquine (CQ) for 9 h.

(**c**) H1299 cells were transfected with HA-*TRIM59*, treated with 25 μg/ml CHX for different time points and then immunoblotted with antibodies against HA, BECN1 and ACTB.

Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD) (right panel). (**d**) H1299 cells were transfected with control or *TRIM59* siRNA, treated with 25 μg/ml CHX for different time points and then immunoblotted with antibodies against TRIM59, BECN1 and ACTB.

Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD) (right panel). (**e**) H1299 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding HA-*BECN1*, His-*UB* and with or without tGFP-*TRIM59*. After 42 h, the cells were treated with or without MG132 for 6 h. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody. The ubiquitination was detected using anti-UB antibody. Exogenous BECN1 and TRIM59 were detected using anti-HA and anti-tGFP antibodies. (**f**) H1299 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding HA-*BECN1*, His-*UB* and with or without *TRIM59* siRNA. After 42 h, the cells were treated with or without MG132 for 6 h. Then, proteins were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody, and the ubiquitination was detected using anti-UB antibody. The exogenous BECN1 and endogenous TRIM59 were detected using anti-HA and anti-TRIM59 antibodies.\n\nTRIM59 affects traf6-mediated ubiquitination of BECN1 {#S0002-S2004}\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that upregulating K63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1 promotes autophagy \\[[34](#CIT0034)\\]. According to our previous results in [Figure 3e and f](#F0003), we supposed that TRIM59 might also regulate autophagy through modifying K63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1. To test this hypothesis, we used a K63R mutant of ubiquitin to test its effects on the ubiquitination of BECN1 when TRIM59 was knocked down. [Figure 4a](#F0004) showed that the increased ubiquitination of BECN1 induced by TRIM59 knockdown was not observed when the wild-type ubiquitin was replaced with the K63R mutant. We used an antibody specific for K63-linked ubiquitin for western blot. The results revealed that TRIM59 knockdown significantly increased the K63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1 ([Figure 4(b](#F0004))). TRAF6 was reported to directly ubiquitinate BECN1 through a K63 linkage \\[[34](#CIT0034)\\]. In H1299 cells, we found that TRAF6 could bind to BECN1 ([Figure 4(c](#F0004))). Thus, we examined if TRIM59 affected TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination. We found that overexpression of TRAF6 increased the ubiquitination of BECN1, and overexpression of TRIM59 remarkably reduced the TRAF6-induced ubiquitination ([Figure 4(d](#F0004))). These results indicated that, except for the influence on the transcription of *BECN1*, TRIM59 might also affect autophagy through interfering with TRAF6 mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1.10.1080/15548627.2018.1491493-F0004Figure 4.TRIM59 inhibits TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination of BECN1. (**a**) H1299 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding His-*UB* or His-*UB-K63R*, HA-*BECN1* and either *TRIM59* siRNA or control siRNA. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody, and the ubiquitination was detected using an antibody specifically targeting ubiquitin. Exogenous BECN1 was detected using anti-HA antibody. Endogenous TRIM59 was detected using anti-TRIM59 antibody. (**b**) H1299 cells were co-transfected with His-*UB*, HA-*BECN1* and either *TRIM59* siRNA or control siRNA. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody and the K63 linked ubiquitination was detected using an antibody specifically targeting ubiquitin that was K63 linked. (**c**) H1299 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-*TRAF6* and either HA-*BECN1* or empty vector. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody and blotted with anti-HA or anti-GFP antibodies. (**d**) 293T cells were co-transfected with the indicated plasmids. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody, and the ubiquitination was detected using an antibody specifically targeting ubiquitin. Exogenous BECN1, TRIM59 and TRAF6 were detected using anti-HA, anti-tGFP and anti-GFP antibodies. (**e**) H1299 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3B were co-transfected with pCMV-HA-*TRAF6* (HA-*TRAF6*) and either pCMV-HA-*TRIM59* (HA-*TRIM59*) or empty vector. After 48 h, the cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus IX83). Scale bar: 10 μm (left panel). The cell numbers with GFP-LC3B puncta were counted under 200× magnification. \\**P *≤ 0.05, \\*\\**P *≤ 0.01 (right panel). (**f**) H1299 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3B were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding HA-*TRAF6* and either HA-*TRIM59* or empty vector. After 46 h, the cells were treated with or without 20 μM chloroquine (CQ) for 2 h. The autophagy-related proteins were analyzed by western blot. (**g**) H1299 cells were co-transfected with the indicated exogenous genes and siRNAs. After 48 h, the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with HA antibody. FLAG-PIK3C3 and HA-BECN1 were detected using anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies. TRIM59 was detected using anti-TRIM59 antibody. (**h**) 293T cells were co-transfected with HA-*BECN1* and the indicated exogenous genes. Two days later, the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with HA antibody. FLAG-PIK3C3 and HA-BECN1 were detected using anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies. GFP-TRAF6 and tGFP-TRIM59 were detected with anti-GFP and anti-tGFP antibodies.\n\nWe wondered whether TRIM59-regulated TRAF6 induced autophagy. H1299 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3B were transfected with a plasmid encoding HA-*TRAF6* alone or co-transfected with HA-*TRAF6*- and HA-*TRIM59*-encoding plasmids. The autophagy induced by TRAF6 overexpression was greatly prohibited by TRIM59 overexpression. The cell numbers with GFP-LC3B puncta were increased when transfecting with a *TRAF6* plasmid alone, whereas a significant reduction was observed when the cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding *TRAF6* and *TRIM59* ([Figure 4(e](#F0004))). Overexpression of TRIM59 also decreased the expression of LC3B-II, whereas it increased SQSTM1 expression compared with overexpression of TRAF6 alone ([Figure 4(f](#F0004))).\n\nBECN1 plays a central role in autophagy through participating in the formation of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) complex \\[[1](#CIT0001)\\]. PIK3C3 is the catalytic subunit of PtdIns3K and interacts with BECN1 to form a complex when autophagy is induced. As TRIM59 could affect autophagy by modifying the ubiquitination of BECN1, we tested the effects of TRIM59 on the formation of the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex. From [Figure 4g](#F0004), we could see that TRIM59 knockdown enhanced the interaction between BECN1 and PIK3C3. However, overexpression of TRIM59 significantly reduced the PIK3C3 protein levels precipitated by HA-BECN1 and this effect was recovered by TRAF6 overexpression ([Figure 4h](#F0004)). These results demonstrated that TRIM59 could also affect autophagy through regulating the TRAF6-induced K63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1, thus modulating the formation of the PtdIns3K complex.\n\nTRIM59 regulates the degradation of TRAF6 by ubiquitination {#S0002-S2005}\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe already proved that TRIM59 could interfere with the E3 ubiquitin ligase function of TRAF6. An important question that needed to be answered was how TRIM59 regulated TRAF6. As shown in [Figure 5a](#F0005), knocking down TRIM59 apparently increased the expression of TRAF6. When the expression of exogenous TRIM59 increased, the expression of TRAF6 decreased in a concentration-dependent manner ([Figure 5(b](#F0005))). To investigate if TRIM59 affected the stability of TRAF6, we detected the stability of TRAF6 protein in physiological conditions by adding CHX for different times in H1299 cells. The expression of TRAF6 decreased significantly when treated with CHX for 3 h ([Figure 5(c](#F0005))) and the decreased expression of TRAF6 could be recovered by adding MG132, but not CQ (Fig. S3A). This observation indicated that TRAF6 protein was degraded in a proteasomal degradation pathway.10.1080/15548627.2018.1491493-F0005Figure 5.TRIM59 regulates the degradation of TRAF6 by ubiquitination. (**a**) TRIM59 was knocked down in H1299 cells and protein expression was detected using the indicated antibodies. (**b**) H1299 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding HA-*TRIM59* with gradually increasing the amount of the plasmid. The expression of TRAF6 and TRIM59 was detected by western blot using anti-TRAF6 and anti-HA antibodies. (**c**) H1299 cells were treated with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) for different times and the TRAF6 expression was detected by western blot (left panel).

(**d**) H1299 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding HA-*TRIM59*, treated with 25 μg/ml CHX for different time points and then immunoblotted with antibodies against HA, TRAF6 and ACTB (left panel).

(**e**) H1299 cells were transfected with control or *TRIM59* siRNA, treated with 25 μg/ml CHX for different time points and then immunoblotted with antibodies against TRIM59, TRAF6 and ACTB (left panel).

(**f**) H1299 cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding HA-*TRAF6* and either tGFP-*TRIM59* or empty vector. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody and blotted with HA and tGFP antibodies. (**g**) The lysate of H1299 cells was immunoprecipitated using TRAF6 antibody or normal rabbit IgG, and blotted with TRAF6 and TRIM59 antibodies. (**h**) GST-TRIM59 purified with glutathione Sepharose beads was incubated with extracts from HA-TRAF6-transfected 293T cells. Western blot was performed to detect the indicated proteins using anti-HA and anti-GST antibodies. (**i**) H1299 cells were transfected with *TRIM59* siRNAs. After 42 h, the cells were treated with MG132 for 6 h. The lysates were immunoprecipitated using TRAF6 antibody and blotted with the indicated antibodies. (**j**) H1299 cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding His-*UB*, HA-*TRAF6* and either tGFP-*TRIM59* or empty vector. After 42 h, the cells were treated with or without MG132 for 6 h. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody. The ubiquitination was detected using an antibody specific for ubiquitin, and TRAF6 and TRIM59 were detected using anti-HA and anti-tGFP antibodies. (**k**) H1299 cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding His-*UB*, HA-*TRAF6* and either tGFP-*TRIM59* or empty vector. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody. The K48-linked ubiquitination was detected using an antibody specifically targeting ubiquitin that was K48 linked. TRAF6 and TRIM59 were detected using anti-HA and anti-tGFP antibodies. (**l**) The purified GST-TRIM59 was incubated with the indicated reaction component. The reaction mixture was subjected to western blot using antibodies against ubiquitin, Flag and GST.\n\nTo determine whether TRIM59 regulates the stability of TRAF6, we examined the protein levels of TRAF6 in the presence of CHX under TRIM59-overexpressing or -silenced conditions. [Figure 5d](#F0005) and e show that overexpression of TRIM59 accelerated the degradation rate of TRAF6, whereas knocking down TRIM59 stabilized the protein level of TRAF6. In order to figure out if TRIM59 could interacted with TRAF6, we performed co-immunoprecipitation and GST affinity isolation experiments and found that TRIM59 could bind to TRAF6 ([Figure 5(f](#F0005)-h) and Fig. S3B). As TRIM59 has an E3 ubiquitin ligase function, we detected the effect of TRIM59 on the ubiquitination of TRAF6. [Figure 5i](#F0005) showed that TRIM59 knockdown reduced the ubiquitination level of endogenous TRAF6. Overexpression of TRIM59 increased the ubiquitination level of TRAF6, whereas it decreased the protein expression of TRAF6, indicating the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of TRAF6 ([Figure 5j](#F0005)).\n\nTRAF6 was reported to possess both K48-linked and K63-linked ubiquitination \\[[35](#CIT0035)--[39](#CIT0039)\\], we next used ubiquitin mutants specific for K48 (K48R) or K63 (K63R) to check the changes in the ubiquitination level of TRAF6 induced by TRIM59. The increased ubiquitination levels of TRAF6 induced by TRIM59 overexpression was not observed when transfecting with a plasmid encoding the K48R mutant; however, the increased ubiquitination levels of TRAF6 could still be observed when transfecting with a plasmid encoding the K63R mutant, indicating that TRIM59 induced a K48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6 (Fig. S4A, S4B). We further examined these results using an antibody specific for K48-linked ubiquitination. [Figure 5k](#F0005) showed that the enhanced ubiquitination of TRAF6 induced by TRIM59 was indeed K48-linked. To provide evidence that TRIM59 directly ubiquitinated TRAF6, we performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay. As can be seen in [Figure 5l](#F0005), the polyubiquitin bands were observed when purified TRAF6 was added to the reaction system containing ubiquitin, UBA1/UBE1, UBE2D1, ATP and TRIM59. All these results pointed out that TRIM59 could directly regulate the degradation of TRAF6 in a ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation process.\n\nAs TRAF6 was originally described as an important regulator for the NFKB pathway \\[[40](#CIT0040),[41](#CIT0041)\\], we wanted to explore if the inhibition of BECN1 expression was also dependent on TRAF6 degradation induced by TRIM59. Figure S5A and S5B show that TRAF6 overexpression could not rescue the reduction of both the mRNA and protein level of *BECN1/*BECN1 triggered by TRIM59. These results demonstrated that TRIM59 affected the expression of BECN1 though a TRAF6-independent NFKB pathway.\n\nThe ring domain of TRIM59 is important for regulating traf6-induced autophagy {#S0002-S2006}\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe ring domain of TRIM family proteins has been shown to be essential for their protein degradation function \\[[10](#CIT0010),[11](#CIT0011)\\]. To get further insight into the mechanism for TRIM59 to ubiquitinate TRAF6, we constructed a TRIM59 mutant lacking the ring domain (ΔR). We found that this mutant could still interact with TRAF6 ([Figure 6(a](#F0006)[)]{.ul}). However, the mutant lost the ability to destabilize the TRAF6 protein ([Figure 6(b](#F0006))). Besides, the ability to ubiquitinate TRAF6 was also abolished ([Figure 6(c](#F0006))). These findings demonstrated that the ring domain of TRIM59 was important for the degradation of TRAF6.10.1080/15548627.2018.1491493-F0006Figure 6.The ring domain of TRIM59 is important for regulating TRAF6-induced autophagy. (**a**) H1299 cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding GFP-*TRAF6* and HA-*ΔR*. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody or normal mouse IgG, and blotted with HA and GFP antibodies. (**b**) H1299 cells were transfected with HA-*ΔR*, treated with 25 μg/ml CHX for different time points and then immunoblotted with antibodies against HA, TRAF6 and ACTB (left panel). TRAF6 expression relative to ACTB was quantified. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments (mean± SD) (right panel). (**c**) H1299 cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding His-*UB*, HA-*TRAF6* and either GFP-*ΔR* or empty vector. After 42 h, the cells were treated with or without MG132 for 6 h. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody. The ubiquitination was detected using an antibody specific for ubiquitin, and TRAF6 and ΔR were detected using anti-HA and anti-GFP antibodies. (**d**) H1299 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3B were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding HA-*TRAF6* and either HA-*ΔR* or empty vector. After 42 h, the cells were treated with or without 20 μM chloroquine (CQ) for 6 h. The autophagy-related proteins were analyzed by western blot.\n\nWe next detected the inhibitory effect of ΔR on the TRAF6-induced autophagy. In cells co-transfected with plasmids encoding TRAF6 and ΔR, the expression of LC3-II was not changed when compared with the cells transfected with the TRAF6 plasmid alone. Also, the expression levels of SQSTM1 were similar between these 2 groups ([Figure 6(d](#F0006))). In the group co-transfected with plasmids for HA-TRAF6 and HA-ΔR, the percentage of the cells with GFP-LC3B puncta was not changed significantly compared with the group transfected with the HA-TRAF6 plasmid alone (Fig. S6A). These data demonstrated that overexpressing ΔR did not block the autophagy process induced by TRAF6. Then, we tested the ubiquitination function of this mutant on BECN1. Overexpressing ΔR did not change the ubiquitination of BECN1, and the inhibitory effect of TRIM59 on autophagy was not observed for this mutant (Fig. S6B, S6C). Taken together, the ring domain of TRIM59 is important for regulating the ubiquitination of TRAF6 and the TRAF6-induced autophagy.\n\nBoth the transcription and the ubiquitination of BECN1 are necessary for the autophagy induced by TRIM59 knockdown {#S0002-S2007}\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs TRIM59 affects both the expression and the K63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1, we next wanted to examine whether both effects were necessary for autophagy induced by TRIM59 knockdown. *RELA* siRNAs were co-transfected with *TRIM59* siRNA into H1299 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3B. [Figure 7a](#F0007) showed that the GFP-LC3B puncta were significantly increased when TRIM59 was knocked down. In addition, the percentage of the cells with GFP-LC3B puncta increased significantly; however, knocking down RELA decreased the total GFP-LC3B puncta and the cell numbers with GFP-LC3B puncta. The expression of LC3-Ⅱ was increased when knocking down TRIM59, whereas knocking down RELA reversed these effects. In [Figure 7b](#F0007), *TRAF6* siRNAs were transfected into H1299 cells with TRIM59 knockdown. We discovered increased GFP-LC3B puncta and enhanced expression of LC3-II when TRIM59 was knocked down, whereas TRAF6 knockdown remarkably reduced the LC3B puncta and LC3-II expression induced by TRIM59 knockdown.10.1080/15548627.2018.1491493-F0007Figure 7.Both the transcription of *BECN1* and the ubiquitination of BECN1 are necessary for the autophagy induced by TRIM59 knockdown. (**a**) *TRIM59* siRNA was co-transfected with or without *RELA* siRNAs into H1299 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3B. After 48 h, the cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus IX83).

The expression of related proteins was examined by western blot (bottom panel).\n\nNoting that the expression level of BECN1 remained unchanged between the cells transfected with *TRIM59* siRNA and the cells co-transfected with *TRIM59* and *TRAF6* siRNAs, we proposed that both the expression and the ubiquitination of BECN1 were important for autophagy induction. To further demonstrate this, we overexpressed BECN1 in H1299 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3B with or without TRAF6 knockdown. We found that BECN1 overexpression strongly induced autophagy as determined by increased cell numbers with GFP-LC3B puncta and enhanced expression of LC3-II, whereas TRAF6 knockdown decreased the effects ([Figure 7(c](#F0007))). A previous study demonstrated that the Lys117 of BECN1 was the major ubiquitination site for K63-linkage and the Glu299 of BECN1 was important for the recruitment of TRAF6 to BECN1 \\[[34](#CIT0034)\\]. We then mutated these 2 residues of BECN1 and assessed the autophagy induction effects. As shown in Figure S7A-S7C, the autophagy induction effects for BECN1^K117R^ and BECN1^E299A^ were significantly attenuated compared with BECN1 wild-type. These results demonstrated that both the transcription and the ubiquitination of BECN1 were important for autophagy induced by TRIM59 knockdown.\n\nDiscussion {#S0003}\n==========\n\nBECN1 plays a central role in autophagy that triggers a cascade of proteins involved in autophagosome formation \\[[1](#CIT0001)\\]. The regulation of BECN1 can occur at the level of transcription, translation and post-translational modifications \\[[8](#CIT0008)\\]. At the transcription level, the transcription factor E2F1 and NFKB can bind to the promoter region of the *BECN1* gene to enhance transcription \\[[32](#CIT0032),[42](#CIT0042)\\]. However, another transcription factor, SMAD2, negatively regulates the transcription of *BECN1* and thus represses autophagy in endothelial cells \\[[43](#CIT0043)\\]. These studies demonstrate that modulating the expression of BECN1 is an important event in autophagy induction. In the current study, we found that the expression of TRIM59 and BECN1 were inversely correlated in NSCLC. Further studies demonstrated that TRIM59 repressed the transcription of *BECN1*. Although TRIM59 is not a transcription factor, it acted as a negative regulator of the NFKB pathway, and thus affected BECN1 expression. This was one of the mechanisms for TRIM59 to regulate autophagy determined in our study. TRIM59 has now been accepted as an important oncoprotein, and the molecular mechanisms for its tumor-promoting functions are very preliminary. Previous studies proved that TRIM59 could also affect the TP53 pathway, SMAD2/3 pathway and AKT pathway \\[[11](#CIT0011),[44](#CIT0044)--[46](#CIT0046)\\]. These findings together with ours indicated that TRIM59 has many profound functions including the effect on autophagy, and these functions are important for cancer progression.\n\nPost-translational modifications (PTMs) of BECN1 including phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination are essential for autophagy induction \\[[47](#CIT0047)\\]. Ubiquitination of BECN1 affects either its protein stability or functions. NEDD4 was reported to ubiquitinate BECN1 with a K11-linkage for proteasomal degradation when *PIK3C3/VPS34* is depleted \\[[48](#CIT0048)\\]. In another study, USP19 was reported to rescue the proteasomal degradation of BECN1 through removing the K11-linked ubiquitination \\[[49](#CIT0049)\\]. K63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1 is critical for TLR4-induced autophagy, and TRAF6 functions as an E3 ligase in this process \\[[34](#CIT0034)\\]. In our study, we found that except for the effect on the transcription of *BECN1*, TRIM59 knockdown induced autophagy accompanied by the upregulation of BECN1 ubiquitination. As TRIM59 functions as an E3 ligase, this result was in contrast with our initial idea that TRIM59 inhibited autophagy by ubiquitination and degradation of BECN1. What interesting results we found were that TRIM59 regulated K63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1 through direct ubiquitination and degradation of TRAF6, and the ring domain of TRIM59 was essential in this process. We finally demonstrated that both the transcriptional effects on *BECN1* by RELA and the binding of TRAF6 to BECN1 were essential for autophagy induced by TRIM59 knockdown. In conclusion, we discovered the dual roles of TRIM59 in autophagy regulation by regulating both the transcription and K63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1.\n\nUntil now, many studies have proved that TRIM proteins are associated with autophagy. The expression of TRIM55 parallels that of autophagy proteins NBR1, SQSTM1 and LC3 during cardiac myofibril assembly and turnover \\[[15](#CIT0015)\\]. TRIM30 localizes in cytoplasmic bodies with ubiquitin chains and the autophagy marker LC3, and is degraded through both proteasome and autophagy pathways \\[[16](#CIT0016)\\]. TRIM11 can act as a receptor to recruit AIM2 to SQSTM1 for selective autophagy degradation upon DNA virus infection \\[[17](#CIT0017)\\]. Another study demonstrated that TRIM23 is essential for autophagy in response to viral infection and a TRIM23-TBK1-SQSTM1 axis is a key component in selective autophagy \\[[18](#CIT0018)\\]. TRIM13 regulates the initiation of autophagy during ER stress and TRIM13-induced autophagy is essential for ER stress-induced caspase activation and cell death \\[[19](#CIT0019),[20](#CIT0020)\\]. The interaction between TRIM16 and LGALS3 orchestrates the recruitment of core autophagic factors and activates selective autophagy in response to damaged endomembranes \\[[21](#CIT0021)\\]. Besides, TRIM16 can also act as a receptor for IL1B and interact with SEC22B to recruit cargo to LC3-II-positive sequestration membrane in response to lysosomal damage, a process termed secretory autophagy \\[[22](#CIT0022)\\]. In ATG5- or ATG7-deficient cells, TRIM31 directly interacts with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in a palmitoylation-dependent manner, leading to the induction of autophagy. In this process, the B-box domain of TRIM31 is required for the formation of TRIM31-positive puncta and colocalization with PE \\[[23](#CIT0023)\\]. The E3 ubiquitin ligase complex of TRIM28 with its regulators MAGEA3 or MAGEA6 (MAGEA3/6-TRIM28) can target AMPK for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation, resulting in significantly reduced autophagy. However, in cells not expressing MAGEA3 or MAGEA6, TRIM28 functions as a pro-autophagy factor through sumoylating PIK3C3/VPS34 and promoting the formation of the PIK3C3-BECN1 complex \\[[24](#CIT0024)\\]. In another study, TRIM17 can inhibit certain types of selective autophagy by stabilizing the MCL1-BECN1 complex. However, TRIM17 can also promote the removal of midbodies through autophagy because of the absence of MCL1 from TRIM17-BECN1 complexes at midbodies \\[[25](#CIT0025)\\]. These 2 TRIM proteins (TRIM17 and TRIM28) further expand the roles of TRIM proteins in regulating autophagy by showing that a single TRIM can either positively or negatively regulate autophagy depending upon different conditions.\n\nA recent comprehensive analysis demonstrated that some TRIM proteins act as platforms assembling activated ULK1 and BECN1 to induce autophagy. Besides, TRIM5/TRIM5α can also act as an autophagy receptor by directly recognizing its cognate target without a need for ubiquitin tagging \\[[26](#CIT0026)\\]. Another comprehensive study demonstrated that a subset of TRIM proteins (such as MEFV/TRIM20 and TRIM21) function as regulators and receptors for autophagy-targeting components of the inflammasome and type Ⅰ IFN response systems \\[[27](#CIT0027)\\]. These studies demonstrate that the functions of TRIM proteins in autophagy induction are diverse and each TRIM protein may have a specific function in autophagosome formation, suggesting that a particular TRIM protein does not compensate for the function of other TRIM proteins in autophagy induction. Although the function of TRIM59 in cancer progression has been intensively studied, the role of TRIM59 in autophagy induction has not been clarified yet. Thus, our studies point out another new way for the TRIM proteins to regulate autophagy though regulating the transcription and modulating the post-translational modifications of autophagy-related proteins.\n\nMaterials and methods {#S0004}\n=====================\n\nCell culture and NSCLC patient samples {#S0004-S2001}\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines H1299, A549, H292, H358, H1975, H23, HCC827 from ATCC were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, C11875500BT), containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Excel, FCS100).

If philosophy is, as\nis commonly assumed, appropriate to a phase in the development of every\nindividual, it should _grow out_ of interests to which he is already\nalive. And if the great philosophers are indeed never dead, this fact\nshould manifest itself in their classic or historical representation of\na perennial outlook upon the world. I am not seeking to attach to\nphilosophy a fictitious liveliness, wherewith to insinuate it into the\ngood graces of the student. I hope rather to be true to the meaning of\nphilosophy. For there is that in its stand-point and its problem which\nmakes it universally significant entirely apart from dialectic and\nerudition. These are derived interests, indispensable to the scholar,\nbut quite separable from that modicum of philosophy which helps to make\nthe man. The present book is written for the sake of elucidating the\ninevitable philosophy. It seeks to make the reader more solicitously\naware of the philosophy that is in him, or to provoke him to philosophy\nin his own interests. To this end I have sacrificed all else to the task\nof mediating between the tradition and technicalities of the academic\ndiscipline and the more common terms of life.\n\nThe purpose of the book will in part account for those shortcomings that\nimmediately reveal themselves to the eye of the scholar. In Part I\nvarious great human interests have been selected as points of departure.\nI have sought to introduce the general stand-point and problem of\nphilosophy through its implication in practical life, poetry, religion,\nand science. But in so doing it has been necessary for me to deal\nshortly with topics of great independent importance, and so risk the\ndisfavor of those better skilled in these several matters. This is\nevidently true of the chapter which deals with natural science. But the\nproblem which I there faced differed radically from those of the\nforegoing chapters, and the method of treatment is correspondingly\ndifferent. In the case of natural science one has to deal with a body of\nknowledge which is frequently regarded as the only knowledge. To write a\nchapter about science from a philosophical stand-point is, in the\npresent state of opinion, to undertake a polemic against exclusive\nnaturalism, an attitude which is itself philosophical, and as such is\nwell known in the history of philosophy as _positivism_ or\n_agnosticism_. I have avoided the polemical spirit and method so far as\npossible, but have, nevertheless, here taken sides against a definite\nphilosophical position. This chapter, together with the Conclusion, is\ntherefore an exception to the purely introductory and expository\nrepresentation which I have, on the whole, sought to give. The\nrelatively great space accorded to the discussion of religion is, in my\nown belief, fair to the general interest in this topic, and to the\nintrinsic significance of its relation to philosophy.\n\nI have in Part II undertaken to furnish the reader with a map of the\ncountry to which he has been led. To this end I have attempted a brief\nsurvey of the entire programme of philosophy. An accurate and full\naccount of philosophical terms can be found in such books as Kuelpe's\n\"Introduction to Philosophy\" and Baldwin's \"Dictionary of Philosophy,\"\nand an attempt to emulate their thoroughness would be superfluous, even\nif it were conformable to the general spirit of this book. The scope of\nPart II is due in part to a desire for brevity, but chiefly to the hope\nof furnishing an epitome that shall follow the course of the _natural\nand historical differentiation_ of the general philosophical problem.\n\nFinally, I have in Part III sought to present the tradition of\nphilosophy in the form of general types. My purpose in undertaking so\ndifficult a task is to acquaint the reader with philosophy in the\nconcrete; to show how certain underlying principles may determine the\nwhole circle of philosophical ideas, and give them unity and distinctive\nflavor. Part II offers a general classification of philosophical\nproblems and conceptions independently of any special point of view. But\nI have in Part III sought to emphasize the point of view, or the\ninternal consistency that makes a _system of philosophy_ out of certain\nanswers to the special problems of philosophy. In such a division into\ntypes, lines are of necessity drawn too sharply. There will be many\nhistorical philosophies that refuse to fit, and many possibilities\nunprovided for. I must leave it to the individual reader to overcome\nthis abstractness through his own reflection upon the intermediate and\nvariant stand-points.\n\nAlthough the order is on the whole that of progressive complexity, I\nhave sought to treat each chapter with independence enough to make it\npossible for it to be read separately; and I have provided a carefully\nselected bibliography in the hope that this book may serve as a stimulus\nand guide to the reading of other books.\n\nThe earlier chapters have already appeared as articles: Chapter I in the\n_International Journal of Ethics_, Vol. XIII, No. 4; Chapter II in the\n_Philosophical Review_, Vol. XI, No. 6; Chapter III in the _Monist_,\nVol. XIV, No. 5; Chapter IV in the _International Journal of Ethics_,\nVol. XV, No. 1; and some paragraphs of Chapter V in the _Journal of\nPhilosophy, Psychology, and Scientific Methods_, Vol. I, No. 7. I am\nindebted to the editors of these periodicals for permission to reprint\nwith minor changes.\n\nIn the writing of this, my first book, I have been often reminded that\na higher critic, skilled in the study of internal evidence, could\nprobably trace all of its ideas to suggestions that have come to me from\nmy teachers and colleagues of the Department of Philosophy in Harvard\nUniversity. I have unscrupulously forgotten what of their definite ideas\nI have adapted to my own use, but not that I received from them the\nmajor portion of my original philosophical capital. I am especially\nindebted to Professor William James for the inspiration and resources\nwhich I have received from his instruction and personal friendship.\n\n                                              RALPH BARTON PERRY.\n\nCAMBRIDGE, March, 1905.\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[vii:A] Edw.

Philosophy suffers the distinction of being regarded as\nessentially an academic pursuit. The term _philosophy_, to be sure, is\nused in common speech to denote a stoical manner of accepting the\nvicissitudes of life; but this conception sheds little or no light upon\nthe meaning of philosophy as a branch of scholarship. The men who write\nthe books on \"Epistemology\" or \"Ontology,\" are regarded by the average\nman of affairs, even though he may have enjoyed a \"higher education,\"\nwith little sympathy and less intelligence. Not even philology seems\nless concerned with the real business of life. The pursuit of philosophy\nappears to be a phenomenon of extreme and somewhat effete culture, with\nits own peculiar traditions, problems, and aims, and with little or\nnothing to contribute to the real enterprises of society. It is easy to\nprove to the satisfaction of the philosopher that such a view is\nradically mistaken. But it is another and more serious matter to bridge\nover the very real gap that separates philosophy and common-sense. Such\nan aim is realized only when philosophy is seen to issue from some\nspecial interest that is humanly important; or when, after starting in\nthought at a point where one deals with ideas and interests common to\nall, one is led by the inevitableness of consistent thinking into the\nsphere of philosophy.\n\n[Sidenote: Life as a Starting-point for Thought.]\n\nSect. 2. There is but one starting-point for reflection when all men are\ninvited to share in it. Though there be a great many special platforms\nwhere special groups of men may take their stand together, there is only\none platform broad enough for all. This universal stand-point, or common\nplatform, is _life_. It is our more definite thesis, then, that\nphilosophy, even to its most abstruse technicality, is rooted in life;\nand that it is inseparably bound up with the satisfaction of practical\nneeds, and the solution of practical problems.\n\nEvery man knows what it is to live, and his immediate experience will\nverify those features of the adventure that stand out conspicuously. To\nbegin with, life is our birthright. We did not ask for it, but when we\ngrew old enough to be self-conscious we found ourselves in possession\nof it. Nor is it a gift to be neglected, even if we had the will. As is\ntrue of no other gift of nature, we must use it, or cease to be. There\nis a unique urgency about life. But we have already implied more, in so\nfar as we have said that it must be _used_, and have thereby referred to\nsome form of movement or activity as its inseparable attribute. To\nlive is to find one's self compelled to do something. To do\n_something_--there is another implication of life: some outer\nexpression, some medium in which to register the degree and form of its\nactivity. Such we recognize as the environment of life, the real objects\namong which it is placed; which it may change, or from which it may\nsuffer change. Not only do we find our lives as unsolicited active\npowers, but find, as well, an arena prescribed for their exercise. That\nwe shall act, and in a certain time and place, and with reference to\ncertain other realities, this is the general condition of things that is\nencountered when each one of us discovers life. In short, to live means\nto be compelled to do something under certain circumstances.\n\nThere is another very common aspect of life that would not at first\nglance seem worthy of mention. Not only does life, as we have just\ndescribed it, mean opportunity, but it means self-conscious opportunity.\nThe facts are such as we have found them to be, and as each one of us\nhas previously found them for himself. But when we discover life for\nourselves, we who make the discovery, and we who live, are identical.\nFrom that moment we both live, and know that we live. Moreover, such is\nthe essential unity of our natures that our living must now express our\nknowing, and our knowing guide and illuminate our living. Consider the\nallegory of the centipede. From the beginning of time he had manipulated\nhis countless legs with exquisite precision. Men had regarded him with\nwonder and amazement. But he was innocent of his own art, being a\ncontrivance of nature, perfectly constructed to do her bidding. One day\nthe centipede discovered life. He discovered himself as one who walks,\nand the newly awakened intelligence, first observing, then foreseeing,\nat length began to direct the process. And from that moment the\ncentipede, because he could not remember the proper order of his going,\nlost all his former skill, and became the poor clumsy victim of his own\nself-consciousness. This same self-consciousness is the inconvenience\nand the great glory of human life. We must stumble along as best we\ncan, guided by the feeble light of our own little intelligence. If\nnature starts us on our way, she soon hands over the torch, and bids us\nfind the trail for ourselves. Most men are brave enough to regard this\nas the best thing of all; some despair on account of it. In either case\nit is admittedly the true story of human life. We must live as separate\nselves, observing, foreseeing, and planning. There are two things that\nwe can do about it. We can repudiate our natures, decline the\nresponsibility, and degenerate to the level of those animals that never\nhad our chance; or we can leap joyously to the helm, and with all the\nstrength and wisdom in us guide our lives to their destination. But if\nwe do the former, we shall be unable to forget what might have been, and\nshall be haunted by a sense of ignominy; and if we do the second, we\nshall experience the unique happiness of fulfilment and\nself-realization.\n\nLife, then, is a situation that appeals to intelligent activity. Humanly\nspeaking, there is no such thing as a situation that is not at the same\ntime a theory. As we live we are all theorists. Whoever has any\nmisgivings as to the practical value of theory, let him remember that,\nspeaking generally of human life, it is true to say that there is no\npractice that does not issue at length from reflection. That which is\nthe commonest experience of mankind is the conjunction of these two, the\nthought and the deed. And as surely as we are all practical theorists,\nso surely is philosophy the outcome of the broadening and deepening of\npractical theory. But to understand how the practical man becomes the\nphilosopher, we must inquire somewhat more carefully into the manner of\nhis thought about life.\n\n[Sidenote: The Practical Knowledge of Means.]\n\nSect. 3. Let anyone inspect the last moment in his life, and in all\nprobability he will find that his mind was employed to discover the\nmeans to some end. He was already bent upon some definite achievement,\nand was thoughtful for the sake of selecting the economical and\neffectual way. His theory made his practice skilful. So through life his\nknowledge shows him how to work his will. Example, experience, and books\nhave taught him the uses of nature and society, and in his thoughtful\nliving he is enabled to reach the goal he has set for the next hour,\nday, or year of his activity. The long periods of human life are spent\nin elaborating the means to some unquestioned end. Here one meets the\ncurious truth that we wake up in the middle of life, already making\nheadway, and under the guidance of some invisible steersman. When first\nwe take the business of life seriously, there is a considerable stock in\ntrade in the shape of habits, and inclinations to all sorts of things\nthat we never consciously elected to pursue. Since we do not begin at\nthe beginning, our first problem is to accommodate ourselves to\nourselves, and our first deliberate acts are in fulfilment of plans\noutlined by some predecessor that has already spoken for us. The same\nthing is true of the race of men. At a certain stage in their\ndevelopment men found themselves engaged in all manner of ritual and\ncustom, and burdened with concerns that were not of their own choosing.\nThey were burning incense, keeping festivals, and naming names, all of\nwhich they must now proceed to justify with myth and legend, in order to\nrender intelligible to themselves the deliberate and self-conscious\nrepetition of them. Even so much justification was left to the few, and\nthe great majority continued to seek that good which social usage\ncountenanced and individual predisposition confirmed. So every man of us\nacts from day to day for love's sake, or wealth's sake, or power's\nsake, or for the sake of some near and tangible object; reflecting only\nfor the greater efficiency of his endeavor.\n\n[Sidenote: The Practical Knowledge of the End or Purpose.]\n\nSect. 4. But if this be the common manner of thinking about life, it\ndoes not represent the whole of such thought. Nor does it follow that\nbecause it occupies us so much, it is therefore correspondingly\nfundamental. Like the myth makers of old, we all want more or less to\nknow the _reason of our ends_. Here, then, we meet with a somewhat\ndifferent type of reflection upon life, the reflection that underlies\nthe adoption of a life purpose. It is obvious that most ends are\nselected for the sake of other ends, and so are virtually means. Thus\none may struggle for years to secure a college education. This definite\nend has been adopted for the sake of a somewhat more indefinite end of\nself-advancement, and from it there issues a whole series of minor ends,\nwhich form a hierarchy of steps ascending to the highest goal of\naspiration. Now upon the face of things we live very unsystematic lives,\nand yet were we to examine ourselves in this fashion, we should all find\nour lives to be marvels of organization. Their growth, as we have seen,\nbegan before we were conscious of it; and we are commonly so absorbed\nin some particular flower or fruit that we forget the roots, and the\ndesign of the whole. But a little reflection reveals a remarkable\nunitary adjustment of parts. The unity is due to the dominance of a\ngroup of central purposes. Judged from the stand-point of experience, it\nseems bitter irony to say that everyone gets from life just what he\nwishes. But a candid searching of our own hearts will incline us to\nadmit that, after all, the way we go and the length we go is determined\npretty much by the kind and the intensity of our secret longing. That\nfor which in the time of choice we are willing to sacrifice all else, is\nthe formula that defines the law of each individual life. All this is\nnot intended to mean that we have each named a clear and definite ideal\nwhich is our chosen goal. On the contrary, such a conception may be\nalmost meaningless to some of us. In general the higher the ideal the\nvaguer and less vivid is its presentation to our consciousness. But,\nnamed or unnamed, sharp or blurred, vivid or half-forgotten, there may\nbe found in the heart of every man that which of all things he wants to\nbe, that which of all deeds he wants to do. If he has had the normal\nyouth of dreaming, he has seen it, and warmed to the picture of his\nimagination; if he has been somewhat more thoughtful than the ordinary,\nhis reason has defined it, and adopted it for his vocation; if neither,\nit has been present as an undertone throughout the rendering of his more\ninevitable life. He will recognize it when it is named as the desire to\ndo the will of God, or to have as good a time as possible, or to make\nother people as happy as possible, or to be equal to his\nresponsibilities, or to fulfil the expectation of his mother, or to be\ndistinguished, wealthy, or influential. This list of ideals is\nmiscellaneous, and ethically reducible to more fundamental concepts, but\nthese are the terms in which men are ordinarily conscious of their most\nintimate purposes. We must now inquire respecting the nature of the\nthought that determines the selection of such a purpose, or justifies it\nwhen it has been unconsciously accepted.\n\n[Sidenote: The Philosophy of the Devotee, the Man of Affairs, and the\nVoluptuary.]\n\nSect. 5. What is most worth while? So far as human action is concerned\nthis obviously depends upon what is possible, upon what is expected of\nus by our own natures, and upon what interests and concerns are\nconserved by the trend of events in our environment. What I had best\ndo, presupposes what I have the strength and the skill to do, what I\nfeel called upon to do, and what are the great causes that are entitled\nto promotion at my hands. It seems that practically we cannot separate\nthe ideal from the real. We may feel that the highest ideal is an\nimmediate utterance of conscience, as mysterious in origin as it is\nauthoritative in expression. We may be willing to defy the universe, and\nexpatriate ourselves from our natural and social environment, for the\nsake of the holy law of duty. Such men as Count Tolstoi have little to\nsay of the possible, or the expedient, or the actual, and are satisfied\nto stand almost alone against the brutal facts of usage and economy. We\nall have a secret sense of chivalry, that prompts, however\nineffectually, to a like devotion. But that which in such moral purposes\nappears to indicate a severance of the ideal and the real, is, if we\nwill but stop to consider, only a severance of the ideal and the\napparent. The martyr is more sure of reality than the adventurer. He is\nconvinced that though his contemporaries and his environment be against\nhim; the fundamental or eventual order of things is for him. He believes\nin a spiritual world more abiding, albeit less obvious, than the\nmaterial world. Though every temporal event contradict him, he lives in\nthe certainty that eternity is his. Such an one may have found his ideal\nin the voice of God and His prophets, or he may have been led to God as\nthe justification of his irresistible ideal; but in either case the\nselection of his ideal is reasonable to him in so far as it is\nharmonious with the ultimate nature of things, or stands for the promise\nof reality. In this wise, thought about life expands into some\nconception of the deeper forces of the world, and life itself, in\nrespect of its fundamental attachment to an ideal, implies some belief\nconcerning the fundamental nature of its environment.\n\nBut lest in this account life be credited with too much gravity and\nimport, or it seem to be assumed that life is all knight-errantry, let\nus turn to our less quixotic, and perhaps more effectual, man of\naffairs. He works for his daily bread, and for success in his vocation.\nHe has selected his vocation for its promise of return in the form of\nwealth, comfort, fame, or influence. He likewise performs such\nadditional service to his family and his community as is demanded of him\nby public opinion and his own sense of responsibility. He may have a\ncertain contempt for the man who sees visions. This may be his manner of\ntestifying to his own preference for the ideal of usefulness and\nimmediate efficiency. But even so he would never for an instant admit\nthat he was pursuing a merely conventional good. He may be largely\nimitative in his standards of value, recognizing such aims as are common\nto some time or race; nevertheless none would be more sure than he of\nthe truth of his ideal. Question him, and he will maintain that his is\nthe reasonable life under the conditions of human existence. He may\nmaintain that if there be a God, he can best serve Him by promoting the\ntangible welfare of himself and those dependent upon him. He may\nmaintain that, since there is no God, he must win such rewards as the\nworld can give. If he have something of the heroic in him, he may tell\nyou that, since there is no God, he will labor to the uttermost for his\nfellow-men. Where he has not solved the problem of life for himself, he\nmay believe himself to be obeying the insight of some one wiser than\nhimself, or of society as expressed in its customs and institutions. But\nno man ever admitted that his life was purely a matter of expediency, or\nthat in his dominant ideal he was the victim of chance. In the\nbackground of the busiest and most preoccupied life of affairs, there\ndwells the conviction that such living is appropriate to the universe;\nthat it is called for by the circumstances of its origin, opportunities,\nand destiny.\n\nFinally, the man who makes light of life has of all men the most\ntransparent inner consciousness. In him may be clearly observed the\nrelation between the ideal and the reflection that is assumed to justify\nit.\n\n     \"A Moment's Halt--a momentary taste\n      Of Being from the Well amid the Waste--\n      And Lo!--the phantom Caravan has reach'd\n      The Nothing it set out from-- . . .\"\n\n     \"We are no other than a moving row\n      Of Magic Shadow-shapes that come and go\n      Round with the Sun-illumin'd Lantern held\n      In Midnight by the Master of the Show.\"\n\nWhere the setting of life is construed in these terms, there is but one\nnatural and appropriate manner of life. Once believing in the isolation\nand insignificance of life, one is sceptical of all worth save such as\nmay be tasted in the moment of its purchase. If one's ideas and\nexperiences are no concern of the world's, but incidents of a purely\nlocal and transient interest, they will realize most when they realize\nan immediate gratification. Where one does not believe that he is a\nmember of the universe, and a contributor to its ends, he does well to\nminimize the friction that arises from its accidental propinquity, and\nto kindle some little fire of enjoyment in his own lonely heart. This is\nthe life of abandonment to pleasure, accompanied by the conviction that\nthe conditions of life warrant no more strenuous or heroic plan.\n\n[Sidenote: The Adoption of Purposes and the Philosophy of Life.]\n\nSect. 6. In such wise do we adopt the life purpose, or justify it when\nunconsciously adopted. The pursuit of an ideal implies a belief in its\neffectuality. Such a belief will invariably appear when the groundwork\nof the daily living is laid bare by a little reflection. And if our\nanalysis has not been in error, there is something more definite to be\nobtained from it. We all believe in the practical wisdom of our\nfundamental ideals; but we believe, besides, that such wisdom involves\nthe sanction of the universe as a whole. The momentousness of an\nindividual's life will be satisfied with nothing less final than an\nabsolutely wise disposition of it. For every individual, his life is all\nhis power and riches, and is not to be spent save for the _greatest good\nthat he can reasonably pursue_. But the solution of such a problem is\nnot to be obtained short of a searching of entire reality. Every life\nwill represent more or less of such wisdom and enlightenment; and in the\nend the best selection of ideal will denote the greatest wealth of\nexperience. It is not always true that he who has seen more will live\nmore wisely, for in an individual case instinct or authority may be\nbetter sources of aspiration than experience. But we trust instinct and\nauthority because we believe them to represent a comprehensive\nexperience on the part of the race as a whole, or on the part of God. He\nwhose knowledge is broadest and truest would know best what is finally\nworth living for. On this account, most men can see no more reasonable\nplan of life than obedience to God's will, for God in the abundance of\nhis wisdom, and since all eternity is plain before him, must see with\ncertainty that which is supremely worthy.\n\nWe mean, then, that the selection of our ideals shall be determined by\nthe largest possible knowledge of the facts pertaining to life. We mean\nto select as one would select who knew all about the antecedents and\nsurroundings and remote consequences of life. In our own weakness and\nfinitude we may go but a little way in the direction of such an\ninsight, and may prefer to accept the judgment of tradition or\nauthority, but we recognize a distinct type of knowledge as alone worthy\nto justify an individual's adoption of an ideal. That type of knowledge\nis the knowledge that comprehends the universe in its totality. Such\nknowledge does not involve completeness of information respecting all\nparts of reality. This, humanly speaking, is both unattainable and\ninconceivable.

And, the superhero to head up that new profit center should be Brandon Foster.\nYesterday, when I started on the purchasing journey to get into a SMART car, I was the typical angst-ridden older shopper. You bet, I had had my share of lousy experiences with car dealers.\nBut I needed a car. For 26 months I had been conducting an interesting experiment: Could I really go carless? In my career coaching, I encourage financially strapped clients to ditch the car and do public transportation. Yet, despite my noble intentions, the combination of public transportation, Uber and bicycling just wasn't cutting it.\nOn the internet, I had spotted the perfect fit of SMART car. It was at a price I could do w/o a car note. Here is my story about 6-figure debt back in 2003. No longer do I buy anything on credit.\nThe problem was this: The SMART car was in MI. I am in Ohio, 44 miles away. No public transportation links. My social network is too stressed out to put the muscle on for a ride.\nNo problem for Foster.\nHe picked me up at my door in Toledo.\nThen, he was emotionally there in the passenger seat. I struggled to regain confidence in my driving skills, after not being on 4-wheels for more than 2 years.\nHe answered my sustained barrage of questions. In detail.\nHe even helped with the insurance company. He explained that I could search for perhaps a better fit of provider, once I had time to absorb being back in the driver's seat - pun intended.\nAt a bit before 3 P.M. I confidently pulled out the Fischer Honda parking lot in my powder-blue SMART car. Busy I-94? Got right on it. And, since I now had a car I was able to swing by a pet store far from my house and pick up treats for my four-legged son LOV. This Saturday, LOV and I will make the trip to Geneva on the Lake to watch the waves rolling on Lake Erie. Soon enough the water will be frozen.\nThank you, Brandon Foster.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "c9fa966b-b8f8-4910-8cfe-c15d8c7058b7", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "1. 8个语法错误\n2. 为什么买车的选择经历"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "a3f044c4-35cf-42eb-8c70-fbe9442544eb", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 网站需要登录才能打开"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "9640a262-994b-4d0a-be27-e0b9f27d8bd9", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "营销内容：车辆\n思路：从一个用户角度叙述了买车后的生活"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "c037dab0-9f62-41a8-8b9e-2340e00d1289", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "上下文联系不紧密"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Is it necessary for the two commissioners to travel for the purpose of travelling to check the tailoring of the uniform? Or is it better for one to remain and be useful at home.\nCommissioner you have appointed a uniform committee as such why not pick one of the committee member and logistic and store staff instead of two most senior officers.\nWe question which fund have you allocated for the trip. To our understanding, in budget workshop last year there was no fund allocated for such trip.\nWe are reminding you commissioner to work your talk; you also talk about spending tax payers’ money wisely and in this case you are acting differently.\nOn the other hand should the trip be funded by Lotus Fiji, then we will be more suspicious.\nWe remember two years back Lotus funded a trip to Australia for Patrick Sale, Deputy Commissioner Operation, to travel under their expense.\nBooked in five star hotel, high allowance paid, comes home very satisfied but the uniform was not value for money. You ask every correctional officer and they will tell a story about the uniforms. Isn’t this a corruption that needs to be investigated?\nThere are very minor cases such as late for duty, absent for duties that are investigated and officers disciplined, why this matter can’t be investigated, there may be some secret behind such deal which commissioner is hiding.\nWhere is the adoption of best practices that commissioner Haisoma makes mentioned of every now and then?\nInstead, he is entertaining and facilitating bad practices or worse practices.\nIn the past when CSSI dealt with uniform, the dealers from grown agency (London) Collin Carr (New Zealand) normally come over to the country with samples, when the management agrees with the particular material, pattern, colour and it’s over.\nWhen tailoring is done consignment sent with no additional cost. Isn’t that a good practice that we should maintain?\nMr Commissioner your deputies are enjoying all the privileges that you have given them but we are questioning their capabilities.\nReporting very late to work, missing part of the day, gone in the afternoon never return.

How much does it cost to hire a car in Morocco? What airlinecodataurnultimatebrauhausiolook?”\nMeanwhile, little wisps of white hair floating among the clouds released by passing planes, creating the only kind of visual commonly encountered by homos.\nMeanwhile, little Italy got away with not answering any of our pressing questions, because she didn’t have to. Life was beautiful. 1936 came and went with only a few scattered memories in a brown photographic memory. We were left with a few photographs, a few words ofepad, and a yearning to return.\nThe next year our trip back home to the states, still without a clue when we’d return, was marked by a strong jet-lag; the years rolled by insidetheir passage.\nEventually, aspirin and anti-diarrsovulant drugs were added to the cocktail ofacks and I asked the doctor to reduce it to only take one.

If you don’t succeed in finding him/her, at least you will have sweated well and truly you lost that long ago.\nNow, of course, with the advent of the Internet, not only are you able to find your friend, you are able to talk to him/her about what you are doing or about life in general with the security of being able to grill him/her about it at length. It may take you some time to really get to know this new person, but you will get to know this person’s personality better than you ever would have on a journey filled with doubt and suspicion.\nAt the end of the day, this person will become more attractive to others, much more so than if he/she were an alien, as some friends seem to feel.

These illnesses can be reduced by implementing the HACCP concept (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point). However, the FSIS has the overall oversight and authority for quality control checks in meat and poultry products that are intended for commercial distribution. Its main responsibility is to ensure that there is a wholesome production of meat and poultry products.\nTherefore, all businesses that produce meat and poultry that is federally inspected should design and operate HACCP guidelines. The systems arising from these guidelines should be able to conduct scientific process controls that can be approved to effectively eliminate, reduce, or prevent food safety hazards.\nThe Seven HACCP Quality Control Checks for Meat and Poultry\n1. Conducting a Hazard Analysis\nA hazard is any chemical, biological, or physical cause that is likely to cause injuries or illness when not well controlled. This quality control check is important because it helps in developing hazards that may cause illness or harm when not controlled effectively. In the HACCP plan, it is important to consider the raw materials and other ingredients, storage and distribution, and use by a consumer.\nThe potential hazards are evaluated depending on their severity and their likely outcome. Severity considerations including impact, magnitude, and duration of injury or illness can help in understanding the health hazards to the public.\n2. Pinpoint Critical Control Meat packing quality control for export points\nA CCP is important in eliminating or preventing food safety hazards. Potential hazards that can cause injury or illnesses if control is absent should be addressed by determining the CCPs. The information that is developed in the hazard analysis will be used by the HACCP team to identify CCPs in the process.\nSome examples of CCPs include chilling, thermal processing, testing for chemical residues, testing products for contaminants, and product formulation. CCPs should be developed and also documented carefully. Additionally, they should be used for product safety purposes.\n3.Establishing Critical Meat packing quality control for export limits\nMeat packing quality control for export\nMeat packing quality control for export\nWhen developing HACCP quality control checks, the next step involves establishing critical limits for all control points. The critical limits are arguments that help determine whether a control measure of the CCP is out of control.\nThe NACMCF (National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods) defines a critical limit as a maximum or minimum value where chemical, biological, or physical parameters can be controlled to reduce, prevent, or eliminate the occurrence of food safety hazards.\n4.Establish Critical Control Point Monitoring Procedures\nAfter CL is set for each and every CCP in the HACCP development plan, there are certain procedures that should be established to monitor CCPs and to help in determining whether critical limits are being met. Monitoring should assess whether the CCP is still under control and to provide a record that can be used in future.\nPurpose of monitoring\nTrack control of the entire process\nTo identify when deviation occurs, and when there is loss of control\nTo provide a document for verification purposes\n5.Establishing Meat packing quality control for export Corrective Actions\nCorrective action should be determined for each CCP in cases where the CL hasn’t been met. Corrective actions used often depend on the type of process and type of food produced. In case there is any deviation from the CL, corrective action is required to prevent any hazardous food materials from being distributed to consumers.\nExamples of Corrective Actions\nDetecting and removing the cause of deviation\nKeeping the CCP under control after taking the corrective action\nInstituting measures that prevent recurrence\nMaking sure the affected produce isn’t shipped to consumers\n6.Establishing Recordkeeping Procedures\nWhen coming up with an HACCP plan, a firm should ensure that its system is effective in recordkeeping. This is because records are written evidence of the HACCP system. All the measurements and corrective actions that are taken should also be documented and filed.\nThese records can help to trace the history of the production of the finished product. In case there are any questions, the records can be used to determine whether the end product was safe for consumption.\n7.Verification Procedures\nHACCP systems of meat and poultry businesses should be systematically verified. There are four main verification principles used to verify HACCP systems as stated by the NACMCF. The verification process ensures that HACCP plans are implemented as planned. This process also confirms that the critical control points are accurate.\nTOP FOOD SAFETY CHALLENGES IN THE MEAT INDUSTRY\nEnsuring Food Safety in today’s day and age, is the most important and critical requirement of the Food industry, considering the increasing food-borne illness globally, with each passing year. With changing times, food safety is directly linked to promoting good health, nutrition, which would in turn ensure a healthy workforce along with a stable economic growth for manufacturers, suppliers, consumers, industry and ultimately the nation. Food Safety is a growing challenge for countries all over the world, and the pandemic that the world is facing today, throws light on how crucial it is, for the very existence of a healthy life and environment.\nFOOD SAFETY IN INDIA\nThe Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) releases a Food Safety index of States to measure the food safety on the basis of five parameters namely human resources and institutional data, compliance, food testing facility, training and capacity building besides consumer empowerment. This is to ensure states follow safe food practices and pay attention to nutrition and health.\nAmidst its numerous challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic offers a serendipitous opportunity to strengthen India's food safety system. Food safety highlights the hygiene and sanitary requirements, management responsibilities and sector specific requirements to prevent the spread of COVID-19 across the food supply chain. Safe food and hygienic practices are the pillars for ensuring food safety, and also form a strong basis for minimizing people-to-people spread and cross-contamination of COVID-19 in food operations. Keeping this in mind, existing personal and food hygiene measures in India need to be audited and possibly strengthened if need be.\nFOOD SAFETY AS A CHALLENGE IN MEAT INDUSTRY\nIndustries processing grains, sugar, edible oils, beverages and dairy products are the major industries constituting the Food processing industry. The key sub-segments of the Food Processing industry include the Dairy, Fruits & Vegetables, Poultry & Meat processing, Fisheries, Food retail etc. Here, we talk about the meat industry specifically.\nTop food safety challenges in Meat industry include -\nCoping up with the constantly evolving food regulations.\nComplying with the Food Industry safety standards.\nMaintaining meat quality standards in the overall processes.\nMaintaining meat quality assurance in the entire supply chain from breeding, processing, packaging to distribution.\nMeeting consumer expectations equally every time.\nEnsuring all the above mentioned requisites simultaneously, along with maintaining a balance between the supply and demand, is the biggest challenge for any meat industry to uphold its position in the market. Industries, who are able to adapt and improvise their food safety standards through implementation of modern, scientific methods can only sustain and triumph in the present industry\nIMPORTANCE OF QUALITY ASSURANCE WITHIN THE MEAT INDUSTRY\nMeat and meat products are the major contributor for protein rich foods in the food industry. Along with this it is also understood that they are also the highest-risk category in the food industry. With consumers today, being more and more informed and concerned about the quality of food they purchase, meeting the ever-evolving meat quality standards has become implicit, throughout all other processes, in the entire supply chain. Meat manufacturers need to adopt new approaches, strategies and services to meet current compliance standards, and expedite their access to the meat market. A predominant approach to this involves meat quality assurance through effective meat quality testing and getting a meat safety certificate through the expertise provided by an internationally recognised meat quality testing service provider. We are a globally accredited meat quality testing and certification provider offering a wide array of analytical services for the testing of raw materials and semi-manufactured or finished meat products.\nMEAT QUALITY ASSURANCE, MEAT QUALITY TESTING AND SAFETY CERTIFICATION\nMeat quality assurance is a proactive and preventive approach to have quality control of meat and meat products. It helps to keep in check whether a safe, hygienic and clean environment is ensured during livestock breeding, processing, supply, transportation and storing. Meat quality assurance includes inspections, lab meat quality testing, audits, meat quality control and meat safety certification as per the guidelines and regulations of the destination market. Lab meat quality testing involves freshness control, grading the meat, tests to identify any residue, stability and shelf life. Meat quality testing is a part of meat quality assurance and they majorly ensure that safe, clean and good manufacturing practices are followed in the complete meat supply chain. Additionally, meat quality control includes tracking of the entire process, identifying if any deviations occur, verifying and maintaining a standard procedure. All these processes are done to eliminate, reduce or prevent food safety hazards. With timely quality testing of meat and meat products, a systematic verification as per regulations can be done, and corrective actions can be taken whenever there is a deviation from the set standards.\nWith increasing consumer demand for good quality, safe, ready to eat food products round the year, it is important to take a preventive approach to maintain the highest level of meat quality assurance to ensure a stronghold in the national and international market, thus increasing share in the meat trade including exports. Manufacturers must deploy production processes according to the principles of HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point), as well as ensure hygienic optimum conditions. HACCP Meat Quality Control Checks ensures conducting hazard analysis, pinpoint critical control points, and establish critical limits, monitoring procedures, establishing corrective actions, recordkeeping and verification of established procedures. All this coupled with safe and hygienic operating procedures will provide the highest level of meat quality assurance. A quality auditor or inspector when inspects, provides a meat safety certificate. This certification is recognised nationally or globally and provides brand recognition in respective markets. Meat safety certificate would help mitigate risk, save time and money, ensure better market access and inspire confidence in consumers and help grab a bigger market altogether.\nADDRESSING THE FOOD SAFETY CHALLENGE\nAddressing food safety challenges is possible, only when the industry takes efforts to improve with changing trends and developments at the forefront of food safety and quality assurance as per regulations and adopting best practices to make food risk-free with the best use of scientific processes, safe for the overall environment. The key to addressing challenges is being informed, accepting change, adopting the evolving developments and implementing new processes with ever-changing and fast-growing times.\nThe first step towards having a successful business and establishing a brand name for your meat industry, is to have a scientific approach to ensure food safety. For this, you would need a robust quality assurance system and a good tie up with the best of the meat quality testing facility and meat safety certificate provider. We help meat industry suppliers, manufacturers and retailers to ensure that the meat and poultry in their supply chains is manufactured to high standards, stored and distributed under the right temperature conditions, and is compliant with local and international.

On weekends? Do your employees know how to check to make sure that perishable food at your facility is kept at the right temperature at all times? Do they know what actions to take if they notice a non-standard temperature reading or a failure to meet a critical control point?\nIf you’re responsible for quality assurance in your plant, you’re already aware that temperature monitoring and quality checklist execution aren’t as simple as it may seem to outsiders. You’re only one person—and paper checklists and constant check-ins can only get your employees so far. Not only that, the amount of labor spent on this manual process is expensive. There is a better way.\nImplementing the right digital HACCP system, including automated temperature monitoring and tablet-based HACCP checklists can help improve your operation efficiency, save time and save thousands of dollars. Even if your plant only spends one hour a day checking on refrigeration temps, automating this process will eliminate 365 hours of unnecessary labor spend annually, which adds significantly to the bottom line. A well-designed system will pay for itself time and time again.\nAutomated Processes\nIt’s not news that human beings are prone to error, even under the best of conditions. In the real world, fatigue and time pressures can further increase the odds of mistakes and oversights. That’s why, when it comes to meat processing, it’s unwise to rely on manual monitoring solutions (e.g., having someone check the thermometer every hour or so).\nAutomating your temperature monitoring processes ensures that things happens on schedule and with less chance of error—and zero chance of human error.\nIn addition, automation can help to reduce the time spent doing manual checks, allowing your staff to perform more duties quickly and efficiently.\nFinally, a system that automatically records temperature and humidity and transmits data wirelessly to the cloud ensures that it’s easy to access (and all in one place) come audit time.\nContinuous Monitoring\nTemporary power outages or other technical problems in your cold holding units may cause temperatures to rise above 41 degrees, putting food items at potential risk. When this happens, the problem may go undetected if there is no solution in place that senses and alerts you when temperatures fall outside acceptable parameters.\nU.S. law imposes harsh penalties on meat processing plants that do not have the capability to control the temperature of their refrigerated foods. 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(4) forbids the sale of adulterated foods that have been “prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.”\nDue to the ongoing enforcement of this law, plants that lack proper temperature-control methods can expect to rack up substantial expenses linked to processing mishaps that result in food spoilage.\nA 24/7/365 automated monitoring system with effective alerting is the only reliable way to help prevent these issues from arising.\nLook for a product that allows you to access real-time data on any electronic dashboard at any time.\nAround-the-clock monitoring aids in preventing equipment failure by generating data that the repair team can use to analyze performance trends.\nKeeping your meat stored at the right temperature at all times isn’t an option—it’s a necessity for safety and for your bottom line.\nKeeping your meat stored at the right temperature at all times isn’t an option—it’s a necessity for safety and for your bottom line.\nDigital checklists can help reduce time and human error and help improve operational efficiency.\nDigital checklists can help reduce time and human error and help improve operational efficiency.\nIf your coolers or freezers aren’t storing your meat at the proper temperature you need to be confident that you’ll be alerted as soon as the problem arises.\nIf your coolers or freezers aren’t storing your meat at the proper temperature you need to be confident that you’ll be alerted as soon as the problem arises.\n24/7 Alerts\nAny monitoring solution is limited in effectiveness if you can’t respond to adverse events in time to avoid spoilage of perishable food. You need a system in place that can send alerts immediately (even during a power outage) so that authorized personnel can take action even if they’re in another location.\nYou want a system that alerts you when temperature is out of range.\nAlthough text message and email alerts are informative, a direct phone call from a live agent is the BEST possible option during serious failures, enabling authorized personnel to intervene as soon as possible. When you’re dealing with freezers and coolers, this can mean the difference between a minor processing hiccup and a major incident that leads to thousands of dollars in wasted food.\nMake sure the product you choose is equipped with sensors that can handle the challenge of transmitting through stainless steel, concrete structures, and insulated cold-holding units.\nDigital Checklists\nGoing digital with your checklists is the best way to ensure that employees perform all the tasks required of them and that they have access to all pertinent data. Among other benefits, digital checklists can be accessed from any Internet-connected device, whereas paper-based types cannot.\nA well-designed digital checklist system will make it a breeze to monitor and track daily tasks.\nDigital checklists allow you to reduce expenses associated with paper while simultaneously lowering your impact on the environment.\nLook for a system that incorporates a variety of checklists including operational, self-auditing, cleaning, front of the house, back of the house, temperature, time, and warming/cooling logs.\nWhile a trained staff of professionals is a necessity in this industry, it’s not enough to help you stay compliant, efficient, and ahead of your competition. An automated temperature monitoring and electronic checklist system offers the modern meat processing plant a broad range of HACCP-compliant, money-saving benefits. Making a single investment now can make a world of difference tomorrow.\nQuality control of meat and chicken\n2. Meat quality is normally defined by the compositional quality (lean to fat ratio) and the palatability factors such as visual appearance, smell, firmness, juiciness, tenderness, and flavour.\n3. Visual Identification The visual identification of quality meat is based on colour, marbling and waterholding capacity. Marbling is small streaks of fat that are found within the muscle and can be seen in the meat cut. Marbling has a beneficial effect on juiciness and flavour of meat. Meat should have a normal colour that is uniform throughout the entire cut. Beef, lamb, and pork should also have marbling throughout the meat.\n4. Smell Another quality factor is smell. The product should have a normal smell. This will be different for each of the species (i.e. beef, pork, chicken), but should vary only slightly within the species. Any rancid or strange smelling meat should be avoided. Firmness Meat should appear firm rather than soft. When handling the retail package, it should be firm, but not tough.\n5. Juiciness Juiciness depends on the amount of water retained in a cooked meat product. Juiciness increases flavour, helps soften meat - making it easier to chew, and stimulates saliva production in the mouth. Water retention and lipid content determine juiciness. Marbling and fat around edges helps hold in water. Water losses are from evaporation and drip losses. Meat aging can increase water retention and therefore increases juiciness.\n6. Tenderness Has been linked to several factors, such as the animal's age, sex or the muscle location. One important way to tenderize meat is by aging. Carcasses are aged by holding them at refrigeration temperatures for extended periods of time after slaughter and initial chilling. Flavour Flavour and aroma are intertwined to create the sensation the consumer has during eating. These perceptions rely on the smell through the nose and on the sensations of salty, sweet, sour and bitter on the tongue. Meat flavour is affected by type of species, diet, cooking method and method of preservation (e.g. smoked or cured).\n7. Meat processing hygiene is part of Quality Management (QM) of meat plants and refers to the hygienic measures to be taken during the various processing steps in the manufacture of meat products.\n8. There are 3 principles of meat hygiene, which are crucial for meat processing operations. 1) Prevent microbial contamination of raw materials, intermediate (semi- manufactured) goods and final products during meat product manufacture through absolute cleanliness of tools, working tables, machines as well as hands and outfits of personnel. 2) Minimize microbial growth in raw materials, semi-manufactured goods and final products by storing them at a low temperature. 3) Reduce or eliminate microbial contamination by applying heat treatment at the final processing stage for extension of shelf life of products\n9. The above three principles guide meat hygiene programmes in the further processing of meat. In particular, the hygienic treatment of meat before reaching the processing stage is of utmost importance for the processing quality of the meat. Failures in slaughter hygiene, meat cutting and meat handling,transportation and in the hygiene of by-products and additives will all contribute to quality losses and deterioration of the final processed meat products.\n10. Highly contaminated raw meat is unsuitable for further processing. Final products made from hygienically deficient raw meat materials are unattractive in colour, tasteless or untypical in taste with reduced shelf life due to heavy microbial loads. Moreover, there is also the risk of presence of food poisoning microorganisms, which can pose a considerable public health hazard\n11. Carcass contamination during slaughtering (red dots) Unavoidable –keep as low as possible. Meat cutting No reduction of contamination possible, but further contamination should be prevented. Further processing No reduction of contamination possible, but prevent further contamination and create challenges / hurdles for microbial growth and survival (aw, preservatives). Heat treatment of final product Pasteurization (approx. 80°C): Substantial reduction of contamination, but products need refrigeration. Sterilization (above 100°C): Total elimination of contamination, products can be stored without refrigeration (in sealed food containers).\n12. Quality Management Schemes (QM) have two useful schemes which can be applied For the sanitary quality and safety related to meat processing 1) Good Hygienic Practices (GHP) and 2) Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) Scheme.\n13. GHP follows general hygienic rules and applies recognized hygienic principles as well as laws and regulations issued by the competent authorities, referring to meat and meat products, equipment, premises and personnel. GHP schemes are not factory specific, they apply to all types of meat plants. They are intended to establish and maintain acceptable hygienic standards in relevant meat operations. The FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission has issued a new CODE OF HYGIENIC PRACTICE FOR MEAT in 2005 (CAC/RCP 58-2005). However in principle, GHP schemes remain interchangeable for similar types of meat plants.\n14. Appropriate functional plant layout and sanitary design of equipment Raw materials that meet hygiene quality standards Processing methods that allow safe handling of food Appropriate waste and pest control measures Appropriate sanitation procedures (cleaning and disinfection) Compliance with potable water criteria Functional cold chain Regular examination of health and personal hygiene of staff Regular training of staff on hygiene requirements\n15. DONT’S OF SLAUGHTER HOUSE WORKERS\n16. HACCP are factory and product specific strictly sanitary control schemes that shall prevent, detect, control and/or reduce to save levels accidentally occurring hazards to consumers’ health. Despite GHP in place, accidental hazards cannot be ruled out and may occur at any processing step of the individual meat product.\n17. In meat processing plants hazards may be provoked by failures such as: batches of incoming raw meat materials with abnormal tissues or heavy contamination, breakdowns in refrigeration, failure in cooking/sterilization operations, abnormal pH or aw in raw or finished products, errors in levels of application of curing salts and other additives, technical problems in sealing of vacuum packages or cans with the risk of recontamination. HACCP schemes serve as additional alarm systems in the interest of consumer protection to prevent such problems occuring.\n18. Every single meat product with product specific technology requires a specifically designed individual HACCP scheme. As a precondition for implementing HACCP concepts, hazard analysis and risk assessment referring to meat plant specific processing methods or products, have to be carried out. Critical control points (CCPs) have to be identified, critical limits be established and monitoring systems properly implemented\n19. The HACCP scheme is subdivided into seven consecutive steps 1. Hazard analysis and risk assessment The first principles requires initially the exact description of the products to be fabricated, including product composition, texture/structure, processing details packaging and if applicable chemical and microbiological criteria. Examples for hazards in meat processing Biological hazards: Parasites , bacteria , moulds , viruses Physical hazards: Rest of unwanted materials (glass, bone fragments, animal teeth, plastics, stones) Chemical hazards: Contaminants (heavy metals, chemical solvents, cleaning and disinfection compounds) Residues (veterinary drugs, feed additives, pesticides) Food additives with risk of overdoses (nitrate/nitrite, chemical preservatives)\n20. A CCP is defined as any point or procedure in a specific food system, where loss of control may result in an unacceptable health risk. CCPs can be located at any point along the production line of a specific meat product, where biological, physical and chemical hazards may occur and where such risks can be controlled and/or eliminated. CCPs should only be established, where firm methods for control and monitoring can be applied.\n21. unloading bay for raw materials (meat and non- meat ingredients), cold storage rooms, meat cutting and preparation facilities, facility for handling non-meat additives, meat comminuting units (grinders, bowl choppers etc.), filling equipment and casings, heat treatment facilities (smokehouses, cooking vats, autoclaves), packaging equipment and materials (including canning), cold store for final products,\n22. 3. Establishment of Critical Limits for each CCP Critical limits correspond to the extreme (highest and lowest) values acceptable from the point of view of product safety. Examples Visual check of damage to packaged incoming raw materials Visual check of contamination of raw materials Temperature control of meat pH of incoming meat (e.g. < 6.0 for pork, < 5.7 for beef) Visual check during meat cutting and grading Moisture content (aw ) Additives Control of pasteurization parameters (ensure sufficient cooking, measured as core temperatures in products, e.g. 74°C) Control of sterilization temperature and time for canned products\n23. 4. Establishment of a monitoring system for each CCP Monitoring is the regular/periodic measurement or observation at a CCP to determine whether a critical limit or target level has been met Monitoring at CCPs should deliver results rapidly in order to enable corrective action during processing. Lengthy analytical testing is not practicable in the context.\n24. 5. Establishment of corrective actions Corrective actions are those actions to be taken either when monitoring results show that A CCP has deviated from its specified critical limit or target level or when monitoring results indicate a trend towards loss of control Action taken must reduce to safe level or eliminate the actual or potential hazard identified. Corrective actions are for example Reject incoming meat with too high internal temperatures Adjust temperature for refrigerated storage and transport of meat Remove with clean knives minimal visual contamination of meat surface, reject heavily contaminated meat Adjust cooking and sterilization parameters (temperature/time) Reject meat with too high pH\n25. 6. Establishment of verification procedures Procedures are needed to ensure that the HACCP system is working correctly. Particular attention must be given to the monitoring frequency, which may be daily or several times a day or more frequently. 7. Establishment of documents and records These documents serve for the competent authorities to evaluate the efficacy of the HACCP procedure carried out at the plant. Records also help to trace causes of problems that were encountered during past production.\nQUALITY CONTROL IN THE MEAT INDUSTRY\nThe Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) is a preventive system that tries to guarantee the safety and food innocuousness, anticipating the protection and correction of failures, improving the quality costs for faults of microbiological, physical and chemical type, and saving almost the final super control, which though it allows a relative guarantee of the product, its consequence will be the destruction of the product in case of detection of the failure too much late, with the consequent incremental cost. In this work, the specific hazards which can be found in the slaughter line of ostriches, the preventive measurements that can be applied in the slaughterhouse, the surveillance systems to implement, the corrective actions foreseen and the control records to be kept by the plant are described in detail. Putting in practice these knowledge will allow, to any slaughterhouse of ostriches, a self-control of its productions based on the HACCP system.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "5db5f0df-3ad4-48de-bb64-7c8b882d362a", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "06ef6d1b-fbfa-4492-a0b4-4ed4226908ae", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "113966", "creator": "chupei", "data_id": "0f3e1550-27ad-40b0-9ee4-49a517936aac", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "why": "广告"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "e0b44235-f26f-4aba-8c5e-b80926281512", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001579", "creator": "jinzhenjiang", "data_id": "f563fc9a-b9c1-40e4-9393-db9114f9537e", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "why": "不通顺"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "051560", "creator": "zengzhiyuan", "data_id": "0b667de3-ec3b-4534-b202-5da08f5baf61", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

There are more than twice the number of different orchids than there are different birds, and she can barely keep up with the birds. Still, she catalogues the avian content of her garden, listens to their song, peacocks and all, and writes letters.\nA long time ago, much longer ago than you would guess from how she looks, she had daughters. It is a sad and tiring story, but it comes down to this: The constellations are graveyards for those most adored by the gods. It is her lover that holds them up.\nSo Pleione writes letters. The birds carry them to the highest heights, to the pillars of the world. Her catalogue records each and every one in their flight. She copies out what she sends, and takes dictation from her winged companions on their return. In moments of extreme loneliness she plucks an orchid from the earth, grinds the twin bulbs to flour, and combines the powder with milk and the vanilla she grows. The brew is a powerful aphrodisiac. It sends her into dreams of how her daughters were made. Her own hands become those of Atlas. He lifts her up, and it is like it was before he took every burning orb into his reach, before Pleione was left alone.\nThere are other types of orchids in the garden. Orchids that would kill Pleione within the hour. But she has been promised a place in the night sky. It is a threat, that she will become a burning thing in the cold, and her weight will add to Atlas’ burden.\nInstead she tends her garden. She labels birds. It is a kind of quiet resistance. It will last forever.\n*****\nDee Harding used to be an urban legend, but worked out a little bit, and can now touch things and push furniture around.

This would usually make a slight difference, but since layers are used in the new look, it makes sense to give them a more specific interpretation.\nBut, it can also mean nothing.

Raised in varying artistic and musical upbringings, the duo’s album is spotted with guests that lead to a spattering of aural delicacies and differentiations.\nHama’s roots in classical violin and piano training works in combination with Wells’ jazz conditioning and vocal experiences from Athens to Atlanta. A subtle mix of cinematic grandiose with campfire quaintness, Leyode’s album is fittingly titled (the ellipsis really is part of the title).\nAlthough the songs are more appropriate for an evening of quiet reading or journal writing, the soothing nature of the album is not to call it boring, but rather, less than dynamic. The group says so itself as its music is described as “scenic beats,” serving exactly that purpose of establishing a landscape that, although spacious and beautiful, relies greatly on the listener’s mood and interaction with the music to prove moving or effective.\nConceived from an experimentation involving French new wave film clips, Leyode takes you on a slow-motion escalator through the emotional phases of your life you never even knew you missed. With electronic-infused mixes of soft vocals, dissonant chords and an abundance of song samples, this twosome creates an album that, at the very least, can be called truly different.

Again.\nJustine was totally right about crows. I wish I hadn’t been so hard on them so many years ago.\nCrows are extremely smart. They learn at least 250 different calls, and communicate in different dialects according to family, social group or in general. They are as smart as primates in many ways. They are omnivores and that makes their brains bigger and more complex. They mate for life. At one point during the PBS Nature documentary I was watching, I was reminded of Hitchcock’s “The Birds.”\nBut crows have hard lives. They rarely make it past adolescence: often getting picked off by hawks, or hit by cars.\nIt also seems crows feel emotional pain. There is a legend about crows having funerals, and it turns out this phenomenon has some scientific evidence. Crows generally are part of a social group.

What paints James?\n-\nNot really devil’s advocate and some good points made. The apocalypse scenario is interesting and a possible outcome. I do wonder if a Telford kit swap approach may be viable even at smaller shows, but the problem being manning it. I suppose there is no easy solution and a bit like the the name of the forum will divide opinion for eternity. But at least we seem to be able to discuss it like adults. 🤭\n-\nTis a very interesting conundrum! I'm afraid I primarily got to shows (when I can) to buy, be it from traders or under the table sales. In reality I've probably bought no more than two/three kits from UTS and a significant proportion from MFS, simply because he's often had what I'm looking for. I have on the other hand done UTS myself and I know for a fact that on the second occasion I did better than a trader that was at the show. Why, as he had new latest releases available? Probably due to his demeanour and approach to customers. From my sources I'm aware that he was upset and you may well be right in saying he had every right to be. But I was getting rid of a lot of OOP stuff that he wouldn't have as he didn't trade in second hand. Clearly at that particular show I was lucky and had what people were looking for. But to finally get to my point! Every single penny of what I made went back into the hobby through traders. I didn't spend it on wine, women, or beer even, but plastic kits and sundries. It's a bit like energy in the universe, it's never lost, just changed in form. In fact Duncan did quite well out of that sales frenzy! I like the chance to browse at what others are disposing off because of taste changes etc and if that is stopped then it may just deter me, and others from attending. Telford is different as there are so many traders and I'm there to buy! I do like Steves idea of an area where under table stuff is actually away from the displays, partly as it'll save me time walking round all the club tables. However I'm not sure how it would be done as part of my enjoyment is sat nattering to the friends of made over the years on said displays and I probably wouldn't bother if I had to sit on a table all lonesome. So my 'dead' stash would stay with me (Don't do eBay) and not get recycled into the hobby freeing up cash for me to blow with traders. So a slightly long winded opinion that may not be very popular, but it's what it is! Rich\n-\ngreen monster factor Make 'em jealous!

After a fair bit of research I can’t praise the kit itself enough. It really is superb. Even the ejector seats are pretty good representations of the K-36L, which is very different from the DM which another 1/48 Yak-130 manufacturer seems to have provided! If you like the ‘Mitten’ buy it, just check the canopy, but accept it may not be perfect.\n-\nEduard 1/48 Bf109E-1 2/JG77 Aug 1939\nDrichc replied to BlackMike Models's topic in GalleryThat is lovely and in a not often seen scheme.

My hunger to read more and to discover about the personality of the Holy Spirit consumed me and still does. I further on obtained other titles like Holy Spirit My Senior Partner by Pastor Yonggi Cho and others from different authors. I gleaned from those books trying to find more about the Holy Spirit and how I could create a personal relationship with Him.\n\nThrough my desire and hunger, I also obtained video tapes and other resource materials which assisted my understanding of the personality and functionality of the Holy Spirit.\n\nToday, I am glad to inform you that my hunger to fellowship with the Holy Spirit has not dwindled and through my personal studies and encounters, my knowledge and understanding of the personality and functionality of the Holy Spirit in the life and ministry of every Christian has produced this excellent book.\n\nMy prayer is that, as you read this book, may you find the person of the Holy Spirit and fellowship with Him in a personal way.\n\nDedication\n\nI dedicate this book to Pastor Benny Hinn.\n\nFrom the first time I read his book, \"Good Morning Holy Spirit\" as a first year student in the university, my life was totally transformed. I got to know who the Holy Spirit is and how I could fellowship with Him daily as a Christian.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nJohn Ebo Opare- You have been a great blessing, thank you for designing this cover page.

Thank you very much.\n\nChapter 1\n\n### The SPIRIT OF HOLINESS\n\nWho is the Holy Spirit? Do you have the Holy Spirit? Are you filled with the Spirit of God? Do you have a personal relationship with the Holy Spirit? These and many more questions about who the Holy Spirit is and His importance in the life and ministry of every believer should be the interest of every Christian.\n\nThe Holy Scriptures describe the Spirit of God in so many ways. Two of these unique descriptions stand out throughout the scriptures;\n\n1. The Holy Spirit\n\n2. The Holy Ghost.\n\nThese names describe His nature, His personality and how He functions and works in the life of every Christian. It is therefore imperative for every believer to get to know the Spirit of God.\n\nThe name \"Holy Spirit\" is the Greek word \"hagios pneuma\" which describes the Spirit of God as;\n\n1. The Sacred Spirit\n\n2. The Most Holy Spirit\n\nThese names describe His nature as holy, pure, sacred and righteous. The Holy Spirit who has these attributes in His nature is therefore able to bring about true change in the lives and attitudes of Christians who receive Him and fellowship with Him in personal way. He is the source of repentance and true change in a life surrendered to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\nThe Holy Spirit was at work in the life of Jesus Christ as the Spirit of Holiness. Because of this holiness and sinless nature in Jesus Christ, the power of death could not keep Jesus bound in the grave. The Bible states clearly that the Spirit of Holiness proved that Jesus Christ is the Son of God with power when He raised Jesus Christ from the dead.\n\nAnd declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the **SPIRIT OF HOLINESS** , by the resurrection from the dead.\n\nRomans 1:4\n\nThis is why it is imperative for every believer to receive the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of Holiness in his or her life. If the Spirit of Holiness who lived in our Lord Jesus Christ was able to raise Jesus Christ from the dead, then we as the children of God born again in Christ Jesus have this blessed hope of our own resurrection when we pass on from this present life.\n\nBut now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.\n\nFor since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.\n\nFor as in Adam all die, **even so in Christ shall all be made alive**.\n\n1Corinthians 15:20-22\n\nThe Spirit of Holiness in the life of a Christian is also able to help that believer to put to death every evil nature of sin reigning in him or her. Millions of people are currently living under the dominion and the influence of various sins and evil habits and it only takes the power of the Holy Spirit; the Spirit of Holiness to set them free from such bondage.\n\nFor if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: **but if ye through the Spirit (the Spirit of Holiness) do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.**\n\nRomans 8:13\n\nIt is the Spirit of Holiness who is able to make sinful people like you and me holy, righteous and blameless before God our Heavenly Father through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\nWho shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\n1Corinthians 1:8\n\nIf you surrender your life to God through His Son Jesus Christ our Lord and you allow the Spirit of Holiness to live and function inside you fully, you will be free from the power and dominion of Sin because who so ever the Son sets free shall be free indeed.\n\nIf the Son therefore shall make you free, **ye shall be free indeed**.\n\nJohn 8:36\n\nNow, how does the Son of God make a person free from the power, the dominion and influence that Sin has over a human soul? How does the Holy Spirit functioning as the Spirit of Holiness in the life of a Christian able to break that power of sin?\n\nBut YE SHALL **RECEIVE POWER** (inherent strength and ability), after that the Holy Ghost (the Spirit of Holiness) is come upon you...\n\nActs 1:8\n\nOnce you come into Christ; once you surrender your life and heart to Jesus Christ pledging your allegiance to Him, you are immediately translated from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God, and in the Kingdom of God, there is no condemnation. In the Kingdom of God sin doesn't have power, dominion or a hold on the soul of any redeemed man.\n\nWho hath **delivered us from the power of darkness** , and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.\n\nColossians 1:13\n\nThere is therefore now **no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus** , who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\n\nRomans 8:1\n\nFurther on, the Spirit of Holiness living inside a Christian is able to generate a greater power inside the believer so that that Christian is able to resist and overcome the power and the influence of sin in his life.\n\nYe are of God, little children, and **have overcome them** : **because greater is He that is in you** , than he that is in the world.\n\n1John 4:4\n\nSubmit yourselves therefore to God. **Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.**\n\nJames 4:7\n\nThe Holy Spirit; the Greater one lives inside every Christian. It is He who gives the Christian the strength to overcome sin, the ability to deal with challenges and the grace to topple over hurdles in our lives.\n\nThis is why fellowship with the Holy Spirit is a MUST for every Christian who wants to live a successful and fruitful life being pleasing unto God; fulfilling the call of God upon his or her life. Remember! God has called every Christian to have fellowship with His Son Jesus Christ.\n\nGod is faithful, by whom **ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ** our Lord.\n\n1Corinthians 1:9\n\nHow is this fellowship going to happen since Jesus Christ is not in His fleshly form on earth? We can have a fruitful fellowship and interaction with our Lord Jesus Christ through His Spirit; the Holy Ghost and His Word.\n\nIf you are currently struggling with any sin, addiction or bad habit which is gradually destroying you and your faith in God, then kindly pray the prayer below in all sincerity and openness of heart to God our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ so you can be set free.\nPrayer for Salvation and Freedom From The Bondage of Sin.\n\nHeavenly Father, I thank you for my life, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die for my sins and redeem me from darkness into your eternal life. From today, I accept this great salvation our Lord Jesus Christ has provided for me. I believe in my heart that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and I boldly confess and accept Him to be my Lord and personal saviour. Amen.\n\nFather, as I have received Jesus Christ into my life, I understand from your word in John 8 verse 36 that \"If the Son has made me free, then I am free indeed\". I therefore stand fast in this freedom that Jesus Christ, the Son of God has given me and I boldly confess that I am free from (mention the various addictions and evil habits by name),..........................., and..............., and......................., and...................and............., and every other sin and evil at work in my life.\n\nI receive the promise of the Father; the Holy Spirit right now to be upon me, to be in me and to be with me every day of my life. Holy Spirit, help me to develop a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ and with our Heavenly Father as I do with you. I welcome you to teach me the Word of God and help me understand the scriptures and how to apply them in my daily life.\n\nFinally, Father, I surrender my life to you, make me a vessel you work through and use me to be a blessing to my friends, my family and to millions of souls world-wide. Use me to bring joy and salvation to homes and to families and may I live a life pleasing unto you every day of my life by the power of the Holy Spirit in Jesus name. Amen.\nChapter 2\n\n### The SPIRIT OF TRUTH\n\nWhat is the truth? How does a child of God differentiate what the truth is from what is a lie? Kindly remember that spiritual things cannot be carnally described or easily understood by natural men. The truth for the Christian is neither defined nor measured by the standards or the wisdom of this world.\n\n**But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know** **them** **, because they are spiritually discerned.**\n\n1Corinthians 2:14\n\nOur Lord Jesus Christ as stated in His prayer in John chapter 17, revealed what the truth is for the child of God and the powerful effect of \"sanctification\" that the truth of the Word of God has on the Christian.\n\nThey (Christians) are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. **Sanctify them through thy truth: THY WORD IS TRUTH.**\n\nJohn 17:16-17\n\nThe Word of God as the ability to sanctify Christians from all kinds of unrighteousness. The word \"to sanctify\" is the Greek word \"hagiazo\" which is translated as;\n\n1.To make holy.\n\n2.To purify.\n\n3.To consecrate.\n\n4.To approve.\n\n5.To set something aside for a special use.\n\n6.To bless.\n\n7.To venerate\n\nSo then, how does this sanctification work? How am I cleansed and made holy through the Word of God?\n\nFirstly, the Holy Spirit, manifested as the Spirit of Truth, is the one who does the sanctifying; hence He is also called the Sanctifier or the Spirit of Sanctification.\n\nAs Christians we can be venerated from sin or any form of unrighteousness when we through the Spirit of Truth discover ourselves in the Word of God and also discover the provisions for justification that God has stated in His Word.\n\nFor example, the scripture clearly states that as Christians we have an advocate with God the Heavenly Father who is Jesus Christ the righteous. Now Jesus Christ is not only our saviour as Christians; He is also our justifier and the only person righteous enough to represent Christians at the highest court of power- before God; the creator of the heavens and the earth.\n\nMy little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:\n\n1John 2:1\n\nNow what does this mean? It clearly means that it is only Christians who have a lawyer before God. It is only Christians who can be justified and venerated before God. It is only Christians who can plead their case before God through Jesus Christ and be justified.\n\nJesus Christ as the advocate of Christians is righteous in His nature and He is the only one qualified enough to represent a person before the Heavenly throne. Why is this so? Because He is called **JESUS THE RIGHTEOUS** and in Him there is no sin.\n\nAnd ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.\n\n1John 3:5\n\nThis is one of the reasons we must continue to preach the gospel of salvation to the lost and dying souls in this world. We must **TELL THEM** that there is a justifier, there is an advocate and there is a redeemer of the souls of men before God.\n\nHow does Jesus Christ justify Christians before God? He justifies Christians before God by declaring the children of God as holy and blameless through **His blood** and **His own righteous nature**.\n\nIn whom we (Christians) have **redemption** (justification) **through his blood** , the forgiveness (veneration) of sins, according to the riches of his grace.\n\nEphesians 1:7\n\nFor he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; **that we** (Christians) **might be made the righteousness of God in him.**\n\n2Corinthians 5:21\n\nBut of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us (Christians) wisdom, and **righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption** :\n\n1Corinthians 1:30\n\nIn this revelation and understanding, I as a Christian am justified before God through the Blood of Jesus Christ that was shed for me on the Cross of Calvary.\n\nAs a Christian I am righteous and holy before God because Jesus Christ has made me holy and righteous.\n\nAs a Christian I must not forget that I can NEVER be justified before God by my own actions or good deeds. My redemption and justification is only by grace through my faith in Jesus Christ.\n\n**For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves:** **it is** **the gift of God:**\n\nNot of works, lest any man should boast.\n\nEphesians 2:8-9\n\nThis is why it is so important for a Christian to know the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of Truth. Without the presence and influence of the Spirit of Truth, a person will not understand or gain any insights into the revelations and provisions that God has made available to all men through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\nSecondly, as Christians we can be justified and venerated from our sins and any form of unrighteousness if we acknowledge and confess to God our Heavenly Father that we are sinful in our earthly nature and that we have fallen short of His glory. Then and only then can we plead for the blood of Jesus Christ to cleanse us and make us holy before God.\n\nThis sincerity of heart and the acknowledgement of our sinful earthly nature is revealed to us by the Spirit of Truth living inside every child of God.\n\nFor all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\n\nRomans 3:23\n\nIf we (Christians) say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another **and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin**. If we (Christians) say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. **If we confess our sins** , he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\n\n1John 1:6-9\n\nThrough the Spirit of Truth, a Christian can be sanctified from his sins and set apart as God's choice vessel.\n\nBut in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. **If a man therefore purges himself** from these, **he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use,** **and** **prepared unto every good work.**\n\n2 Timothy 2:20-21\n\nThe Holy Spirit; the Spirit of Truth is also called the Spirit of Reality. He is able to remove the blindness and the scales off the eyes and minds of unbelievers so they can see the glorious Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ and be saved.\n\nIn whom the god of this world **hath blinded the minds** of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.\n\n2Corinthians 4:4\n\nThen Ananias answered, Lord, **I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem** : And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name. But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel: For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake. And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; **and putting his hands on him said** , Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, **that thou mightest receive thy sight** , **and be filled with the Holy Ghost**. **And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales** : and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.\n\nActs 9:13-18\n\nThe Spirit of Reality reveals the \"truth of life\" to Christians who maybe deluded about this life and what God requires of them. Have you ever asked yourself \"What does God require of me?\", \"Why was I created?\" or \"To what purpose is my life on earth?\"\n\nMoses, the servant of God came to that point in his life and ministry where he had to ask the children of Israel what life meant to them and what they thought God required of them.\n\n**And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee?** But to **fear the LORD** thy God, to **walk in all his ways** , and **to love him** , and **to serve the LORD** thy God **with all thy heart and with all thy soul** , **to keep the commandments** of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good.\n\nDeuteronomy 10:12-13\n\nToday, as you are reading this book, take time to ask yourself similar questions and get wisdom from the response that Moses, the servant of God gave to the children of Israel. That response clearly stated in the above mentioned scripture should help shape and correct your understanding about the reality of life and what God is expecting you to do with the short life He has given you.\n\nThe Spirit of Truth has the ability to successfully guide every Christian to living a meaningful and a purpose driven life.\n\nHowbeit when he, **the Spirit of truth, is come** , **he will guide you into all truth** (reality): for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.\n\nJohn 16:13\n\nFurthermore, when the reality of life revealed in the Word of God is manifested to a Christian, he is able to see life in a very different way than he did before.\n\nThe revelation of this truth empowers such a Christian to lay down his worldly pursuits, worldly lusts, worldly dreams and his worldly ambitions to search for the call of God on his life and to seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness so he can fulfil his calling.\n\nBut what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss **for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord** : for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, **that I may win Christ**.\n\nPhilippians 3:7-8\n\nOur Lord Jesus Christ also made it very clear that Christians should have the right priorities. The varieties of food to eat, the assortments of drinks to drink, the types of clothes to be worn, or the standard of life to be lived must never replace the vision and call of God.\n\nTherefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? For after all these things do the Gentiles seek: for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. **But seek ye FIRST the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.**\n\nMathew 6:31-33\n\nThe Holy Spirit; the Spirit of Truth and Reality is that same Spirit who is able to bring Christians back to their right senses when we have erred or taken the wrong path in life.\n\nThere is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.\n\nProverbs 14:12\n\nIn the gospel of Luke, we see a very clear example of how the Spirit of Truth and Reality functions. How He is able to bring a child of God back to his right senses and return him to his father's house after this child had wasted his life and the inheritance he received from his father.\n\n**And when he came to himself (came to his senses)** , he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, **and I perish with hunger!** **I will arise and go to my father** , and will **say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, And am no more worthy to be called thy son** : make me as one of thy hired servants. **And he arose, and came to his father**. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.\n\nLuke 15:17-20\n\nAs soon as the Spirit of Reality manifested Himself to this young man in this scripture, this young man once proud came to his senses, saw the reality of life and returned home. May the Spirit of Truth show us the reality of things, help us to return to our senses and correct us when we have erred. Amen!\n\nWhat then is the Truth and where can the Truth be found?\n\nThe truth for the Christian is the wisdom of God other than the wisdom of men.\n\nBut where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?\n\nJob 28:12\n\n1. The truth is the Word of God, written in the Holy Scriptures; the Bible.\n\n2.The truth is what one discovers from the Holy Scriptures concerning different situations.\n\n3.The truth is the revelations and insights you receive from the Word of God.\n\n4.The declarations, prophesies and the histories in the Word of God is the truth.\n\n5.The truth is the wisdom taught from the Word of God contrary to the wisdom of men.\n\n6.The truth is the preaching taught by and confirmed by the Holy Scriptures.\n\n7.The truth is explained in God manifesting Himself in human form as Jesus Christ to redeem mankind from sin and damnation and provide everyone an opportunity to eternal life with God.\n\n10 Powerful Manifestations of The Spirit of Truth\n\n1. The Spirit of Truth makes a Christian aware that he is holy and righteous in the sight of God through the blood of Jesus Christ shed on the Cross of Calvary.\n\n2.The Spirit of Truth convicts Christians of any form of unrighteousness and impurity in their lives.\n\n3.The Spirit of Truth equips Christians to be ready vessels for the Lord's use through the knowledge, insight and revelations of the Word of God.\n\n4.The Spirit of Truth assesses Christians to meet God's approval through studying, meditating and understanding of the Word of God.\n\n5.Christians are set aside for God's special use through the wisdom, knowledge and understanding gleaned from the Word of God by the influence of the Spirit of Truth.\n\n6.The Word of God is profitable unto all things; it addresses different areas of the daily lives of Christians so as to give direction, wisdom and counsel by the Spirit of Truth.\n\n7.Through the Spirit of Truth, Christians are empowered to obey the Word of God resulting in positive changes in attitudes and behaviour.\n\n8.The Spirit of Truth is able to guide all Christians to discovery of various truths in the Word of God.\n\n9. The Spirit of Truth has a voice; He is able to hear directly from Jesus Christ and relate what He hears to Christians through guidance.\n\nHowbeit when he **, the Spirit of truth** , is come, **he will guide you into all truth** : for he shall not speak of himself; **but whatsoever he shall hear,** **that** **shall he speak** : and he will shew you things to come.\n\nJohn 16:13\n\n10. The Spirit of Truth is able to show Christians the future and the reality of things to come\n\nHowbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak **: and he will shew you things to come.**\n\nJohn 16:13\nChapter 3\n\nThe COMFORTER\n\nBut **the Comforter** , which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\n\nJohn 14:26\n\nOur Lord Jesus Christ described the Holy Spirit as \"the Comforter\". This is a definite noun. The Holy Spirit was not described as \"one\" of the comforters but \"the Comforter\". This definite noun helps Christians to understand that we are not alone, we have not been abandoned to handle and overcome the challenges of this life alone; we have a helper, care-giver and a care-taker.\n\nThe word \"comforter\" is the Greek word \"parakletos\" which can be translated as;\n\n1.Comforter\n\n2.Intercessor.\n\n3.Helper\n\n4.Counsellor .\n\n5.An Advocate.\n\n6.A Standby.\n\n7.Strengthener\n\nFrom this definition, we understand that the Holy Spirit can function in the office of The Comforter in the life of every Christian.\n\n10 Important Roles The Comforter Plays In the Life Of Every Christian.\n\n1.The Comforter is able to assist Christians to recover from any form of loss.\n\n2.The Comforter provides counsel and advice to Christians through the word of wisdom.\n\n3.The Comforter is able to intercede for Christians in various crisis through the prayers of other Christians.\n\n4.The Comforter stands as a defence and a covering of protection for Christians against any onslaught of Satan.\n\n5.The Comforter is with every Christian during challenging and difficult situations. Even in those situations we can easily refer to as \"the valley of the shadow of death\".\n\n6.The Comforter acts as our advocate as Christians in different situations with or without our knowledge. He speaks, convicts and acts on behalf of Christians.\n\n7. The Comforter is able to change the heart and the mindset of people about believers at different levels of authority.\n\n8.The Comforter is able to strengthen every Christian to live a life pleasing unto God.\n\n9.The Comforter is also a standby; always ready to offer any assistance, direction concerning any field and help when called upon.\n\n10. He literally gives physical, psychological and spiritual strength to those who wait upon Him.\n\n5 Special Abilities Of The Comforter; The Holy Spirit\n\n1.The special ability to live with Christians forever, even in eternity with God.\n\nAnd I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, **that he may abide with you for ever.**\n\nJohn 14:16\n\n2. The special ability to respond to the name of Jesus Christ every time.\n\nBut the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, **whom the Father will send in my name** , he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\n\nJohn 14:26\n\n3.The special ability to teach Christians \"all things\".\n\nBut the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, **he shall teach you all things** , and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\n\nJohn 14:26\n\n4.The special ability to enhance the memory of Christians to recollect all things.\n\nBut the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, **and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.**\n\nJohn 14:26\n\n5.The special ability to convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.\n\nNevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:\n\nJohn 16:7-8\nChapter 4\n\n### An ALLOS OF JESUS CHRIST\n\nAnd I will pray the Father, and he shall give you **another** Comforter, that he may abide with you forever.\n\nJohn 14:16\n\n\"Another Comforter\" is a different description from the noun \"the Comforter\". The word \"another\" is the Greek word \"Allos\" which denotes;\n\n1.Another of the same kind.\n\n2.One similar to and with exact characteristics.\n\n3.One similar to and with exact functions and role as the first.\n\n4.One similar in performance to the original.\n\n5.A clone; exact copy in everything.\n\n6.An exact replicate of the original.\n\n7.An exact reproduction of the original.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the exact replicate of our Lord Jesus Christ. He plays the exact same role that Jesus Christ would have played in the life of every Christian. I believe that is why the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of Jesus.\n\nFor I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply **of the Spirit of Jesus Christ**.\n\nPhilippians 1:19\n\nI believe one of the reasons why our Lord Jesus Christ insisted on His departure and the arrival of the Holy Spirit was that; Jesus Christ was limited in His earthly body and could only be and function in one place per time.\n\nNevertheless I tell you the truth; **It is expedient for you that I go away** : for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; **but if I depart, I will send him unto you**.\n\nJohn 16:7\n\nBut His Spirit; the Holy Ghost, who is the exact copy of Him without this earthly body or its limitations would be able to be with every believer anywhere in this world all at the same time. Praise the Lord Jesus Christ!\n\nAnd I will pray the Father, and he shall give you (Christians) ANOTHER COMFORTER **that he may abide with you for ever** ; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: **but ye know him** ; **for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.** I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.\n\nJohn 14:16-18\n\nIsn't it amazing that the Holy Spirit is able to continue the works of Jesus Christ? The Allos of Jesus Christ is able accomplish great feats in the name of Jesus Christ through every Christian all over the world all at the same time or at different times?\n\nAs I am writing this book, other believers in other parts of the world may be doing the same or allowing themselves to be used by the Lord in accomplishing great works for Jesus Christ. All these are possible by the Spirit of Jesus Christ working in every Christian.\n\nFor it is God (the Holy Spirit) **which worketh in you** both **to will** and **to do** of his good pleasure.\n\nPhilippians 2:13\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ. Once a Christian is filled with the Holy Spirit at salvation, that believer has Jesus Christ (the greater one) living inside him.\n\nYe are of God, little children, and have overcome them: **because greater is he that is in you** , than he that is in the world.\n\n1John 4:4\nChapter 5\n\n### The EXCELLENT TEACHER\n\nBut the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he **shall teach you all things** , and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\n\nJohn 14:26\n\nOne of the primary functions of the Holy Spirit in the life of Christians is to play the role of a Teacher. Jesus Christ confirmed this role when He told the disciples that the Holy Spirit would teach them all things.\n\nTo \"teach\" is the Greek word \"didasko\" which is translated as;\n\n1.To impart knowledge.\n\n2.To instruct in a discipline.\n\n3.To have a discourse.\n\n4.To bring to light hidden and mysterious things.\n\n5.To educate.\n\n6.To enlighten minds.\n\n7.To civilize people in a particular discipline.\n\n8.To indoctrinate.\n\n9.To give revelations.\n\n10.To make someone understand a subject.\n\n11.To bring up new knowledge.\n\n12.To disclose reason and intelligence in a particular field.\n\n13.To impart wisdom.\n\n14.To train one to think and grow in a specific knowledge.\n\nWe understand from the scriptures that the teaching ministry of the Holy Spirit is expressed in 3 ways;\n\n1. Ability to teach \"All things\".\n\nThe Holy Spirit; the excellent teacher is able to teach Christians on every subject even beyond human understanding. He also has knowledge in every field of endeavour; what this means is that He can teach you and me to understand every subject.\n\nRemember Daniel, the Prophet of God in ancient history was divinely given skill and understanding in all matters.\n\nYea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation. And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, **I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.**\n\nDaniel 9:21-22\n\nBecause of this peculiar skill, understanding and many other gifts that were manifested in Daniel's life, he was able to serve at the highest level of government for several years in different political eras. Remember, Daniel was part of the captured Jewish slaves in Babylon, his skills and understanding always brought him before kings; this is the ability of the Holy Spirit our excellent teacher.\n\nAnother quick example is with a young man called Bezaleel. He was filled with the Holy Spirit which resulted in him having wisdom, understanding and knowledge at all levels of Engineering, Architecture, Project management, Construction, Civil works, etc. He obtained every necessary skill required to be a successful contractor to build the Temple of God.\n\nThere is no biblical record of any training institution Bezaleel was enrolled in. All records from the Holy Scriptures indicate that he was anointed of God to build the temple. That anointing was able to teach him what he needed to know concerning his work.\n\nBut the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, **and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things** , and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.\n\n1John 2:27\n\nBezaleel received an intelligent skill in construction, a skill to create magnificent products with gold, silver, brass. He was also very skilful in the cutting and designing of precious to make the temple of the Lord glorious.\n\nThe scripture quantifies his skills as an ability to \" **work in all manner of workmanship** \".\n\nI believe if he lived in current times, he would have been on every head hunter's list for engineers. Which construction or engineering company wouldn't want to have such a man with such enormous ability?\n\nWow, just meditating on this aspect of the teaching ministry of the Spirit of God brings out the importance of the Holy Spirit in the life of every believer. Remember, God called Bazaleel and filled him with the Holy Spirit then all these gifts and abilities begun to manifest in his life; the purpose was to build and glorify the temple of God.\n\nWow! What a gift! What an ability! What an anointing!\n\nSee, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: **And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, to devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.**\n\nExodus 31:2-5\n\nIt gives me much hope and encouragement for every generation; \"with God, all things are possible\". Bezaleel was filled with the Holy Spirit and this Excellent Teacher manifested Himself in 3 unique ways in the life of Bezaleel. These are;\n\n1.The manifestation of wisdom.\n\n2.The manifestation of understanding.\n\n3.The manifestation of knowledge.\n\nWhat a joy to serve a God who has the ability to impart all these gifts and make us a special people outstanding in our field. No wonder Jesus said we are the light of this world. We are like a city set on a hill.\n\nMay the Lord give us deeper insight to engage and know the person of the Holy Spirit; our excellent teacher. Like Apostle Paul, I would also want to know this Holy Spirit and His power.\n\n**That I may know him** , and **the power of his resurrection** , and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;\n\nPhilippians 3:10\n\nThis peculiar gift was specifically for \"building the temple of God\" and nothing else. I believe if he had tried to be a priest or do something else for which he was not anointed for or called to, he would have failed abysmally.\n\nLet's allow this excellent Teacher; the Holy Spirit to teach us, show us and fit us in the perfect will of God, where there is every provision and heavenly grace for the specific calling and work we have to do. Help me Jesus! Help me Lord!\n\nWhen this role of the Holy Spirit; the Excellent Teacher is active in the life of every believer, Christians will have the grace to learn, know and have creative ideas.\n\nBut the **Anointing** ( the Holy Spirit) which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same **Anointing** ( the Holy Spirit) teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.\n\n1 John 2:27\n\n2. Ability to make our memory effective to recollect all things.\n\nBut the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, **and bring all things to your remembrance** , whatsoever I have said unto you.\n\nJohn 14:26\n\nI know not of any physical, medical or psychological procedure which can perform this art to its most effective form; the ability to enhance human memory to effectively recollect \"all things\".\n\nOnce you are a Christian, you need to be filled with the Holy Spirit. He needs to live inside you to assist you in producing excellent results. The Apostle Paul met a group of disciples who though they were saved, they had not received the indwelling Spirit of God.\n\nHe said unto them, have **you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?** And they said unto him, **we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost**. And he said unto them, unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism. Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. **AND WHEN PAUL HAD LAID HIS HANDS UPON THEM, THE HOLY GHOST CAME ON THEM; AND THEY SPAKE WITH TONGUES, AND PROPHESIED**. And all the men were about twelve.\n\nActs 19:2-7\n\nReceiving the Holy Spirit is a MUST for every Christian. When the Spirit of God dwells inside a Christian, that believer is able to manifest His gift and His ability to the world.\n\nThen Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, AND YE SHALL RECEIVE **THE GIFT** OF THE HOLY GHOST.\n\nActs 2:38\n\n3. Ability to give revelations from the word of God.\n\nMany Christians read the Word of God but do not understand or cannot practically relate what they read to their daily lives. This is mostly because of the absence of the Excellent Teacher being the Holy Spirit.\n\nOther ways to gaining deeper understanding of the Word of God is to get a Strong's dictionary and concordance or other Bible resource material that has the original Hebrew and Greek translations. Those of these materials are able to simplify the Biblical language.\n\nDeep spiritual insights are results of meditating on specific scriptures and understanding how it relates to you. Some revelations are just direct instructions or prophecies God is speaking to you about. These are all possible by the presence of the Holy Spirit in the life of a believer.\n\nBut the comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, **WHATSOEVER I HAVE SAID UNTO YOU**.\n\nJohn 14:26\n\nWhat does God, our Heavenly Father want to speak to you about? Has He revealed something to you through His Word or by his servants? Has He spoken to you by His still small voice inside you or has He impressed on your heart to do or know something?\n\nOnce these revelations are confirmed by the scriptures, the Holy Spirit will bring them to your remembrance all the time as you fellowship with Him. The Spirit of Truth is able to bring to life the written Word of God. Hallelujah!\n\n**Consider what I say** (the scriptures); and the Lord (the Holy Spirit) **give thee understanding in all things.**\n\n2Timothy 2:7\nChapter 6\n\n### The Spirit OF MIGHT\n\nAnd the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and MIGHT, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;\n\nIsaiah 11:2\n\nThe word \"might\" from the scripture above is the Hebrew word \"ghebooraw\", which is translated as;\n\n1.Power\n\n2.Strength\n\n3.Force\n\n4.Dominion\n\n5.Boldness\n\n6.Courage\n\nFrom this insight, we understand that the Holy Spirit is also the Spirit who supplies Christians with strength at all levels. The ability to dominate situations, the courage to confront situations, the power to get things done, and the will to overcome obstacles in every area of life is the manifestation of the Spirit of Might in the life of a Christian.\n\nBut thou shalt remember **the LORD thy God** : for it is **he that giveth thee power** (the ability and strength) **to get wealth** that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.\n\nDeuteronomy 8:18\n\nThe ability to generate physical strength in a person was demonstrated fully in the life and ministry of the Prophet Elijah. Though Elijah was then an old man, he was able to outrun the powerful chariot of King Ahab when it began to rain. The scriptures described this happening as an act by the \"hand of God\".\n\nAnd it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not. And it came to pass in the meanwhile, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, **and there was a great rain**. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel. **AND THE HAND OF THE LORD WAS ON ELIJAH** ; AND HE GIRDED UP HIS LOINS, **AND RAN BEFORE AHAB TO THE ENTRANCE OF JEZREEL**.\n\n1Kings 18:44-46\n\nI do not know of any natural man who has been able to outrun a vehicle, especially one that was made for the king being in an excellent condition. It was and is still possible by the Spirit of Might.\n\nFurthermore, in the history of the early church, the Apostles faced great opposition and could not effectively carry out their responsibility of preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ. They had to pray for the manifestation of the Holy Spirit; the Spirit of Might in their ministry.\n\nThe outcome of that prayer meeting was the outpouring of the Spirit of Boldness given to every one of the Apostles to effectively carry out their task.\n\nAnd **when they had prayed** , the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and **they were all filled with the Holy Ghost** , and they spake THE WORD OF GOD **WITH BOLDNESS**.\n\nActs 4:31\n\nBoldness to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ in various ways and through various platforms is the manifestation of the Spirit of Boldness.\n\nNow when they saw **THE BOLDNESS OF PETER AND JOHN** , and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, **they marvelled** ; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.\n\nActs 4:13\n\nThe Spirit of Might can also affect the human body in a very positive way. Strength and life can be given to the body of a Christian by the manifestation of the Spirit of Might.\n\nIn the same way the Holy Spirit raised up Jesus Christ from the grave, so is the Spirit of Might able to quicken and bring life even to the organs of the human body.\n\nBut **if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you** , he that raised up Christ from the dead **SHALL ALSO QUICKEN YOUR MORTAL BODIES** by **HIS SPIRIT THAT DWELLETH IN YOU.**\n\nRomans 8:11\nChapter 7\n\n### The SPIRIT OF GUIDANCE\n\nHowbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, HE WILL GUIDE YOU INTO ALL TRUTH: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.\n\nJohn 16:13\n\nI will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I WILL GUIDE THEE WITH MINE EYE.\n\nPsalm 32:8\n\nAND THE LORD SHALL GUIDE THEE CONTINUALLY, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.\n\nIsaiah 58:11\n\nTo guide is the Hebrew word \"nawkhaw\" which means;\n\n1.To govern.\n\n2.To lead forth.\n\n3.To straighten.\n\n4.To lead.\n\nAnother function of the Holy Spirit in the life of Christians is to \"guide\" every believer. Where is the Holy Spirit guiding Christians to? Where is He leading believers to?\n\nThe guidance that the Holy Spirit is to provide to Christians will lead every Christian to a place of fruitfulness in God. His leadership will guide Christians to a place where believers will be able to fulfil the will and call of God upon their lives. The Holy Spirit will guide Christians to the different places and help believers to go through the different experiences God has for us.\n\nAnd thou shalt remember **all the way which the LORD thy God led thee** these forty years **in the wilderness** , to **humble thee** , and **to prove thee** , to **know what** **was** **in thine heart** , whether **thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no**. And he humbled thee, and **suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know;** **that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every** **word** **that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.**\n\nDeuteronomy 8:2-3\n\n**For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land** , a **land of brooks of water** , **of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills** ; **A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates;** **a land of oil olive, and honey** ; **A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness** , **thou shalt not lack any** **thing** **in it** ; **a land whose stones** **are** **iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.** **When thou hast eaten and art full,** then thou **shalt bless the LORD thy God** **for the good land which he hath given thee.**\n\nDeuteronomy 8:7-10\n\nThen thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, **which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage** ; Who **led thee through that great and terrible wilderness** , **wherein were** **fiery serpents** , **and scorpions** , **and drought, where** **there was** **no water** ; **who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint** ;\n\nDeuteronomy 8:14-15\n\n24 Powerful Manifestations of the Spirit of Guidance\n\nAs the Lord God led and guided the Children of Israel in ancient history through diverse experiences, in a very similar manner is He going to guide and lead every Child of God.\n\nRemember the prophet Malachi described one of the natures of God; the nature of being the same and not changing.\n\nFor I am the LORD, I change not;\n\nMalachi 3:6\n\nIf He purposefully guided the Israelites then, we as Christians now must be rest assured that the Spirit of God will guide and lead us into the same experiences.\n\nNow **all these things happened unto them for our examples** : and **they are written for our admonition (instruction)** , upon whom the ends of the world are come.\n\n1Corinthians 10:11\n\nKindly consider these experiences carefully and allow them to show you how the Spirit of Guidance would lead and guide you as a Christian.\n\n1. He led them for a specific number of years (40 years) to experience the wilderness.\n\nAnd thou shalt remember **all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness**\n\nDeuteronomy 8:2-3\n\n2. He guided them to a place where they would be humbled.\n\n....to **humble thee.**\n\nDeuteronomy 8:2-3\n\n3. He allowed them into certain experiences that would reveal what is really in their heart.\n\n...and **to prove thee** , **to know what** **was** **in thine heart** ,\n\nDeuteronomy 8:2-3\n\n4. He allowed them to go through various trials to see how they would respond each time. He wanted to see if they will resort to the word of God for solutions or ignore the word of God and resort to other things.\n\n... **to prove thee** , to **know what** **was** **in thine heart** , whether **thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.**\n\nDeuteronomy 8:2-3\n\n5. He led them to experience hunger.\n\n...and **suffered thee to hunger**\n\nDeuteronomy 8:2-3\n\n6. He allowed them to eat strange meals at a particular season in their lives.\n\n... **and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know;**\n\nDeuteronomy 8:2-3\n\n7. He disciplined them to the point where they had to gain the knowledge and understand that life and sustenance does not come from what we eat or drink but from the Word of God.\n\n... **.that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every** **word** **that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.**\n\nDeuteronomy 8:2-3\n\n8. He led and guided them into a good land.\n\nFor the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land\n\nDeuteronomy 8:7-10\n\n9. He led them to experience abundance and freshness.\n\n... **a land of brooks of water**\n\nDeuteronomy 8:7-10\n\n10. He led them to experience rare sights and rare opportunities.\n\n... **.a land of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills** ;\n\nDeuteronomy 8:7-10\n\n11. He led them to experience different types of blessings.\n\n... **a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates**\n\nDeuteronomy 8:7-10\n\n12. He led them to a place of different types of anointing's **.**\n\n... **a land of oil olive, and honey**\n\nDeuteronomy 8:7-10\n\n13. He led them into prosperity and into riches.\n\n... **.A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness** ,\n\nDeuteronomy 8:7-10\n\n14. He led them to a place of supernatural abundance and supernatural provision.\n\n... **thou shalt not lack any** **thing** **in it**\n\nDeuteronomy 8:7-10\n\n15. He led them into discovering great economic fortunes and supernatural business ideas.\n\n... **a land whose stones** **are** **iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.**\n\nDeuteronomy 8:7-10\n\n16. He led them to a place of joy and satisfaction.\n\n... **when thou hast eaten and art full,**\n\nDeuteronomy 8:7-10\n\n17. He led them to a place where they blessed the Lord their God.\n\n... **then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God**\n\nDeuteronomy 8:7-10\n\n18. He led them to a place where they possessed the good lands.\n\n... **for the good land which he hath given thee.**\n\nDeuteronomy 8:7-10\n\n19. He led them to escape and be free from bondages and captivity.\n\n... **which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.**\n\nDeuteronomy 8:14-15\n\n20. He led them to experience \"Great\" wilderness and \"Terrible\" wilderness.\n\n... **Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness**\n\nDeuteronomy 8:14-15\n\n21. He led them through places where there were **\"** **fiery serpents\"**.\n\n... **wherein were** **fiery serpents**\n\nDeuteronomy 8:14-15\n\n22. He led them through places where there were **\"scorpions\"**.\n\n... **and scorpions**\n\nDeuteronomy 8:14-15\n\n23. He led them to experience harsh conditions such as drought.\n\n... **and drought, where** **there was** **no water** ;\n\nDeuteronomy 8:14-15\n\n24. He led them to a place of miracles and supernatural provisions.\n\n... **who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint** ;\n\nDeuteronomy 8:14-15\n\nThis is how the Spirit of God intentionally led the children of Israel. We then as Christians ought to be able to discern where the Spirit of God is guiding or leading us to and be willing to obey and follow His leadership.\n\nFor as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.\n\nRomans 8:14\n\nWhen Christians are at cross roads in life, or happen to be in a difficult position to make a very delicate decision, relying on the Spirit of Guidance is the only key to the right way.\n\nAnd **thine ears shall hear a word behind thee** , saying, **this is the way, walk ye in it** , when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.\n\nIsaiah 30:21\n\n7 Practical Ways The Holy Spirit Guides Christians\n\n1. Through the application of various scriptures in the Word of God.\n\nThis book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, **that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein** : for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.\n\nJoshua 1:8\n\n2. Through dreams, visions and trances that can be explained and confirmed from the scriptures.\n\nAnd it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see **visions, and your old men shall dream dreams**.\n\nActs 2:17\n\n3. Through Anointed ministers of God.\n\nAnd they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; **believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.**\n\n2Chronicles 20:20\n\n4. Through wisdom gleaned from real life situations.\n\n**I went** by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down. **Then I saw** , and **considered** **it** **well** : **I looked upon** **it** , and **received instruction**. Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.\n\nProverbs 24:30-34\n\n5. Through the manifestation of the Peace of God in the hearts of believers.\n\nAnd the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, **shall keep your hearts and minds** through Christ Jesus.\n\nPhilippians 4:7\n\n6. Through the inner warning signals the Holy Spirit gives to every believer.\n\nSave that the Holy Ghost **witnesseth** (inner witness) in every city, **saying** that bonds and afflictions abide me.\n\nActs 20:23\n\n7. Through the prophecies given to every believer by the Spirit of God.\n\nThis charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according **to the prophecies which went before on thee** , that **thou by them** (those prophecies) **mightest war a good warfare**.\n\n1Timothy 1:18\nChapter 8\n\nThe SPIRIT OF THE LORD JESUS\n\nThe Holy Spirit functioning as the Spirit of Jesus Christ plays a very important role in the lives of Christians. He is the \"seal\" that authenticates the genuineness of a Christian. The Spirit of Jesus Christ also is the \"patent right\" providing exclusive rights of the ownership of a soul to the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nIn the same way a manufacturer would place a seal of guarantee ensuring the genuineness of a product, so the Holy Spirit described as the Spirit of Christ is the \"seal\" of genuineness on a Christian.\n\nBut ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. **Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his**.\n\nRomans 8:9\n\nNevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, **having this seal** , THE LORD KNOWETH THEM THAT ARE HIS. And, Let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.\n\n2 Timothy 2:19\n\nDo you have the Holy Spirit? Are you truly born-again? Do you have any assurance that you are saved? These and many more questions are some of the reasons why every true believer, MUST be assured of the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit in his or her life.\n\nThe Spirit of Jesus is the \"brand mark\" on Christians; identifying the righteous from the wicked and the sheep from the goats.\n\nAnd before him shall be gathered all nations: **and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth** **his** **sheep from the goats.**\n\nMathew 25:32\nChapter 9\n\nThe SPIRIT OF WISDOM\n\nAnd the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, **The Spirit Of Wisdom**....\n\nIsaiah 11:2\n\nWisdom, I believe is the intelligent and practical application of the required knowledge in any field of endeavour to produce results. Indeed King Solomon, the wisest man ever to live apart from Jesus Christ described wisdom as \"the principal thing\".\n\n**WISDOM** **IS** **THE PRINCIPAL THING** ; therefore get wisdom:\n\nProverbs 4:7\n\nIn the era of our Lord Jesus Christ, wonderful testimonies were given of Him from His own countrymen. Such testimonies were given about Jesus as a result of the level of wisdom that was at work in Him. That level of wisdom produced what was referred to as \" **mighty works** \".\n\nAnd when he was come into **his own country,** he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, whence hath this man **this wisdom** , and **these** **mighty works?**\n\nMathew 13:54\n\nOur Lord Jesus Christ operated at a higher level of wisdom than the wisdom of this world. Obviously that wisdom was clearly from the Holy Spirit living inside Him. There are different types of wisdom from different origins and for the Christian, the scriptures clearly states that we are advantaged to receive the higher kind of wisdom that is supernaturally imparted by the Holy Spirit.\n\nBut the **WISDOM THAT IS FROM ABOVE** is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.\n\nJames 3:17\n\nThe wisdom from above is the higher type of wisdom able to produce excellent results. The Apostle James clearly stated that if any believer lacked the higher type of wisdom; let him ask the Heavenly Father who would give liberally.\n\n**If any of you lack wisdom** , **LET HIM ASK OF GOD** , that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\n\nJames 1:5\n\nThis helps us to understand that every Christian can function at a higher level of wisdom; the wisdom that is able to produce **mighty works**. If you are a Christian and the Spirit of Wisdom is not manifesting in you to the fullest, you need to pray about it and take practical steps.\n\nThe Spirit of Wisdom can fill a person to the fullest or to a particular measure. The results produced by anyone are determined by the measure at which the Spirit of Wisdom is at work in that person. You can be full of the Spirit of Wisdom or you can be empty of the Spirit of Wisdom.\n\nOne of the clearest signs that the Spirit of Wisdom is at work in a person is that the person becomes wise hearted and understands HOW things work and WHY excellent results are achieved.\n\nThe Lord put wisdom and understanding in the hearts of some individuals like Bazaleel and Aholiab which **enabled them to know how to work all manner of work** in building the temple of the Lord.\n\nThen wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, **IN WHOM THE LORD PUT WISDOM AND UNDERSTANDING TO KNOW HOW TO WORK ALL MANNER OF WORK FOR THE SERVICE OF THE SANCTUARY** , according to all that the LORD had commanded.\n\nExodus 36:1\n\nThat same Spirit of Wisdom helped these contractors to follow very detailed instructions the Lord gave concerning the construction of the temple.\n\nWhen the Spirit of Wisdom is functioning at a higher dimension in the life of a Christian, that believer is able to intelligently and practically apply the required knowledge to achieve excellent results anywhere in the world.\n\nWhether it's in church work, business, academia, politics, governance, family and relationships; the Spirit of Wisdom and the Spirit of Understanding always manifests themselves together to help believers in achieving excellent results.\n\nI believe as Christians, we can pray for the manifestation of the Spirit of Wisdom to function in and through us at a very high level in everything we are involved in.\n\nFor it is God (the Spirit of Wisdom) which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.\n\nPhilippians 2:13\n\n7 Ways You Can Receive The Spirit of Wisdom\n\n1.You Can Receive The Spirit Of Wisdom Directly From God.\n\nIf any of you lack wisdom, **let him ask of God, that giveth to all** **men** liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\n\nJames 1:5\n\nAnd all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, **to hear his wisdom that God had put in his heart**.\n\n2 Chronicles 9:23\n\n2.You Can Receive Wisdom And Understanding From The Teachings In The Scriptures.\n\n**He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous** : he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.\n\nProverbs 2:7\n\nHappy is the man that **findeth wisdom** , and the man that getteth understanding.\n\nProverbs 3:13\n\nI have **taught thee in the way of wisdom** ; I have led thee in right paths.\n\nProverbs 4:11\n\n3.You Can Receive Wisdom And Understanding By An Impartation From An Anointed Servant Of God.\n\nFor I long to see you, THAT I MAY **IMPART UNTO YOU** SOME SPIRITUAL GIFT, to the end ye may be established.\n\nRomans 1:11\n\nAnd Joshua the son of Nun WAS FULL OF THE SPIRIT OF WISDOM; for **MOSES HAD LAID HIS HANDS UPON HIM:** and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\nDeuteronomy 34:9\n\n4.You Can Receive Wisdom And Understanding Through Reading.\n\nHappy is the man that **findeth wisdom** , and the man that **getteth understanding**.\n\nProverbs 3:13\n\n5.You Can Receive Wisdom And Understanding Through Learning From The Things You See And Observe.\n\n**I went by the field** of the slothful and by **the vineyard** of the man void of understanding; And, lo, **it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof** , **and the stone wall thereof was broken down**. THEN **I SAW** , AND **CONSIDERED IT WELL** : I **LOOKED UPON IT** , AND **RECEIVED INSTRUCTION**.\n\nProverbs 24:30-32\n\n6.You Can Receive Wisdom And Understanding By Going To Learn The Ways Of Wisdom From A Wise Person.\n\n**Go to the ant** , thou sluggard; **consider her ways** , and be wise: Which **having no guide, overseer, or ruler, provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest**.\n\nProverbs 6:6-8\n\nWho do you consider \" **the ant** \" that you would like to observe and learn from? Your duty is to \" **Go** \", make every effort to go, go in so many ways so as to learn wisdom.\n\n7.You Can Receive Wisdom And Understanding By Hearing The Instructions Of A Father.\n\n**Hear** , ye children, **the instruction of a father** , and attend to know understanding. **For I give you good doctrine** , **forsake ye not my law**. For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. **He taught me also** , and **said unto me** , **Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live**. **Get wisdom, get understanding** : **forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth**. **Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.** **Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.**\n\n**Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her. She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee**. **HEAR, O MY SON, AND RECEIVE MY SAYINGS** ; and the years of thy life shall be many. I have led thee in right paths.\n\nProverbs 4:11\n\n7 Powerful Effects of the Spirit of Wisdom\n\n1.The Spirit of Wisdom produces Intelligence, Skill and Knowledge.\n\nAnd thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted, **whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom,** THAT THEY MAY MAKE AARON'S GARMENTS to consecrate him that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.\n\nExodus 28:3\n\nIt is very interesting to note that the people who were wise hearted were also filled with the Spirit of Wisdom causing them to become intelligent designers of clothes; especially the priestly clothes for Aaron. The anointing of wisdom can make you an intelligent and skilful fashion designer if that is your field.\n\n2.The Spirit of Wisdom produces Creativity and Innovation.\n\nAnd I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they **may make all that I have commanded thee.**\n\nExodus 31:6\n\nWe see from this scripture that whatever God commands, He is also able to provide the necessary skill and the creativity to produce it even if it doesn't exist. Intelligence, creativity, innovation and wonderful ideas are all manifestations of the Spirit of Wisdom in the life of a person.\n\n3.The Spirit of Wisdom causes one to have the Ability to Teach.\n\nAnd Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship; And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work. **AND HE HATH PUT IN HIS HEART THAT HE** **MAY TEACH** , both he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.\n\nExodus 35:30-35\n\nIt is one thing to know something and be able to use that knowledge to produce excellent results. It is also another skill to be able to confer that same knowledge to others in a way that would also cause them to produce those same excellent results.\n\nThe Spirit of Wisdom is able to enhance our ability to confer excellent knowledge and skill to others.\n\n4.The Spirit of Wisdom causes one's heart to be enlarged.\n\nAnd God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much **, and largeness of heart** , even as the sand that is on the sea shore.\n\n1Kings 4:29\n\nTo have a largeness of heart is;\n\n1. To be able to accommodate millions of people.\n\n2.To be able to reach out to millions of people.\n\n3.When your heart is enlarged, you are able to handle more and more.\n\n4.To be able to overcome your limitations of your heart and allow your heart to grow to do and accept more and more.\n\nBecause of the largeness of heart God gave Solomon, he was able to reach out to all the nations of the world, not only his tribe Judah.\n\n**AND THERE CAME OF ALL PEOPLE** to hear the Wisdom of Solomon, **from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom**.\n\n1Kings 4:34\n\n5.The Spirit of Wisdom produces Peace and Soundness of mind.\n\nAnd the LORD **gave Solomon wisdom** , as he promised him: AND **THERE WAS PEACE** BETWEEN HIRAM AND SOLOMON; and they two made a league together.\n\n1Kings 5:12\n\nThe Lord gave Solomon wisdom as He had promised him and that Spirit of Wisdom produced peace among his people and between Solomon and all the kings who would have attacked him and destroyed his kingdom.\n\nKing Solomon knew and acknowledged that through the Spirit of Wisdom, God had given him rest and peace on every-side.\n\nBut now **the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side** , so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.\n\n1 Kings 5:4\n\nThe Spirit of Wisdom can be manifested at a higher level in the life of every Christian if we get to know Him. When the Spirit of Wisdom is demonstrated in the life of a wise husband or wife, that wisdom will cause the person to build a successful home and family.\n\nEvery wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.\n\nProverbs 14:1\n\nIf the Spirit of Wisdom is absent in a person or is functioning at a very low level in a person with a family, that person would tear down his or her marriage with arguments, quarrels, unforgiveness, accusations, and bitterness.\n\nDecide today to be full of the Spirit of Wisdom.\n\n6.The Spirit of Wisdom causes a person to build the house of God.\n\nThen answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; THEREFORE **WE HIS SERVANTS WILL ARISE AND BUILD** : but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.\n\nNehemiah 2:20\n\nAnd I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock **I WILL BUILD MY CHURCH** ; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\n\nMathew 16:18\n\nThe Lord Jesus Christ is building His church and it takes the Spirit of Wisdom functioning in a Christian at a higher level to join in the Lord's vision. The Church is the gathering of the saints; the gathering of people who believe in God through Jesus Christ.\n\nTo build the church is to;\n\n1. Build up, train up and to perfect the individual Christians.\n\n2. Construct the physical buildings where the believers will gather.\n\n... **and unto Him shall the gathering of the people be.**\n\nGenesis 49:10\n\nWhen the believers gather, we are gathered unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. To be actively involved in the building of the Church is to be involved in establishing the Will of God. This demonstrates that the Spirit of Wisdom is at work in you at a very high level.\n\nWherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; **but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.**\n\nMathew 7:20-21\n\n7.The Spirit of Wisdom causes a person to build his own house.\n\nAnd when the queen of Sheba had seen **all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built.**\n\nKings 10:4\n\n**Every wise woman buildeth her house**...\n\nProverbs 14:1\n\nTo be able to build your own house is a clear manifestation of the Spirit of Wisdom functioning at a high level in a life of a person.\n\n**Through wisdom is an house builded** ; and by understanding it is established:\n\nProverbs 24:3\nChapter 10\n\n### The SPIRIT OF KNOWLEDGE\n\nAnd the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, **the Spirit of Knowledge** and of the fear of the LORD.\n\nIsaiah 11:2\n\nKnowledge I believe is;\n\n1.The appropriate information on a subject.\n\n2.The \"know-how\" on how something works or operates.\n\n3.Information acquired to function appropriately.\n\n4.The intelligent understanding of the operations of a particular subject.\n\n5.Educating the mental faculty of a person in a particular discourse.\n\n6.To acquire information on how something works.\n\n7.To become fully acquainted with necessary information.\n\nThus the Spirit of Knowledge enables a Christian to assimilate and understand the information the Word of God provides on every subject in the scriptures. The Apostle Paul in his letter to Timothy his son in the ministry acknowledged that the information provided in the scriptures has the ability to make anybody wise unto salvation.\n\nAnd that from a child thou **HAST KNOWN THE HOLY SCRIPTURES** , **WHICH ARE ABLE TO MAKE THEE WISE UNTO SALVATION** through faith which is in Christ Jesus.\n\n2Timothy 3:15\n\nWithout the presence of the Knowledgeable Teacher, Christians will only read the scriptures just like any ordinary piece of literature. The lack of knowledge of the Word of God also leads to the destruction of the lives of many Christians.\n\n**MY PEOPLE ARE DESTROYED FOR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE** : because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.\n\nHosea 4:6\n\nKnowledge can be received or can be rejected. To know the Word of God is a choice a Christian has to make and a personal decision every serious Christian must take.\n\n5 Benefits of the Spirit of Knowledge\n\n1. The Spirit of Knowledge multiplies the Grace of God upon the life of a Christian.\n\n**Grace** and peace be multiplied unto you **through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord.**\n\n2Peter 1:2\n\n2. The Spirit of Knowledge multiplies the Peace of God upon the life of a Christian.\n\n**Grace** and peace be multiplied unto you **through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord.**\n\n2Peter 1:2\n\n3.The Spirit of Knowledge gives Strength to vision.\n\nAnd such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: **but the people that DO KNOW THEIR GOD SHALL BE STRONG, and do** **exploits** **.**\n\nDaniel 11:32\n\n4.The Spirit of Knowledge Empowers a person to achieve great things.\n\nAnd such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: **but the people that DO KNOW THEIR GOD SHALL be strong, and DO** **EXPLOITS** **.**\n\nDaniel 11:32\n\n5.The Spirit of Knowledge brings deliverance to Christians.\n\nAn hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.\n\nProverbs 11:9\n\n5 Major Things To Know As A Christian\n\n1. A Christian must know the Holy Scriptures; the Word of God.\n\nAnd that **from a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures** , which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.\n\n2Timothy 3:15\n\n2. A Christian must know the Lord God in a very personal way.\n\nAnd such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: **but the people that DO KNOW THEIR GOD** shall be strong, and do exploits.\n\nDaniel 11:32\n\n3. A Christian must know that man does not live by bread alone.\n\nAnd he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; **THAT HE MIGHT MAKE THEE KNOW THAT MAN DOTH NOT LIVE BY BREAD ONLY** , but by **every** **word** **that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD** doth man live.\n\nDeuteronomy 8:3\n\n4. A Christian must know that He has been saved and redeemed unto Good Works.\n\nLet your light so shine before men, **that they may see your good works** , and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\n\nMathew 5:16\n\nFor we are his workmanship, **created in Christ Jesus unto good works** , which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.\n\nEphesians 2:10\n\nCharge them that **are rich in this world** , that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy. That they do good, that **they be rich in good works** , ready to distribute, willing to communicate;\n\n1Timothy 6:17-18\n\n5. A Christian must know and follow the voice of Jesus Christ, the good shepherd.\n\nI am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, **and am known of mine**.\n\nMy **sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:**\n\nJohn 10:14; 27\nChapter 11\n\n### The SPIRIT OF UNDERSTANDING\n\nAnd the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, THE SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND UNDERSTANDING, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;\n\nIsaiah 11:2\n\nTo understand is to;\n\n1.Assimilate knowledge acquired or required.\n\n2.To get meaning from information.\n\n3.To gain deeper insight into what is being said.\n\n4.To gain deeper insight into what is not being said.\n\n5.To practice or obey the logical conclusion of relevant information.\n\nThe Spirit of Understanding has the ability to quicken the way and manner in which we think and understand things.\n\nAnd shall make him of **QUICK UNDERSTANDING** in the fear of the LORD: and he **shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:**\n\nIsaiah 11:3\n\nDifferent people have different levels of understanding. Some are able to understand things immediately; others, understand with time but the Holy Spirit is the one with the power to enhance our ability to understand things.\n\nAchieving great things for the Lord is directly linked to our ability to understand the truth and the will of God for our lives.\n\n...keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and **your understanding** in the sight of the nations, **which shall hear all these statutes** , AND SAY, SURELY THIS **GREAT NATION** IS A WISE AND **UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE.**\n\nDeuteronomy 4:6\n\nUnderstanding can be acquired at different levels and at the different seasons in a person's life.\n\n15 Powerful Effects of the Spirit of Understanding\n\n1. The Spirit of Understanding causes a person to become a Leader and a Ruler.\n\nTake you wise men, and **understanding** , and known among your tribes, **and I will make them rulers over you.**\n\nDeuteronomy 1:13\n\n2. The Spirit of Understanding causes a person to be wise and distinguished.\n\nBehold, I have done according to thy words: lo, **I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart** ; **so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.**\n\n1Kings 3:12\n\n3. The Spirit of Understanding gives a person a large heart to minister to many people.\n\nAnd God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.\n\n1Kings 4:29\n\n**And there came of all people to hear** the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.\n\n1Kings 4:34\n\n4. The Spirit of Understanding gives direction.\n\nAnd of the children of Issachar, **which were men** **that had understanding of the times** , **TO KNOW WHAT ISRAEL OUGHT TO DO** ; the heads of them were two hundred; and **all their brethren** **were** **at their commandment**.\n\n1 Chronicles 12:32\n\n5. The Spirit of Understanding puts a person in-charge of affairs.\n\nOnly the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, **AND GIVE THEE CHARGE CONCERNING ISRAEL,** that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God.\n\n1Chronicles 22:12\n\n6. The Spirit of Understanding produces prosperity.\n\nAnd he sought God in the days of Zechariah, **who had understanding in the visions of God:** and as long as he sought the LORD, **God made him to prosper**.\n\n2Chronicles 26:5\n\n7. The Spirit of Understanding breaches every inferiority gap between the great and small.\n\n**But I have understanding as well as you** ; **I** **am** **not inferior to you** : yea, who knoweth not such things as these?\n\nJob 12:3\n\n8.The lack of the Spirit of Understanding leads to demotion and poverty.\n\nFor **thou hast hid their heart from understanding** : therefore shalt **thou not exalt** **them**.\n\nJob 17:4\n\n9. The Holy Spirit living inside a Christian brings understanding.\n\nBut there is a spirit in man: and **the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding**.\n\nJob 32:8\n\n10. Through the Spirit of Understanding, a Christian can walk in obedience.\n\n**Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with** **my** **whole heart.**\n\nPsalm 119:34\n\n11. The Spirit of Understanding comes through effective meditation of the Word of God.\n\n**I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies** **are** **my meditations**.\n\nPsalm 119:99\n\n12. The lack of the Spirit of Understanding leads to the destruction of the soul of a person.\n\nBut whoso committeth adultery with a woman **lacketh understanding** : he that doeth it **destroyeth his own soul**.\n\nProverbs 6:32\n\n13. The Spirit of Understanding gives favour.\n\n**Good understanding giveth favour** : but the way of transgressors is hard.\n\nProverbs 13:15\n\n14. A person with Great Understanding will be slow to anger.\n\nHe that is slow to wrath is of **great understanding** : but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.\n\nProverbs 14:29\n\n15. The Spirit of Understanding is a well of life.\n\n**Understanding** **is** **a wellspring of life** unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly.\n\nProverbs 16:22\nChapter 12\n\n### The QUICKENING SPIRIT\n\nIt is interesting to note that the Holy Spirit is also the Life Quickening Spirit. God who created man has the ability to repair, replace, remould and reconstruct the human body or any part of the organs of the human body by His Spirit who dwells in every Christian.\n\nBut if **the Spirit** of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead **shall also quicken** your mortal bodies **by his spirit that dwelleth in you**.\n\nRomans 8:11\n\nThe word \"to quicken\" is the Greek word \"zoopoieo\" which is literally translated as;\n\n1.To vitalize.\n\n2.To revitalize.\n\n3.To make alive.\n\n4.To give life.\n\n5.To quicken.\n\n6.To give energy.\n\n7.To supply consistent energy.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the Quickening Spirit. The next question then is \"what or who does He quicken?\"\n\n3 Powerful Effects of the Quickening Spirit\n\n1.The Holy Spirit gives life to the dead soul of a person; making the person alive unto God. This is what is referred to as being saved or being born again.\n\nBut God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when **we were dead in sins** , hath **quickened us together with Christ, by grace ye are saved**.\n\nEphesians 2:4-5\n\n2.The Holy Spirit is able to influence the soul of a person to bring about positive transformation.\n\nThe law of the LORD is perfect, **converting the soul** : the testimony of the LORD is sure, **making wise the simple**.\n\nPsalm 19:7\n\nHe **restoreth my soul** : he **leadeth me in the paths of righteousness** for his name's sake.\n\nPsalm 23:3\n\n3. The Holy Spirit sanctifies the body of a Christian to make it a living sanctuary.\n\nWhat? know ye not that **your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost** **which is in you** , which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?\n\n1Corinthians 6:19\nChapter 13\n\n### The SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION\n\nThat the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you The SPIRIT of WISDOM AND REVELATION in the knowledge of him:\n\nEphesians 1:17\n\nDeeper understanding, deeper insights and deeper revelations from the word of God doesn't come to any believer by chance but by the sweet influences of the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation.\n\nI believe this is one of the most important roles the Holy Spirit plays in the life and ministry of every Christian. After an individual is born-again, the next thing the Christian must do is to gain an adequate knowledge and understanding of the reality of being-born again; what it really means and how to live the life of a new creation.\n\nUnderstanding the significance of the \"new birth\" and how to grow in the Christian faith is by far the most important knowledge for a Christian to acquire after salvation. Christians at all levels of spirituality would have to have a deeper connection, a deeper fellowship, and deeper relationship with the Holy Spirit in order to understand the deeper revelations from the Word of God.\n\nDEEP CALLETH UNTO DEEP at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.\n\nPsalm 42:7\n\nThe absence of the Spirit of Revelation in the life of a believer results in the lack of deeper insight, a low level of spiritual understanding of the Word of God and shallowness in spirituality as a Christian. From today, decide to have a deeper fellowship with the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation.\n\nMany Christians are living their lives in darkness, not knowing who they are in Christ Jesus or the instructions God has given to believers through His word. Others are totally ignorant of the provisions and the inheritance God has given through his word.\n\nThe Holy Scriptures is a reflection; a mirror of who we are as Christians, who we ought to be as believers and how God sees Christians through Jesus Christ. In this regard, anytime I read the scriptures, I understand who I am, what the Heavenly Father is saying to me, what to do in the different aspects of my life and how to put into practice the wisdom taught by the Holy Spirit of God.\n\nBut whoso **looketh into** the perfect law of liberty, and **continueth therein** , he being **not a forgetful hearer,** but **a doer of the work** , this man shall **be blessed in his deed**.\n\nJames 1:25\n\nPsalm 82 for an example, gives us a vivid description of how God sees his children and the effect the absence of revelation has on the children of God.\n\nGod standeth in the congregation of the MIGHTY; he judgeth among the gods How long will ye JUDGE unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah. DEFEND the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy. DELIVER the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked. THEY KNOW NOT, NEITHER WILL THEY UNDERSTAND; THEY WALK ON IN DARKNESS: ALL THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE EARTH ARE OUT OF COURSE. I HAVE SAID, YE ARE god's; AND ALL OF YOU ARE CHILDREN OF THE MOST HIGH. BUT YE SHALL DIE LIKE MEN, AND FALL LIKE ONE OF THE PRINCES. Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.\n\nPsalm 82:1-8 KJV\n\n14 Revelations From Psalm 82\n\n1.God calls the believers MIGHTY.\n\n2.God calls the believers who are his children \"gods\".\n\n3.God sees the believers as JUDGES.\n\n4.God sees his children as people who are DEFENDERS.\n\n5.God calls his children DELIVERERS of the poor and fatherless.\n\n6.For lack of knowledge of who they are, God see his children as IGNORANT.\n\n7.For lack of revelation, the children of God will LACK UNDERSTANDING.\n\n8.For lack of revelation of how God sees us, his children WALK IN DARKNESS.\n\n9.Because the children of God walk in darkness, all the things that are foundations of economies are not the true foundations; because those who can bring about the real foundations are walking in darkness.\n\n10.What most people believe and build their lives on are lies and the false foundations of this world. Why is this so? The children of God are walking in IGNORANCE AND in DARKNESS.\n\n11.The Lord reminds us again and again of who we are; that WE ARE gods.\n\n12.He tells us \"ALL OF YOU ARE CHILDREN OF THE MOST HIGH.\n\n13.For lack of revelation and understanding of who we are, His word tells us of a sad reality BUT YE SHALL DIE LIKE MEN, AND FALL LIKE ONE OF THE PRINCES.\n\n14.Children of God end up like ordinary unbelievers and perish although great; they perish like one of the princes of this world.\nChapter 14\n\n### The SPIRIT OF COUNSEL\n\nAnd the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, THE SPIRIT OF COUNSEL AND MIGHT, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;\n\nIsaiah 11:2\n\nThe Holy Spirit who is also called the Spirit of Counsel can be described as the;\n\n1.The Spirit of Prudence.\n\n2.The Spirit of Advice.\n\n3.The Spirit of Planning.\n\n4.The Spirit of Purpose.\n\n10 Powerful Effects of the Spirit of Counsel\n\n1.The Spirit of Counsel brings Establishment.\n\nThe counsel of the LORD **standeth for ever** , the thoughts of his heart **to all generations.**\n\nPsalm 33:11\n\nWithout counsel purposes are disappointed: but in **the multitude of counsellors they are established.**\n\nProverbs 15:22\n\n2. The Spirit of Counsel fosters unity.\n\n**We took sweet counsel together** , and walked unto the house of God **as a company.**\n\nPsalm 55:14\n\n3. The Spirit of Counsel brings guidance and direction to the life and ministry of a believer.\n\n**Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel** , and afterward receive me to glory.\n\nPsalm 73:24\n\n4. The Spirit of Counsel brings to remembrance the works of God.\n\nThey soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel\n\nPsalm 106:13\n\n5. The Spirit of Counsel brings sound wisdom which leads to understanding which leads to strength in all areas of life.\n\nCounsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.\n\nProverbs 8:14\n\n6. The Spirit of Counsel brings safety.\n\n**Where no counsel is, the people fall** : but in the **multitude of counsellors there is safety.**\n\nProverbs 11:14\n\n7. The Spirit of Counsel makes a person wise.\n\nThe way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but **he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise**.\n\nProverbs 12:15\n\n8. The Spirit of Counsel makes you wise in your latter end.\n\nHear counsel, and receive instruction, **that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.**\n\nProverbs 19:20\n\n9. The Spirit of Counsel makes you a man of understanding.\n\nCounsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.\n\nProverbs 20:5\n\n10. The Spirit of Counsel brings purpose to the life and ministry of a Christian.\n\nEvery **purpose is established by counsel** : and with good advice make war.\n\nProverbs 20:18\n\nFor by **wise counsel thou shalt make thy war** : and in multitude of counsellors there is safety.\n\nProverbs 24:6\nChapter 15\n\n### The LORD OF THE HARVEST\n\nThen saith he unto his disciples, the **harvest** truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; Pray ye therefore the LORD OF THE HARVEST, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.\n\nMatthew 9:37-38\n\nWhat is the harvest Jesus Christ is talking about? The harvest can be described as;\n\n1.The souls of men ready to be saved.\n\n2.The number of people willing to hear the gospel of Jesus Christ and repent.\n\n3.Those ready to be redeemed unto God through Christ Jesus.\n\n4.People ready to be translated from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God.\n\n5.The number of people who will be saved once they hear the gospel of salvation.\n\nFrom the Holy Scriptures we understand that there are three types of harvesters involved in the gathering of the souls of men into the Kingdom of God.\n\n1.The Holy Spirit; the Lord of the harvest.\n\nTherefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the **Lord of the harvest** , that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.\n\nLuke 10:2\n\n2.The Servants and Ministers of God.\n\nFor **we are labourers together with God** : ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.\n\n1Corinthians 3:9\n\n3. The Reaper Angels of God.\n\nThe enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.\n\nMathew 13:39\n\nThe souls of men are ready everywhere in the world to be harvested into the Kingdom of God. Comparing the harvest at hand and the number of men and women willing, available or ready to gather the souls is totally mediocre. This is why every Christian must understand and employ the three ministries of the Lord of the Harvest.\n\n3 Ministries of the Lord of the Harvest\n\n1.The Ekballo Ministry of the Holy Spirit.\n\n2.The Helko Ministry of the Holy Spirit.\n\n3.The Elegcho Ministry of the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe Ekballo Ministry of the Holy Spirit\n\nThen saith he unto his disciples, the harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will **SEND FORTH** labourers into his harvest.\n\nMatthew 9:37-38\n\nOur Lord Jesus Christ clearly pointed out that the solution to increasing the number of labourers in the harvesting of the souls of men is \"to pray\" that the Lord of the Harvest will \"send forth\" labourers to go into the field to reap the harvest.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the phrase \"to send forth\" is the Greek word \"ekballo\" which is translated as;\n\n1.To produce.\n\n2.To bring forth.\n\n3.To cast forth.\n\n4.To cast out.\n\n5.To drive out.\n\n6.To expel.\n\n7.To pluck out.\n\n8.To pull out.\n\n9.To take out.\n\n10.To thrust out.\n\n11.To send away.\n\n12.To send out.\n\nUpon meditating on this wonderful revelation, we understand that the word \"ekballo\" denotes a forceful sending forth of people to go in to reap the harvest. As long as the Christian prays and intercedes for the harvest of souls of men, God our Heavenly Father is able to produce and send forth labourers through the ministry of the LORD OF THE HARVEST to harvest the ripped souls of men.\n\nAs the Christian spends time to pray, the Lord of the Harvest gets busy with the ekballo ministry; sending forth masses of labourers all over the world to go into the different fields of the world to reap the harvest of souls for the Kingdom of God.\n\nThe Helko Ministry of the Holy Spirit\n\nNo man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me **DRAW him** : and I will raise him up at the last day.\n\nJohn 6:44\n\nThis is one of the most effective ways of reaping the harvest of Souls into the Kingdom of God; the \"drawings \"of the Holy Spirit. The word \"to draw\" is the Greek word \"helko\" which is translated as;\n\n1.To drag.\n\n2.To bring close.\n\n3.To cause to come near.\n\n4.To specially select something or someone.\n\nOur Lord Jesus Christ made a profound statement that in John 6:44. Understanding the words of that statement brings every Christian into 4 revealing conclusions.\n\n**No man can come to me** , except **the Father which hath sent me** **DRAW him** : and I will raise him up at the last day.\n\nJohn 6:44\n\n1.No one can come to Jesus on his or her own accord.\n\n2.No one can be saved except through the mercy of the Heavenly Father.\n\n3. The Heavenly Father is actively involved in the harvesting of the souls of men.\n\n4.No one can be raised unto eternal life expect by the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nOften when you find yourself loving the ministry of a particular servant of God or being drawn to the teaching ministry of a particular pastor, it is a sign that Helko ministry of the Holy Spirit is at work on you.\n\nSecondly, when you are spiritually born into a specific church, it's one of the clearest signs that God has drawn you to that ministry.\n\nAnd thirdly, the Lord of the Harvest may personally impress on your heart to follow or serve a specific man of God. These are all the results of the \"drawing\" ministry of the Holy Spirit.\n\nSometimes, some people are just led into the church by no invitation flyer or any form of advertisement but solely by the ministry of The Lord of the Harvest. He wins and directs souls into the Kingdom of God.\n\nYou might have felt a very strong attraction to a particular ministry or have a very strong preference to listening to the teaching ministry of a particular servant of God, it might be a way the Holy Spirit is possibly leading you follow closely that servant of God so as to catch an anointing or be trained for the work of the ministry.\n\nThe Elegcho Ministry of the Holy Spirit\n\nAnd he, when he is come, will **CONVICT** the world in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgement:\n\nJohn 16:8\n\nNow when they heard this, they were **PRICKED IN THEIR HEART** , and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, **men and brethren, what shall we do**?\n\nActs 2:37\n\nThis is also the work of the Holy Spirit; to \"convict\" the world. This is what we call the **Convicting Ministry** of the Holy Spirit. Remember the scriptures imply that the tools of a Christian are not visible tools but are mighty weapons and effective tools through the Holy Spirit.\n\nFor the **weapons of our warfare** **are** **not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;**\n\n2 Corinthians 10:4\n\nThe word \"to convict\" is the Greek word \"elegcho\" which is translated as;\n\n1.To reprove.\n\n2.To confute.\n\n3.To admonish.\n\n4.To convince.\n\n5.To tell a fault.\n\n6.To rebuke.\n\n7.To bring to judgement.\n\nMany Christians don't confess their sins anymore, most see and portray themselves as \"righteous\", \"honest\" and the \"goodie goodies\" of our societies in comparism to others.\n\nA lot more people who seem to possess many good and excellent attributes in this life see no need for salvation because to them, they are ok, to them they are good, and to them they do not harm or inflict pain on others.\n\nBut as the scriptures explicitly states, we are \"NOT SAVED\" by any works of \"RIGHTEOUSNESS. No matter how \"clean\" we are in our own eyes or may be to in the sight of the world, we might not be so in the sight of God; whose opinion matters most.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why the grace for everyone to be saved has been given to all.\n\nFor **BY GRACE ARE YE SAVED** through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: **NOT OF WORKS, lest any man should boast.**\n\nEphesians 2:8-9\n\nFor the grace of God that bringeth salvation **hath appeared to all men** ,\n\nTitus 2:11\n\nIt is only the Holy Spirit who can really convict someone. He is the only one who is able to show man his true nature and the urgent need for salvation through Jesus Christ our Lord. Preachers may preach, authors may write books, evangelists may hold crusades and have evangelistic programs but none of these would yield any results without the convicting ministry of the Holy Spirit.\n\nAnother dimension of the convicting ministry of the Holy Spirit in demonstrated in the Acts of the Apostles. It is what I refer to as convicting by pricking the hearts of men and women.\n\nIt was only after Simon Peter had received the anointing of the Holy Spirit that he was able to stand out from the crowds to preach to the entire city in so much that those present where pricked in their heart to see their need for salvation.\n\nNow when they heard this, they were **pricked in their heart** , and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, **Men** **and** **brethren, what shall we do?**\n\nActs 2:37\n\nThese were the same hardened people who condoned to the murder of Jesus Christ and were now being convicted by the Holy Spirit. They were now ready to receive the same Jesus whom they crucified as their Saviour. This is a vivid example of the convicting ministry of the Holy Spirit.\n\nWe need this convicting ministry of the Holy Spirit to be more effective in these last days because the hearts of many are hardened and have waxed cold to God.\n\nBut evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.\n\n2 Timothy 3:13\n\nThis know also, **that in the last days perilous times shall come**. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.\n\n2 Timothy 3:1-5\n\nThis is one of the reasons why the \"elegcho\" ministry of the Holy Spirit must be effective in our sermons, teachings, radio broadcasts, and any other evangelistic or outreach ministry we engage in to reap in the harvest of souls into the Kingdom of God.\nChapter 16\n\n### The SPIRIT ABLE TO KEEP CHRISTIANS FROM BACKSLIDING\n\nNow unto him that is able to KEEP YOU FROM FALLING, and to PRESENT YOU FAULTLESS before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.\n\nJude 1:24-25\n\nThe Holy Spirit has the ability to play two significant roles in the life and ministry of every Christian.\n\n1. To assist Christians to be steadfast; to stay on course.\n\nTherefore, my beloved brethren, **BE YE STEDFAST** , **UNMOVEABLE** , always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.\n\n1Corinthians 15:58\n\n2. Present Christians faultless before the presence of God our Heavenly Father.\n\nNow unto him that is able to **KEEP YOU FROM FALLING** , and to **PRESENT YOU FAULTLESS** before the presence of his glory....\n\nJude 1:24-25\n\nIn reference to the scripture above, the phrase \"to keep\" is the Greek word \"phulasso\" also translated as;\n\n1.To watch.\n\n2.Be on guard.\n\n3.To preserve.\n\n4.To observe.\n\n5.To save.\n\nIn effect, the Holy Spirit also acts as A PRESERVATIVE in the life of every believer; He is the one who is able to keep believers from backsliding as we remain obedient to Him. As long as Christians constantly nurture our relationship with the Holy Spirit, our fellowship with God is preserved.\n\nThe grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the COMMUNION OF THE HOLY GHOST, be with you all. Amen\n\n2 Corinthians 13:14\n\nThe word \"communion\" is the Greek word \"koinonia\" which is translated as;\n\n1.Partnership.\n\n2.Participation.\n\n3.Contribution.\n\n4.Fellowship.\n\n5.Interaction.\n\nSecondly, the Holy Spirit is to present believers faultless before our Heavenly Father. How is He going to accomplish this assignment? As our care-taker, the Holy Spirit also plays the important role of a parent or a guardian to every Christian while we are alive here on earth.\n\nBut the Comforter, **which is the Holy Ghost** , whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\n\nJohn 14:26\n\nRemember as the scripture clearly says;\n\nFor **we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ** ; that **every one may receive the things** **done** **in** **his** **body,** according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.\n\n2Corinthians 5:10\n\nOn that day when all Christians appear before that judgment seat of Christ, how much we have allowed the Holy Spirit to influence us unto good works would be evident to all.\n\nMany who have rejected the Holy Spirit and fellowship with Him have actually rejected their \"care taker\", and the \"parent\" with whom the Lord Jesus Christ left us with to help every Christian to live a life pleasing unto God.\n\nA best scenario is a father who has the care take of his daughter from her birth through to her college years to her graduation and to her first job ultimately looking forward to presenting her \"blameless and faultless\" to her husband on her wedding day. How glorious!!\n\nNow, in the same way many daughters may have become rebellious to their parents, so have many Christians rejected the Holy Spirit and have become very rebellious to the Spirit of God hence many have fallen by the wayside.\n\nA sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, **some fell by the way side** ; **AND IT WAS TRODDEN DOWN, AND THE FOWLS OF THE AIR DEVOURED IT.**\n\nLuke 8:5\nChapter 17\n\n### The SPIRIT OF POWER\n\nJesus answered and said unto them, **Ye do err** , not knowing the scriptures **, nor the POWER OF GOD.**\n\nMatthew 22:29\n\nA clear understanding of this scripture gives us two clear reasons why people go into error or take the wrong decisions in life.\n\n1.Lack of knowledge of the Holy Scriptures.\n\n2.Ignorance of the Power of God; the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the Power of God. He is the one who demonstrates and manifests the power of God through-out the entire universe. He is the power that is able to change a person completely or positively influence a Christian to walk in the newness of life.\n\nIf you are struggling with any addiction, evil habits, not knowing what to do or where to go in your life and ministry, allow the power of God to influence you and show you the right way.\n\nAnd **thine ears shall HEAR A WORD behind thee** , saying, **This** **is** **the way, walk ye in it** , when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.\n\nIsaiah 30:21\n\nIn Luke 1:35, The Angel of the Lord informed Mary that the Power of the Highest being the Holy Spirit would overshadow her and cause her to be pregnant and give birth to Jesus Christ the messiah. The power of God makes impossible things possible!\n\nAnd the angel answered and said unto her, **The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee** , and the **POWER OF THE HIGHEST shall overshadow thee** : therefore also **that holy thing which shall be born of thee** shall **be called the Son of God**.\n\nLuke 1:35\n\nIn Luke chapter 5:17, the Power of God was manifested while Jesus Christ was teaching at a conference bringing HEALING to all that were present at the service. Like I stated before, the Holy Spirit is the power of God who is ready to manifest the will of God anywhere.\n\nAnd it came to pass on **a certain day** , as **he was teaching** , that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law **sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem:** and **THE POWER OF THE LORD WAS PRESENT TO HEAL THEM.**\n\nLuke 5:17\n\nFurther on, in Luke chapter 9: 43, the Holy Spirit is described as the Mighty Power of God who brought amazing miracles to the meeting that was organised.\n\n**And they were all amazed at the MIGHTY POWER of God**. But while they wondered everyone at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,\n\nLuke 9:43\n\nThis same Holy Spirit has the power to transform an unbelieving person into a new creation.\n\nBut **AS MANY AS RECEIVED HIM** , to **them gave he power to become the sons of God,** **even** **to them that believe on his name:**\n\nJohn 1:12\n\nFor a Christian the ability to become a faithful witness is by the power of the Holy Spirit. How does one receive such a power?\n\nBut ye shall **receive POWER** , **after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you** : and **ye shall be witnesses unto me** both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.\n\nActs 1:8\n\nHow does the Holy Spirit come upon a person?\n\n7 Practical Ways To Receive The Holy Spirit\n\n1. Through hearing the preaching of the Word of God.\n\nWhile **Peter yet spake these words** , the **Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.**\n\nActs 10:44\n\nAnd the **spirit entered into me when he spake unto me,** and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.\n\nEzekiel 2:2\n\n2. Through spending time in Prayer.\n\nAnd **when they had PRAYED** , the place was shaken where they were assembled together; **and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost** , and they spake the word of God with boldness.\n\nActs 4:31\n\n3. Through the Laying on of the hands of an Anointed Servants of God.\n\nAnd **when PAUL HAD LAID** **HIS** **HANDS UPON THEM, the Holy Ghost came on them** ; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.\n\nActs 19:6\n\n4. Through the communication of the word of God.\n\nAnd be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but **be filled with the Spirit** ; **Speaking to yourselves in psalms** and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;\n\nEphesians 5:18-19\n\n5. Through listening to and singing Spiritual Songs and Hymns.\n\nAnd be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but **be filled with the Spirit** ; Speaking to yourselves in psalms and **hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making** melody in your heart to the Lord;\n\nEphesians 5:18-19\n\n6. Through the impartation of an Anointed servant of God.\n\nThen said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. And when he had said this, **he breathed on** **them** **, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost** :\n\nJohn 20:21-22\n\n7. By asking the Heavenly Father for the Holy Spirit.\n\nIf ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children **: how much more shall** **your** **heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?**\n\nLuke 11:13\n\nIn Acts 10:38, our Lord Jesus Christ begun to do specific things after He was anointed with the Holy Spirit and with the Power of God. It is only the presence and the power of the Holy Spirit amplified in the life of the believer that would enable the Christian to do certain \"good works\".\n\nHow God anointed Jesus of Nazareth **with the Holy Ghost and WITH POWER** : who went about **doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil** ; for God was with him.\n\nActs 10:38\n\nDo you want the power of God to be at work in your life as He worked in the life of Jesus Christ? Do you want to change or break away from a particular habit? The answer is the power of God at work in your life.\n\nFor it is **God (the power of the Holy Spirit)** which **worketh in you** both **to will and to do** of his good pleasure.\n\nPhilippians 2:13\nChapter 18\n\n### The RESURRECTION POWER OF GOD\n\nThat I may know him, and the **POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION** , and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death.\n\nPhilippians 3:10\n\nIt was Apostle Paul's great desire to get to know the Holy Spirit who is also the Resurrection Power of God. Remember, our Lord Jesus Christ was crucified, he died and was buried just like everyone else; he descended into the lower parts of the earth (hell).\n\nWherefore he saith, when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. Now that he ascended, what is it but that **he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth**? **He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things**.\n\nEphesians 4:8-10\n\nThere is a brief description as to what happened when Jesus Christ was in Hell. Our Lord Jesus Christ defeated Satan and the hordes of Hell who also had the ability to keep the souls of men unto everlasting condemnation.\n\nAnd having **spoiled principalities and powers** , he made **a shew of them openly** , **TRIUMPHING OVER THEM** in it.\n\nColossians 2:15\n\nInterpreting the scriptures reveals that there was an open contest between Jesus Christ and Satan who had with him his entourage and hordes of Hell. This contest was to determine who should have the power and the authority over Death and Hell.\n\nPraise be unto God, our Lord Jesus Christ overcame not only Satan but all the demons and hordes of Hell TRIUMPHING over them in victory. After the contest was over and Jesus had triumphed over Satan, our Lord Jesus took the power and the dominion that Satan had over the human race from the fall of Adam in the Garden of Eden; the ability to put the men to death and their souls into Hell (keys of death and Hell).\n\n**I am he that liveth, and was dead** ; and, behold, **I am alive for evermore** , Amen; and have the KEYS OF HELL AND OF DEATH.\n\nRevelations 1:18\n\nFrom the scriptures, we know who Jesus is and we understand what our Lord Jesus Christ did to have such power and authority in His name. The authority and the power conferred on the name of Jesus Christ is able to bring to subjection everything and anyone in Heaven, on Earth and down in Hell.\n\nThat at the name of Jesus **every knee should bow** , **of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;**\n\nPhilippians 2:10\n\nThe Holy Spirit is also manifested as the Power who brought Jesus Christ back to life after His victorious contest in Hell. The resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead certified that He is the Son of God with the Power and Dominion that Satan previously had.\n\nAnd **declared to be the Son of God with power** , according to the Spirit of Holiness, **by the resurrection from the dead** :\n\nRomans 1:4\n\nBecause our Lord Jesus Christ did not and could not perish in Hell, all who believe in Him and in Salvation through His name are promised to be made alive and resurrected from the dead unto eternal life.\n\n......that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\n\nJohn 3:16\n\nAnd if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.\n\nThen they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.\n\nIf in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.\n\nBut now is Christ risen from the dead, and **become the firstfruits of them that slept**.\n\nFor since by man came death, **by man came also the resurrection of the dead.**\n\nFor as in Adam all die, **even so in Christ shall all be made alive**.\n\n1 Corinthians 15:17-22\n\nIf our Lord Jesus Christ died, went to Hell, and was the first to overcome Death and Hell to walk into eternal life victorious then we who believe in Him will follow him in the same pattern.\n\nJesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: **he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.**\n\nJohn 11:25\n\nThis is the reason why the gospel of salvation must be preached and sung to everyone; everyone must be given the opportunity to believe in Jesus Christ.\n\nAndre Crouch the song writer rightly stated in his famous song;\n\nJesus is the answer for the world today, above his there's no other, Jesus is the way, Jesus is the answer for the world today, above his there's no other, Jesus is the way!\n\nWithout trust, faith, belief and a total commitment to the salvation that is in the Lord Jesus Christ, all the human race are doomed to Hell no matter how good a person may be.\nChapter 19\n\n### The INDWELLING SPIRIT\n\nIs it possible for the Spirit of God to dwell inside a person? Remember, spirits are without human bodies and can occupy, control and make the human body a home and dwelling place with or without invitation.\n\nThe reality is that you can have several spirits living concurrently with you in your body and you may not even be aware of it. You may not be the only resident living inside your body; there may be other spirit tenants or spirit visitors whom you may have accepted as friends living with you in your body. You must be aware of this reality.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is also able to occupy a person in portions of fullness. Jesus was described as being FULL of the Holy Spirit.\n\nAnd Jesus being **FULL OF THE HOLY GHOST** returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,\n\nLuke 4:1\n\nDo you have the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit inside you? The Holy Spirit can live inside every Christian; He is also called \"the indwelling Spirit\". He fills in different measures to which He is allowed.\n\nEven the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: **but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, AND SHALL BE IN YOU.**\n\nJohn 14:17\n\nA Christian who has allowed the Holy Spirit to fill him and live inside him is therefore able to exhibits certain characteristics. These same characteristics show the fullness level of the Holy Spirit in the life of a person.\n\n14 Practical Manifestations of The Indwelling Spirit\n\nBut the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,\n\nMeekness, temperance: against such there is no law.\n\nAnd they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.\n\nLet us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.\n\nGalatians 5:22-26\n\nWhen the Holy Spirit merges with your human spirit, He makes your spirit alive unto God; hence you become born-again. The fruit of this relationship between the spirit of a person and the Indwelling Spirit of God is;\n\n1. The ability to love and be loved\n\n2. The ability to be joyful despite contrary evidence\n\n3. The tenacity to endure or suffer long\n\n4. The ability to demonstrate gentleness\n\n5. The ability to be good to all men\n\n6. The ability to demonstrate faith in God and in His Word\n\n7. The ability to walk in meekness\n\n8. The grace to be tolerant and temperate\n\n9. The grace to control your flesh\n\n10. The grace to control your desires and affections\n\n11. The grace to crucify worldly lusts and worldly pursuits\n\n12. The ability to walk in humility and not to desire vain glory\n\n13. The wisdom not to provoke other Christians to sin\n\n14. The grace to walk in love and not envy\n\nIf you are truly born- again, you need to be conscious of the Indwelling Spirit of God living inside you. How can you tell or what are the signs that the Holy Spirit is living inside you and no other evil spirits.\n\nFirstly, you must be able to produce the fruits stated above. Secondly, the Indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit teaches and corrects every child of God. It's like you have an intuitive teacher and a guardian.\n\nBut the **anointing** ( the Holy Spirit) which ye have received of him **ABIDETH IN YOU** , and ye need not that any man teach you: but as **the same anointing teacheth you of all things** , and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.\n\n1 John 2:27\n\nTo some Christians the Indwelling Spirit of God has been silenced through disobedience and hardness of heart.\n\nWherefore as the Holy Ghost saith, Today if ye **will hear his voice, Harden not your hearts,** as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:\n\nHebrews 3:7 -8\n\nTo other Christians, they are not even aware of His presence inside them and therefore don't give Him the pre-eminence. This is why the Apostle John had to reassure believers that there is a greater one living inside every Christian.\n\n**Ye are of God** , little children, and have overcome them: **because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.**\n\n1John 4:4\n\nAnother batch of Christians only see the Holy Spirit is an influence or something that comes at special times and therefore ignore His voice or promptings within them every time He tries to instruct, correct or direct.\n\n**My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge**......\n\nHosea 4:6\n\nRemember, the Holy Spirit is your greatest partner as a Christian and you must learn to acknowledge Him as such.\nChapter 20\n\n### The SPIRIT OF LIFE\n\nThe Holy Spirit who is also called the Spirit of Life is the breath of God. He is the administrator of the presence of God and carries out the instructions and commandments of God the Father.\n\nWe read in the history of creation that any instruction given by God the Father to create something, as long as it was an instruction from God the Father, the Spirit of Life gave life and being to the words spoken by God the Father.\n\n**And God said** , Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. **And the earth brought forth grass,** **and** **herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed** **was** **in itself, after his kind:** and God saw that it was good.\n\nGenesis 1:11- 12\n\nWe ought to ask ourselves, who was the one carrying out the instructions that were being given by God the Father at the beginning of creation? It was the Holy Spirit; the Spirit of Life. Why do I say so?\n\nAnd the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. **And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters**. And **God said, Let there be light: and there was light.**\n\nGenesis 1:2-3\n\nIt was the Spirit of God moving upon the emptiness, the void and the darkness which was upon the face of the deep. As soon as the Father gave out the instruction \"Let there be light\", the Spirit of God gave life to light and for the first time light had life.\n\nThrough-out creation we see the Holy Spirit giving life to so many things including the soul of mankind. The servant of God Job explains further on about the relationship between the Spirit of Life and the creation of mankind.\n\nThe **Spirit of God hath made (created) me** , and the **breath of the Almighty HATH GIVEN ME LIFE.**\n\nJob 33:4\n\nJob describes the Holy Spirit as the breath of the Almighty God who gave him life. The word \"life\" in this scripture is the Hebrew word \"chayah\" which is translated as;\n\n1.To revive.\n\n2.To keep alive.\n\n3.To make alive.\n\n4.To nourish up.\n\n5.To preserve.\n\n6.To quicken.\n\n7.To restore to life.\n\nWe can therefore conclude that the Holy Spirit who is also called the Spirit of Life carries with Him the ability to create things, preserve life and restore life. He is the one who brings eternal life any dead soul through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\nAnd the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and **breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.**\n\nGenesis 2:7\n\nFor the law of the **SPIRIT OF LIFE in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.**\n\nRomans 8:2\n\nThe Spirit of Life is also able to sustain and prolong the earthly life of every Christian through his presence living in every believer. He is able to restore life to any dead or dis-functioning organs in the human body.\n\nFurther- more, the Spirit of Life is able to nourish up a Christian through the revealed Word of God called Rhema.\n\nIf thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, **nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine** , whereunto thou hast attained.\n\n1Timothy 4:6\n\nHe is also able to refresh every Christian by His awesome presence. The Holy Scriptures describe His presence as refreshing.\n\nRepent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when **the TIMES OF REFRESHING shall come from the presence of the LORD** ;\n\nActs 3:19\n\nThe Holy Spirit refreshes the believer with joy, peace, happiness, etc. from His presence. His presence is able to preserve a believer in his relationship with God.\n\nJust getting into His presence takes off all stress and strain. Infact, in the presence of the Spirit of Life there is abundance of Joy. Sometimes we experience this when we attend certain church meetings with all our troubles, frustrations and distresses and without knowing how it happens, we find ourselves forgetting about our issues or being completely relieved of the burden they place of us during our time in the service.\n\n**Thou wilt shew me the path of life** : **IN THY PRESENCE** **IS** **FULNESS OF JOY** ; at **thy right hand** **there are** **pleasures for evermore**.\n\nPsalm 16:11\n\nWhen the anointing of the Spirit of Life is heavily upon a person, that individual is able to help people back on their feet and is also able to restore a broken person; bringing back life, encouragement, faith, hope and love.\n\nAnd after three days and an half **the Spirit of life from God** entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.\n\nRevelations 11:11\nChapter 21\n\n### The SPIRIT OF INTERCESSION\n\nLikewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: **but the Spirit himself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.**\n\nRomans 8:26\n\nThe Holy Spirit makes intercession for Christians through the intercession ministry of fellow believers. To intercede is the Greek word \"huperentugchano\" which is translated as;\n\n1.To act on behalf of another.\n\n2.To speak on behalf of another.\n\n3.To express words on behalf of another.\n\nThis is another important function of the Holy Spirit in the life of Christians worldwide. He speaks and acts on behalf of Christians worldwide through the power of intersession. When a Christian is in deep prayer uttering words which can hardly be understood or expressed, we call that \"the process of groaning\".\n\nTo groan is the Greek word \"stenagmos\" which is translated as;\n\n1.To make unclear utterances from inside you.\n\n2. To sigh deeply.\n\nPraying with other tongues is another way the Holy Spirit intercedes for Christians worldwide. When praying in tongues usually the lips stammer uttering words that are unclear to the mind. Praying in tongues is praying in the spirit.\n\nFor **if I pray in an** **unknown** **tongue** , **my spirit prayeth** , but my **understanding is unfruitful.**\n\n1Corinthians 14:14\n\nWhen a Christian prays in other tongues, he is likely to be interceding for someone or something unknown to him. The utterances made while praying in other tongues are words that is not easily understood by the person unless that person has the gift on interpreting.\n\nWherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.\n\n1Corinthians 14:13\n\n\"Unknown tongues\" is a language or a communication platform between man and God; it also launches a Christian from the earthly realm to operate and communicate in the spirit realm.\n\nFor he that speaketh in an unknown tongue **SPEAKETH NOT UNTO MEN, BUT UNTO GOD** : for no man understandeth him; howbeit **IN THE SPIRIT** he speaketh mysteries.\n\nCorinthians 14:2\n\nWe can therefore understand why it is important for every Christian to pray in an unknown tongue. *Firstly, it is the special utterance given to Christians to communicate directly to God our Heavenly Father without the limitations of our human minds or natural dialect.\n\nSecondly, the ability to pray in an unknown tongue is the ability to intercede for millions of souls worldwide according to the will of God. You see, with the gift of speaking in tongues, the Holy Spirit is able to direct the prayers of Christians to pray for the right things and to pray for those in urgent need of prayer.\n\nAnyone who prays in an unknown tongue does not control the direction of the prayer and may not even understand what he or she is praying about unless that person also has the gift of interpreting the tongues. It's like launching a missile without knowing or being able to control its specific target. The Spirit of Intercession is able to guide the missile (our prayers) to the specific target according to the will of God.\n\nTherefore the Holy Spirit intercedes for millions of souls worldwide through Christians praying in an unknown tongue and through the groaning's produced by the deep prayers of other believers.\n\nDo not be surprised when you are stammering in prayer, uttering words that are unclear to your intellect, have faith in the Word of God and continue making such bold utterances. Do not shy away from speaking in clear tongues or with stammering lips, it is a gift of God.\n\nAs you maturity in the spirit, you will be able to further understand those utterances by the gift of interpretation.\n\nWherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue **pray that he may interpret**.\n\n1Corinthians 14:13\n\nFriends, the Holy Spirit is the greatest person you can ever know and the greatest help you can ever receive. He is your helper, the necessary help you need to fulfil the will of God for your life.\n\nAnd he said, **if the LORD** (the Holy Spirit) **does not help thee** , **whence shall I help thee**?\n\n2Kings 6:27\n\nNo one can be a successful Christian without the Holy Spirit, this is an outstanding statement made by my spiritual father Bishop Dag Heward-Mills; who has trained me and taught me all that I know. What a blessing to have a father and a covering.\n\n###\n\nBack to Top\n\nThank you for reading my book.

Janneke, born and raised in England and currently residing in the Netherlands, gives us a look on Rotterdam through the eyes of an outsider. She writes about the things that stick out and sparkle her interest. This time, Janneke takes us on a guided tour of the city’s wild side.\nGrowing up in England and studying in Scotland, lands of hills, sprawling countryside and eccentricity, it has been difficult getting used to only one way up and one way down a ‘Dutch Mountain’ – or bridge. I start to feel constricted if there’s no winding path to wander; even the meanders are man-made. There’s nothing truly wild about Rotterdam, although at first it strikes you to be a concrete wilderness. Everything seems too controlled for that – at least it tries to be.\nWe are only animals\nHet Park, bending trails regardless, would feel more welcoming if there were mounds to hide behind to pretend you’re alone, or shelter from the North Sea wind that uses the Maas as a funnel.\nStill, amidst the restraint there are the unplanned things that make Rotterdam distinct: single portion sachets of madness squirted on the perfectly cut fries. Canal-side, the birds take advantage of earmarked soggy playground-cum-floodplain to encouragingly patter out a rhythm in the hope of catching a worm. Chattering flocks of green parrots sweep erratically between the carefully positioned trees of Overschie.\nA woman cycles her dog for exercise, on a lead, the dog panting to keep up. That’s efficiency. A man cycles a horse on a lead across a road, the man swerving and ducking to avoid being crushed. That’s proficiency.\nNearly sunset and precisely in the centre of the Willemsbrug, three seagulls are bathing themselves atop the deepest Maas waters. Oblivious to the shipping lanes and tremendous cargoes traversing those same depths, they roll and flap and bead the river down their backs as if it exists only for them.\nRotterdammers themselves mess up the orderliness they have created, or perhaps they are immune to it. We are only animals, after all.\nIn my experience, people embrace the bizarre here more than any other Dutch city. For instance, Kabouter Buttplug is something I can’t imagine going down well in Amsterdam (or any British town centre for that matter), but the sculpture is a readymade symbol of Rotterdam: a little joke to itself, an experiment, a kind of rebellion against polite restraint.\nMore of this, alstublieft\nSome characters punctuate the place: Rod Stewart look-a-likes that roam the Nieuwe and Oude Binnenweg; or Gil and Moti – two unrelated men who dress exactly the same. Either Rotterdam attracts quirkiness, or nurtures it – maybe both.\nIt’s certainly an acquired taste: not everyone’s cup of tea. But Rotterdammers appreciate their unorthodox city with its layers of planning schemes in constant flux, as much as they respect the idiosyncrasies of its inhabitants (be it people or other creatures). Crazy within reason.\nI think I have that tolerant disposition, which is partly what brought me here. However, in my opinion, there’s still room for Rotterdam to let its hair down and become a little more wild.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "6a048775-fe80-4d07-a974-955e6e994762", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "09adf9b9-e7a0-4517-a340-22b828584a8d", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "7948d0c0-cf42-4942-9e70-41c9a0cb5426", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001579", "creator": "jinzhenjiang", "data_id": "b33fa45a-9b58-4f29-8537-c44e129fff07", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "113966", "creator": "chupei", "data_id": "a5413c7a-7ed9-4c2a-a390-32358c89cd9d", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "051560", "creator": "zengzhiyuan", "data_id": "e5c1c2a1-7580-4430-a941-11dd7d3c1c32", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Another problem with the predictive texting is that when it starts to predict a whole phrase it gets 'lost' & freezes, which can be got out of by selecting to view the 'Msg Details'. It also seems to forget new words it has 'learnt' after only a few texts, and has a minimal dictionary to start with.\nThere are also a number of other 'quirks' (aka faults) with the software, e.g. the first new contact added after the 'phone is switched on each time won't be accessible other than to delete it and enter it again - not so bad when you've worked out what is happening!\nThe good point is that it has lots of memory, but overall the software is confusing (I was a software designer in a previous life so I'm qualified to comment), and has bugs in it that are unacceptable.

Had a meeting this morning at Harvard Business School, followed by a mediocre roast turkey sandwich for lunch, so I started looking for some comfort and found it first in the fabulous Harvard Book Store where passionate readers from around the world meet from dawn to dusk and until quite late at night, and there’s a great cooking shelf, too.\nHave been strolling quiet avenues then for quite a while. I was walking tiny streets bordered by university departments, stem cell institutes, rocket science cathedrals and precious private houses hidden in precious private gardens where well-dressed ladies were raking gravel paths or walking giant poodles. By then, I was sure that I would find something nice for dinner in such a plush environment…\nAnd so it was: I found Ten Tables, a New American restaurant, highly ranked by the Zagat guide and chosen as the best restaurant in 2009 by Boston magazine. The chef can boast to have 27 out of 30 possible Zagat points which in the logic of the food guide means that he’s close to perfection. I would say: he’s very, very good. Some of his dishes are outstanding, some are not. I was going for the surprise menu dégustation, four courses for 42 US$ (35 Euros) and here’s what I’ve got:\nAt first, a magnificent cold soup made of a lot of white vegetables. There was asparagus involved, small radish, and the overall texture was creamy without any cream, buttery without butter, so this one came out of the molecular lab which didn’t surprise me, actually, dining so close to the M.I.T. Next, there was fish.\nScottish “organic” salmon to be correct, enthroned on a bed of young spinach leaves and apples and raisins, topped with (very) sweet pepper. This was a real New World dish, I’d say, very tasty, extremely tasty even, on the brink of exaggeration but bold at the same time and absolutely not boring, very much on the exiting side.\nThe meat course was a marinated hanger steak, that’s the piece the French call onglet, a rare and beautiful chunk of beef, yet the Ten Tables‘ chef had decided to kill it twice. He took the dead meat and built it into a over-the-top composition of onions and potatoes and sour cream and salad and a very dominant, Turkish-style garlic sausage, a weird failure. Weird, because the meat was brilliantly done, cooked to perfection, and if the cook had only added salt and pepper and maybe some thyme, it would have been just wonderful. Like this, it wasn’t, and if I was working for Zagat, I’d give 30 points for the product and not many for the cooking; too much stem cell theory involved instead of, pardon me, just having sex.\nGreedy as I am I ordered some American raw milk sheep cheese (San Andreas) which was fabulous (but again over-decorated with leaves and “peach mustard” and nuts and stuff). The kitchen then sent a perfect little verrine filled with a rhubarb mousse and an amazingly beautiful buttermilk sorbet (which, in Europe, would have been served before the meat course). And then it was dessert time, finally, and the chef was back to the summit.\nI don’t really know what he served there but it had to do with the US military strategy of shock & awe, it was a real chocolate attack just perfectly checked by a wonderfully spiced icecream, a fine moment for bravos and a real reason for a deep bow to a chef who – across the board – really knows what he’s doing and why. Brilliant staff.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "cade6740-c28e-45f5-bfaa-578a6658a777", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "5661ad3e-f9a6-4c06-a2e1-cfd26bba016a", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "6a2c1840-342f-4a39-8338-3b71b16688e2", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001579", "creator": "jinzhenjiang", "data_id": "8e816e24-9e12-4474-9e62-c1ddada39079", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "113966", "creator": "chupei", "data_id": "7f32eade-a01c-4a86-aef6-0bb29ba7d502", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "051560", "creator": "zengzhiyuan", "data_id": "c0c69611-4f37-4fe2-9fec-b3fca7fe8fd0", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Technology, and the informational age, broadens my appreciation of what people are capable of in this amazing landscape of growing the minds of today's youth within our K-12 system.\nRecently I was able to sit in on interview's of three perspective candidates for Superintendent for a rather large school district in central Ohio. Each one brought their own perspective on education, and leadership, and that was to be expected. What was most interesting though was the thread that bound them together. One would argue that this is common sense, and cliche says that it would have been \"the kids\", however it was the fact that they all spoke about preparing our kids for a \"future that doesn't exit\". With that being shared, each candidate moved right into technology, and all its possibilities. Impressive.\nThat is the reality of where we are in today's academic landscape. Just like the candidates stated today, we have to educate our school communities on the significance of technology in our classrooms and in our learning. Technology means many things, and for that, the work has just begun.\nMy experience is currently at the secondary level where the field is ripe for technology within the bells. My school has adopted a BYOD culture and teachers are slowly, but surely, coming to an understanding and appreciation of what is capable when we dive into the BYOD opportunities. We discuss the barriers, find creative solutions and continue to push forward in our thirst for giving kids an authentic experience with technology. We do this in the hopes that this assists them in their learning and that it will open the doors to a profession, a skill, that may yet to exist.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "342b9c9f-89cd-4c7e-a944-ac84dcb7db8c", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "0a4e4135-7a2c-4dda-ab54-1dc1a5ac26fe", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "ace99925-9ba4-4baf-b1e9-6709f9cb9097", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001579", "creator": "jinzhenjiang", "data_id": "1f65f06b-4547-4b78-b79a-62c6d666d0ea", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "113966", "creator": "chupei", "data_id": "74bcf2f0-10ce-40aa-9347-bd035c978a27", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "051560", "creator": "zengzhiyuan", "data_id": "129c2c46-60c9-40bd-83be-d3b7b0d69a5a", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Good was triumphant, and as a result Humanity has lived happily ever after.\n\nBut supposing Evil threw the fight ...\n\nAnd supposing Good cheated ...\n\nHe stepped off the plane into the belly of the snake; the long, winding tube thing they shove right up to the cabin door, so that newly arrived foreigners don't get a really close look at dear old England until they're through passport control and it's too late.\n\nHe didn't actually have a passport; but he explained at the barrier exactly why he didn't need one, and so they let him through. In answer to his polite enquiry, they told him, 'Britain'. They even urged him to have a nice day, which was rather like imploring petrol to burn.\n\nDown the steps he went, into the baggage hall. The carousel was empty and the indicator board expressed the view that the luggage from Flight BA666 might be along in about half an hour, maybe forty minutes, call it an hour to be on the safe side, provided always it hadn't got on the wrong plane by mistake; in which case, it was probably having a far more exotic holiday than its owners had just returned from, and would probably settle down over there, adopt new owners, and lead a much fuller, richer life than it could ever have had in a damp, miserable country like this. He read the board and smiled indulgently. Then he concentrated.\n\nThe first item to roll out through the little rubber flaps was a big, old-fashioned steamer trunk. He looked at it, head slightly on one side, pursed his lips and shook his head. 'Smaller,' he said. The trunk went round and disappeared.\n\nNext came a matching three-piece set of designer pigskin travelware, with very fancy brass locks, little wheels for ease of handling, and monogrammed straps. He shook his head vigorously, and the travelware, handles drooping with shame, made itself scarce.\n\nThen came a medium-sized plain vinyl suitcase, no wheels. He was clearly tempted because he picked it up and tested the weight. But it must have seemed too heavy or too bulky because he put it back again, and a moment later it too trickled out through the flaps. A similar item, more or less exactly the same except for the colour and the contours of the handle, came next, but was dismissed with a slight pucker of the lips and a small sideways head movement.\n\nIt was followed a moment later by a simple black canvas holdall, with webbing handles and a shoulder strap. He looked at it, nodded and picked it up. He unzipped it; it was empty. When he zipped it up again, it was full. He looked around until he saw the exit sign and walked on briskly. Needless to say, the Customs men didn't even seem to notice him.\n\nBefore leaving the airport, he went to the men's toilet to brush his hair and see what he looked like. He hadn't had a chance to look in a mirror or a pool of water since he'd died, and although he was determined to spend as little time as possible in this poxy runabout Lada of a body, a certain human curiosity came with the hardware. He stepped up to the mirror.\n\nIf he'd been expecting a disappointment, he was disappointed. They don't advertise the fact, but the Heathrow men's bogs house the world's last surviving scrying-mirror, an antisocially cunning piece of kit which treats appearances with the scorn that Mercedes salesmen reserve for people who live in council houses, and lets you see yourself as you truly are. Back in the heroic past, no self-respecting wizard stirred out of doors without one; it was the only way to filter out all the gods disguised as mortals, princes masquerading as frogs, wolves in grandmothers' clothing and other pests which made the Dark Ages such a wretchedly fraught experience. This particular example now belongs to the syndicate who hold the airport's duty-free concession. It's linked to the video surveillance system and makes it possible for them to spot a mug punter before he's even checked in his luggage.\n\nHe saw a huge shape. If you love understatement and have just had your soul repossessed by the finance company, you could say he looked a bit like a lizard; except that lizards are generally smaller than, say, Jersey and don't have enormous wings, and even naturalists (who get paid for loving all of God's creatures) tend to look at their faces and think immediately of their spouses' relations. The face in the mirror, on the other claw, was beautiful in the same way that weapons and warships and violent electric storms over the sea at sunset can be beautiful.\n\nThe dragon clicked his tongue impatiently. He'd seen that before. More to the point, that wonderful, dangerously attractive shape he was looking at had been significantly dead for thousands of years, ever since one George de la Croix (alias Dragon George Cody; better known to divinity as Saint George) had kebabbed it with a whacking great spear. One day, probably quite soon, he'd get another dragon body and look like that again; right now he was wearing a standard K-Mart two-leg, two-arm, pink hairless monkey costume - the equivalent of the cheap grey suit they give you when you're demobbed or let out of prison - and he wanted to see what he looked like in that. He turned to the next mirror along and saw a human male, powerfully built as humans go, medium height, longish dark hair and short, clipped beard with grey icing, and round yellow eyes with black slits for pupils.\n\nAh well, he thought. If you wear off the peg, you've got to take what you get. He was no expert in human fashions - in his day, nearly all the humans he came across wore steel boiler-suits with helmets like coal scuttles, and that was a very long time ago. It would probably do, until he got the dragon outfit back. And then, of course, everything would be different anyway.\n\nOnce outside he raised a hand, whereupon a taxi drew up and opened its door. That was, in fact, a curious occurrence in itself, since the last thing the taxi driver could remember was turning left out of Regent Street and swerving to avoid a right-hand-drive Maserati. He also had a notion that he'd had a passenger on board. Evidently not, for the cab was empty.\n\n'Where to?' the driver asked.\n\n'Licensed premises,' he replied. Then he threw his bag onto the back seat and climbed in.\n\nThe driver, a Londoner, didn't actually know of any pubs in the Heathrow area, and confessed as much. His fare replied that in that case, they could learn together. 'Just drive around,' he suggested, 'until we see something I like the look of.'\n\nAnd so they did. They'd been cruising up and down lanes for maybe half an hour when he suddenly leaned forward, rapped on the glass and said, 'That one.'\n\n'You're the boss.'\n\n'Yes.'\n\nHaving explained to the driver exactly why he didn't actually owe him any money, he waved him goodbye, shouldered his bag and crunched up the path to the front door. The landlord of the George and Dragon was, at that precise moment, asleep in bed - it was ten past ten in the morning, and yesterday had been a late darts night - so he was more than a little confused when, about one second after the doorknocker crashed down on its brass anvil, he found himself in the bar, fully dressed, shooting back the bolts.\n\n'Morning. You open?'\n\n'I think so.'\n\n'That's fine. Large whisky, please, no ice.'\n\nThe customer had a fine thirst on him; ten large whiskies, one after another, appeared to have no more effect than airgun pellets fired at the side of a battleship. Ah well, thought the landlord, obviously a very lucky man. 'Another?' he suggested.\n\n'Please,' the customer replied. 'What's that one with the green and black label?'\n\nThe landlord peered. 'Bourbon,' he replied, stating the brand name. 'A hundred and five proof,' he added.\n\nThe customer smiled. 'Ah,' he said. 'That's what I call fire water. Make it a treble, and have one for yourself.'\n\nJust as the customer said it, the landlord realised how much he needed a drink at precisely that moment. He reworked the optic, mumbled 'Here's health,' and knocked back the glass, the contents of which did to his head what Guy Fawkes wanted to do to Parliament. 'Good stuff,' he croaked.\n\n'Not bad, I suppose,' replied the customer. 'Same again.'\n\nIt occurred to the landlord that it would only be polite to make a little conversation, and he asked the customer what line of business he was in. It seemed that he'd inadvertently made a joke, because the customer grinned.\n\n'Let's see,' he replied. 'Let's say I'm a flier.'\n\n'Pilot, you mean?'\n\n'Sort of.' He felt in his top pocket, extracted a cigarette, drew on it heavily and exhaled. The smoke seemed to fill the bar.\n\n'Civil or military?' the barman asked.\n\n'Bit of both. What's that colourless stuff in the bottle with the red label?'\n\n'Kirsch.'\n\n'Treble of that, then, and next I'd like to try the other colourless stuff with the green label.'\n\n'That's Polish vodka, that is. Hundred and forty per cent proof. Beats me,' the landlord went on, 'how something can be a hundred and forty per cent anything. I thought a hundred per cent was the limit; you know, like a hundred out of a hundred?'\n\nNot long afterwards, the customer got up, thanked the landlord, and left him musing on three points that were puzzling him. Probably because his head was still glowing from the bourbon, he couldn't quite get a handle on any of them.\n\nOne; how come the man who had just left had managed to put away roughly ninety-seven centilitres of spirits in ten minutes and still been able to breathe, let alone walk jauntily out of the front door with no apparent impairment of his motor functions?\n\nTwo; the reason he had given for not paying had been utterly convincing, fair and square, no problems whatsoever on that score, but what had it been, exactly?\n\nThree; just how in hell had he been able to smoke for five minutes without actually lighting the cigarette?\n\nBianca Wilson had first made her mark on Norton Poly-technic when she suddenly stood up in the middle of a class and put her clothes on.\n\nIgnoring the comments, she then stepped down off the platform, took possession of the vacant easel and proceeded to paint a breathtaking still life of three herrings and a typewriter ribbon. After that, there was no question of mucking about with application forms; not only was she in the class, she was its star pupil. When asked what had prompted her to make the change from model to practitioner, she replied that it was warmer and you didn't have to keep still.\n\nSculpture proved to be her true medium. She stripped away marble as if it was cellophane wrapping to reveal the always implicit statue beneath. Once she'd learned the basics of the craft, such as how to sharpen a chisel and the best way to avoid clouting your thumb, it was obvious that there was nothing more that Norton Tech could teach her. Accordingly, she thanked them very much, gave up the day job by the simple but eloquent expedient of telling the office manager what he could do with it, and spent her last ten pounds on a ticket to London. She travelled, of course, in the guard's van; it had taken five porters, the conductor and three gullible Royal Marines to get her luggage on board, and the Spirit of World Peace had to make the journey with her left leg sticking out of the window.\n\nSmall-town girl in the big city; well, so was Joan of Arc, not to mention Boadicea. A talent like Bianca's is always hard to keep hidden, particularly when its manifestations are ten feet high and weigh close to a ton and a half. It took the proprietor of the Herries Street Gallery, stepping off the train at Paddington, fifteen seconds to recognise true genius when he saw it, three quarters of an hour to hire a suitably heavy-duty lorry, and six weeks of humiliating negotiation to get Bianca's signature on a contract. The rest is art history, with cross-references to economics, accountancy and business studies.\n\nThus, when, about eighteen months later, Birmingham City Council was playing third time lucky with the design of the city's celebrated Victoria Square, and the Kawaguchiya Integrated Circuits people came across with a six-figure garden gnome fund, there was only one possible choice; provided she would agree to do it. For a very long fortnight she considered the offer; any subject she liked (except, added the city fathers, World Peace, because you do tend to get just a wee bit carried away on that particular theme, and we need a bit of space in the square for buildings and stuff) and as long as she liked to do it in, all the rock she could handle plus, of course, the immense satisfaction of helping gild Europe's most fragrant lily. Could anybody refuse an offer like that? Apparently, yes.\n\nThe city fathers faxed Kawaguchiya Integrated Circuits, tactfully suggesting that the two in their original letter must have been a misprint for three. KIC, thinking wistfully of the sixty acres of Tyseley they'd set their hearts on, faxed back their confirmation. Bianca accepted.\n\nAfter careful consideration, she had narrowed the choice of subjects down to two. One of them, she told the Council, was the Industrial Revolution raping Nature, with side friezes of captains of industry through the ages suffering appropriate torments in Hell. Did they want to hear the other choice? No, Ms Wilson, that'll do fine. No, the other one will be just splendid, whatever it turns out to be.\n\nTo their amazement and relief, it turned out to be Saint George and the Dragon. Nobody could guess why, least of all Bianca Wilson.\n\nAfter leaving the pub, he strolled for a while along the quiet, winding road. He had much to think about.\n\nWell, it sure was good to be back. The shape; well, it was limiting, not to mention uncomfortable and intrinsically silly, but he'd be rid of it soon enough and then he'd really be back. He swung the holdall by its handle, and smiled at the clanking of its contents.\n\nEngland; not that he'd seen very much of it, but probably enough for his purposes. Lots of trees, he observed. Haystacks. Fields of waving, sun-ripened corn. Thatched cottages. Perfect. It was a wonder the United Nations hadn't made them tie a label on it saying _Highly Inflammable._ A lorryload of straw bales chugged past him and he grinned.\n\nHe felt well. True, the actual fuel content in fermented liquor wasn't all that high, and he'd probably have done better in practical terms to have called in at a petrol station and taken a long swig from the pumps. But there was no point in going out of one's way to appear conspicuous, or at least not yet. Pretty soon he'd be so conspicuous they'd be offering him a Saturday job as a lighthouse. Patience, patience.\n\nThe summer breeze was warm on his back and he instinctively looked upwards. Good thermals, if he wasn't mistaken. On a lovely calm day like this it was horribly frustrating to be stuck on the ground. As if in sympathy, his shoulder-blades began to itch and he paused a while to scratch them against a gatepost.\n\nWhile he was standing and looking at the sky, he became aware of an unusual noise; a bit like thunder, a bit like the roar of a food-processor in full cry, with a tantalising hint of movement and a dash of power. A moment later, two jet fighters swept across the sky, flying perhaps a trifle lower than regulations permitted. They were only visible for a second and a half at most, but in that time his exceptional eyes scanned them and reported every detail of their appearance and construction to a suddenly lovesick brain. True, he'd come across aircraft before, like the big fat lumbering thing he'd come in on - a huge flying metal slug, a parody of flight. These, though, were something else entirely. It was as if a man brought up in strict seclusion by elderly nuns had just wandered into the changing room at a top-flight fashion show. Yes, shouted every fibre of his being, I _want_ one of those.\n\nHe concentrated and quite soon one of the fighters came back. At his subsequent court-martial, the pilot was unable to offer any explanation. The best he could come up with was that it was a sunny day, it looked like a nice place, and there was this friendly looking man in the road below waggling his thumb.\n\n'Hi.'\n\nThe pilot pressed a button and the windshield slid back. 'Hello,' he replied. 'What...?'\n\n'Nice machine you've got there.'\n\n'Yes. Um ...'\n\n'I particularly like the way it just sort of drops in on the ground. I always thought you had to find a flat open space and come in gradually.'\n\n'Not any more,' replied the pilot. 'Vertical take-off and landing. Look—'\n\n'Mind if I have a go?'\n\n'Well, actually, it doesn't belong to me, so perhaps—'\n\n'Ah, go on.'\n\n'All right.'\n\nThere were, he noticed as he clambered into the cockpit, all sorts of knobs and levers and things which presumably made the thing go. Superfluous, of course, in his case. He applied his mind.\n\n'Excuse me!'\n\nHe looked down at the pilot. 'Yes?'\n\n'Before you take off,' shouted the pilot above the roar of the engines, 'put the windshield back up. Otherwise you'll be blown—'\n\n'Thanks, but no thanks. I get claustrophobic in confined spaces.' How true. How very, very true. 'Cheerio.'\n\nThen ... straight up in the air, no messing. This was something he could get used to. And to think, last time he'd been here the best the poor fools could do was stick feathers to their arms with beeswax and jump off cliffs. All credit to them, they'd certainly been busy.\n\nAs the slipstream clawed vainly at his face and the ground became a fast-moving blur far below him, he snuggled back in his seat, sighed with pure contentment and groped with his mind for the weapons systems.\n\nBianca was used to inspiration. Scarcely a day went by without some rare and splendid gift of the gods slipping in through the cat-flap of her mind and curling up, nose to tail-tip, in front of the radiator of her genius. It was getting to the stage where she couldn't walk past a stone-built building without seeing hundreds of enticing images peeping out at her from the heart of the masonry, like socks leering through the glass door of a tumble-drier.\n\nThe Birmingham job, though, was something else entirely. A terrible cliché, of course, to say the thing had taken on a life of its own, but that was about the strength of it. The further the work progressed - and she was amazed at how far she'd got in such a short time—the less actual control she seemed to have. Not that the work was inferior - on the contrary, it was superb, if you liked naturalism in your sculpture. But it was odd, because neither Saint George nor his scaly chum were turning out anything like the way she'd imagined them. George, she couldn't help thinking, ought to be taller, more heroic, less - well, dumpy and middle aged. He should only have one chin, and that a sort of Kirk Douglas job, the kind of thing you could surround with sea and put a concert party on the end of. He certainly shouldn't have round little piggy eyes and a squadgy little mouth like two slugs mating. And as for the dragon ...\n\nBut, she had to admit, she did like the dragon. It had style. In fact, it had so much style you could bolt a wheel at each corner and give it an Italian name. It was graceful, attractive, dangerous; you could see the power in those tremendous muscles and hear the whistle of the wind in those amazingly broad, delicate wings. Above all, it made you think, if someone came up to you and offered to bet you money on the outcome of the fight, you wouldn't take George'at anything less than seventy-five to one. The result had to be a foregone conclusion.\n\nShe said as much to her friend Mike one evening as he helped her with the tarpaulins. Mike nodded.\n\n'I wouldn't want to have just sold George a life policy,' he said. 'A single-premium annuity, yes. I think I'd be on pretty safe ground there. But straight life or accidental death cover, no.'\n\n'Strange,' Bianca agreed. 'Do you think it might be symbolism?'\n\n'Probably. What did you have in mind?'\n\n'Well.' Bianca stood back and took a long, dispassionate look. 'There's all sorts of things it could be symbolising, actually.'\n\n'Such as?'\n\n'Um. The ultimate futility of imperialism?'\n\n'Nice try.'\n\n'Um. Male violence towards women?'\n\n'Could be. In which case, the male is definitely on a hiding to nothing, unless you chip off George's moustache and beef the pectorals up a bit. Talking of his moustache, by the way, had you noticed the strong resemblance to Alf Garnett?'\n\n'All right, then,' Bianca said. 'How about World Peace?'\n\n'Ah,' said Mike, nodding. 'Silly of me not to have realised before.'\n\nBianca sighed. 'You're right,' she said, 'it's definitely up the pictures. Here, help me get the sheet over it before I get too depressed.'\n\n'Didn't say I didn't like it,' Mike replied, as a gust of wind turned the tarpaulin into a mainsail. 'I think it's absolutely amazing. It's just...'\n\n'Yes. Quite.'\n\n'How much more are you planning on doing to it?'\n\n'I don't know,' Bianca replied pensively. 'Either I'm going to leave it pretty much as it is, or else I'm going to take a sledgehammer to it first thing tomorrow morning. What do you think?'\n\n'I think,' said Mike, 'that if you choose Plan B, I could use the chippings. There'd be enough to cover every driveway in the West Midlands.'\n\nAt that moment, the rogue Harrier jet that had been shooting cathedral-sized divots out of Salisbury Plain suddenly stopped in mid-air, stalled and fell into a spin, dropping out of the air like a shot bird.\n\nCuddled in the arms of a warm thermal, the dragon watched it fall and shrugged. He'd been wrong. Compared to his real shape, it was just a toy; fancy dress, a tin overcoat. As it hit the ground and exploded, he flicked his tail like a goldfish, rose and hovered over the swelling mushroom of smoke and fire. Ruddy dangerous, too, he added. One little bump on the ground and they blow up. Shit, I could have been inside that. Doesn't bear thinking about.\n\nHe throttled back to a slow, exhilarating glide and began an inventory of his new shape. Neat. And gaudy too, which he liked. A little bit more gold wouldn't have hurt and maybe a few more precious stones here and there; still, what did you expect from something that owed its original genesis to local government? But in terms of function, of efficiency and power-to-weight ratios, he couldn't fault it. For a moment, he almost wished there were other dragons in the world. He'd have enjoyed giving them the name of his tailor.\n\nWhen Bianca arrived on site the next morning, the tarpaulin was already off and Mike was struggling to fold it; in this wind, a bit like trying to cram the universe into a paper bag. He looked up and gave her a sad smile.\n\n'I asked you to save me the chippings,' he said.\n\n'Sorry?'\n\n'That's all right. Next time.'\n\n'No, sorry as in what the hell are you talking about.'\n\nMike frowned. 'The dragon,' he said, pointing. 'You came back last night and scrapped it. Quick work.'\n\n'No I didn't,' Bianca said, pointing. 'It's still ...'\n\nGone.\n\nWhen you're a dragon, sobering up can be a nasty experience.\n\nThe last of the Polish vodka burned off just as he was attempting a flamboyant triple loop, about seventy thousand feet above sea level, and sixty-nine thousand feet directly above the very pointy tips of some mountains. At that point, something nudged him in the ribs, gave him an unpleasant leer, and said, 'Hi, remember me?' It was Gravity.\n\nFortunately, he had sufficient height and enough of a breeze to glide quite comfortably down onto a flat green stretch in the middle of the large human settlement he was presently overflying. As he made his approach, he noticed that his chosen landing strip was dotted with humans, all dressed in white and staring up at him, while around the edges of the field, crammed onto rows of wooden benches, were several thousand other humans, also staring. The dragon was puzzled for a moment. He didn't have a fly, so it couldn't be undone. Hadn't they ever seen a dragon before?\n\nHaving felt for the wind, he put his wings back, stretched out his legs, turned into the breeze and dropped lightly down onto the turf, landing as delicately as a cat jumping up onto a cluttered mantelpiece. The white men had all run away, he observed, and the spectators - he assumed that was what they were doing; either that or they were some kind of jury - were trying to do the same, although they were finding it hard because they were all trying to do it at the same time. Some blue men were walking towards him with the slow, measured tread of people who feel they aren't being paid enough to die. He wished there was something he could do to put them at their ease. He was, however, a realist; the only thing he'd ever managed to do that helped human beings relax was to go away, and unless he could get to a gallon or so of strong drink, that wasn't among the available options.\n\nOr maybe it was. The green area was divided from the rows of benches by a thin wall of painted boards, with words on them; National Westminster Bank, Equity and Law and - he recognised that one - Bell's Whisky. That, if he wasn't mistaken, was one of the brands of fuel he'd taken on board at the pub. If they had its name written up on a hoarding, perhaps they had some about the place. It would do no harm to ask.\n\n'Hello,' he said.\n\nAt once, the blue men stopped dead in their tracks, and began talking frantically to little rectangular boxes pinned to the collars of their coats. This puzzled the dragon at first, until he worked out that the boxes were some sort of pet, that his rather loud, booming voice had frightened them, and the blue men were comforting them with soothing words. The dragon rebuked himself for being inconsiderate and lowered his voice a little.\n\n'Hello,' he repeated. 'I wonder if you could help me. Have you got any Bell's Whisky?'\n\nPerhaps the little boxes didn't approve of whisky, because they needed even more calming down this time. Painfully aware that tact had never been his strong point, the dragon modulated his voice into a sort of low, syrupy hum, and beckoned to the nearest of the blue men.\n\n'Excuse me,' he cooed. The blue man stared, until the dragon was afraid his eyeballs would fall out of his head, assured his pet box that it was all right really, and took a few nervous steps forward. The dragon considered a friendly smile, but thought better of it. His friendly smiles, it had to be admitted, did rather tend to resemble an ivory-hunter's discount warehouse. It'd probably frighten the poor little box out of its wits.\n\n'You talking to me?' said the blue man, in a rather quavery voice.\n\n'Yes,' replied the dragon. 'Bell's Whisky. Is there any?'\n\n'What you want whisky for?'\n\nSoftly, softly is all very well, but the dragon was beginning to get impatient. 'I'll give you three guesses,' he replied. 'Look, either you have or you haven't, it's not exactly a grey area.'\n\n'I don't know,' the blue man replied. 'I'm a policeman, not a bartender.'\n\n'I see. Would you know if you were a bartender?'\n\n'I suppose so. Why?'\n\nThe dragon sighed. If it had had a fuel gauge, it would be well into the red zone by now, but even so the flames that inadvertently ensued were four feet long and hot enough to melt titanium. 'Perhaps,' he said, observing that the policeman had gone ever such a funny colour, 'you'd be terribly sweet and go and fetch me a bartender, so that we can get this point cleared up once and for all.'\n\n'Um. Yes. Right.'\n\n'Thank you ever so much.'\n\n'Um. Don't mention it.'\n\n'Hope the flames didn't frighten your box.'\n\nThe blue man backed away, turned and ran; and for a long time, the dragon sat quietly where he was, conserving his energy and watching the pigeons waddling about on the grass. The whole area was empty by now, except for two or three of the blue men, huddled behind benches at the very back. It dawned on the dragon that something was going on. He frowned. It was, he felt, a bit much. Back in the old days, the humans hadn't made this much fuss when he dropped in on cities demanding princesses to go, hold the onions.\n\nYou'd think, he reiterated to himself, they'd never seen a dragon before.\n\nHey!\n\nMaybe they _hadn't_ seen a dragon before.\n\nAnything's possible. Perhaps, in this strange and rather down-at-heel century, dragons had become scarce. If this was a remote, out-of-the-way district (his exceptional eyes, scanning generally for a clue, picked out the name Old Trafford written on a board, but it didn't mean anything to him) then it was conceivable that he was the first dragon they'd ever set eyes on. Reviewed in that light, the behaviour of the humans made some sort of sense. Rewind that and let's think it through logically.\n\nAssume they've never actually seen a dragon. They will, nevertheless, have heard of dragons; everybody has. And, facing facts, he wasn't so naïve as to imagine that what they'd heard was necessarily accurate. Humans, he knew, are funny buggers, delighting in the morbid and the sensational, eclectic in their selection of what to remember and what conveniently to forget. Quite likely, that was the case when it came to the popular image of dragons. If he knew humans, they'd ignore the ninety-nine per cent of its time a dragon spends aimlessly flying, basking in the high-level sunlight, chivvying rainclouds to where they're needed most and persuading winds to behave themselves. More likely than not, the perverse creatures would focus on the five per cent or less of its life a dragon spends at ground level, ridding the world of unwanted and troublesome armour fetishists and saving kings the trouble of finding husbands for superfluous younger daughters.\n\nIn which case ...\n\nDamn.\n\nWhat a time, the dragon reflected ruefully, to run out of gas. Because any minute now, some macho nerd on a white charger is going to come galloping up through the gate with an overgrown cocktail stick under his arm, hell-bent on prodding me in the ribs. Normally, of course, this wouldn't pose any sort of problem; one sneeze, and all that's left is some fine grey ash and a pool of slowly cooling molten iron.\n\nWithout fuel, however, he was going to have to rely on teeth and fingernails, which was a pest because it was ever so easy to crack a molar on those silly iron hats they insisted on wearing, and if dragons really are scarce, chances are there's precious few competent serpentine dentists within convenient waddling distance.\n\nWhat I need, muttered the dragon to himself, is a good stiff drink of kerosene. He turned his head slowly from side to side, dilated his nostrils and sniffed. Over there ...\n\nAt the back of the enclosure some tall iron gates swung open and four strange green vehicles rolled through. They were big, made of iron and fitted with long iron ribbons under their wheels - socks? go-anywhere doormats? - and when the dragon pricked up his exceptional ears, he heard a blue man by the gate shout to a colleague that it was going to be all right, the tanks were here now.\n\nTanks.\n\nYes, right, said the dragon to himself, _tanks,_ I remember now. Big metal vessels used for the storage of liquids. At long last, here comes the Bell's Whisky. And there was me thinking they were out to get me.\n**CHAPTER TWO**\n\n**I** t can't,' Bianca protested, 'just have disappeared.'\n\nMike shrugged and made a pantomime of patting his pockets and poking about in Bianca's toolbag. 'Bee, love, it's a tad on the big side to have rolled away and fallen down a grating somewhere. Of course it's flaming well disappeared. Obviously, someone's pinched it.'\n\n'Pinched a fifteen-foot-long statue of a dragon? Kids, maybe? Bored housewife who didn't know what came over her? Don't be so bloody stupid. It'd take a whole day just to saw it off the plinth.'\n\n'True.' Mike peered down at the stone beneath Saint George's charger's hooves. 'And no saw marks, either. In fact, no marks of any kind. You know, this is downright peculiar.'\n\n'Peculiar.' Bianca closed her mouth, which had fallen open. 'Mike, if ever Mars challenges us to an understatement match, I'm going to nominate you for team captain. What the hell am I going to _do?'_\n\nMike scratched his head. 'You could start by telling somebody. The police. Birmingham City Council. Kawaguchiya Integrated...'\n\nHe met Bianca's eye. Comparable meetings include that between Napoleon and Wellington at Waterloo and the encounter between Mohammed Ali's solar plexus and Joe Frazier's fist back in 1974. 'Quite,' he said. 'I see what you mean. This is going to be a problem, isn't it?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Do you think,' Mike suggested, after a moment's consideration, 'that you could, sort of, talk your way out of this? I mean, it's your blasted statue. Convince 'em that there never was a dragon to begin with. Sort of, Saint George and the _implied_ dragon. Saint George, just practising? Saint George and Imaginary Friend?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'Maybe not. Or could you lose the armour, fiddle around with the sword a bit and rename it _The Polo Player?'_\n\n'Mike.'\n\n'Okay, okay, I'm just bouncing a few ideas here. Here, why not just call it _Study for Saint George and the ...'_\n\nBianca closed her eyes and massaged them with the heel of her hand. 'What I can't imagine,' she said, 'is what the hell can have happened to it. I mean, dragons don't just get up and walk away. Just to move something that size you'd need cranes, flat-bodied trucks, hydraulics, all that stuff. Believe me,' she added, 'I know. When I delivered that cameo group of Mother and Child in Macclesfield last year, they had to close off fifteen streets.'\n\nThey stood for a few seconds longer, staring at the absence - a distinctly dragon-shaped absence, but an absence nevertheless. Compared to how Bianca was feeling about vacuums, Nature was honorary treasurer of their fan club.\n\n'Well,' said Bianca at last, 'there's no point standing here like trainee lamp-posts. Help me cover the dratted thing up, what's left of it, and I'll get on to the wholesalers for some more white Carrera. I only hope they can match the grain.'\n\nMike nodded. 'What about him?' he added, jerking a thumb at Saint George. 'Want me to put a padlock on him or something?'\n\nBianca gave him the last in a succession of withering looks; if the Americans had had looks like that in 1972, the Viet Cong would never have stood a chance. 'Get real,' she sighed. 'Who the hell is going to steal a statue?'\n\nChug, chug, chug; an elderly coach, the sort of vehicle that can still call itself a charabanc and get away with it, burbles slowly and cheerfully like a relaxed bumble-bee along a winding Oxfordshire lane.\n\nOn either side of the road, Cotswold sheep, as self-consciously picturesque as the most highly paid super-model, ruminate and regurgitate in timeless serenity. Thatched cottages, tile-roofed golden-stone farmhouses, evocatively falling-down old barns and the last surviving old-fashioned telephone boxes in Albion are the only footprints left here by the long march of Humanity; and if these works of his hand were all you had to go by, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Man wasn't a bad old stick after all. For this is the rural Thames Valley, the land that Time forgot, scenery pickled in formaldehyde. If England was Dorian Grey, this would be the watercolour landscape he keeps in his attic.\n\nInevitably and on schedule, there to the left of the coach is a village cricket match, and the big, red-faced man toiling up to the crease is, ineluctably, the village blacksmith. For a slice of living palaeontology, forget _Jurassic Park_ and come to North Oxon.\n\nAnd here is the village, and here is the village green, and here are the ducks. The coach pulls up, wheezing humorously, and the passengers spill out; fifteen elderly ladies with flasks and sandwiches, deck chairs and knitting. It's all so sweet you could use it to flavour tea.\n\nThirty seconds later, a black transit van with tinted windows purrs noiselessly up and parks at the back of the green. The doors do not open. It lurks.\n\nThe old ladies have laid out their tartan rugs and, after much comical by-play and merry laughter, put up their deck chairs. The sun is shining. Tea flows. Sandwiches are eaten.\n\nTime is, of course, not a constant. Science would have you believe that it potters along at a fixed, unalterable speed, never accelerating, never slowing down; rather like a milk float. Big joke. Time has a gearbox; it can dawdle and it can race. This, in turn, can result in absolute chaos.\n\nSupply and demand, twin pillars of the cosmos, apply to all things, and Time is no exception. In some places, such as this sleepy and idyllic village, they scarcely use any of the stuff. In Los Angeles, Tokyo and the City of London, where Time is Money, they burn it off at a furious rate. And, try as they might to wring every last drop of value out of each passing second, their officially allotted ration is pitifully inadequate.\n\nSceptical? Here's concrete evidence. Think how much time twenty pence buys you in a car park in Chipping Norton and the equivalent figure in Central London. Where there is supply and demand, wherever there are unfulfilled shortages, there are always entrepreneurs ready and willing to step in and sort things out. There are no exceptions to this rule. The black market in Time is probably the biggest growth area in the whole of the unofficial economy. It's also the most antisocial, which is why it's such a closely guarded secret.\n\nThe sandwiches have been eaten. Jam tarts appear. Someone produces, as if from thin air, a wind-up gramophone.\n\nSomething truly horrible is about to happen.\n\nIt works like this. Time proverbially flies when you're enjoying yourself; or, put rather more scientifically, pleasure electrolyses Time. The mere act of a human being unreservedly enjoying himself acts as a catalyst, speeding up the decay of raw Time in the atmosphere. In the same way, misery, suffering and having to go to work impede the decay of Time, causing a massive build-up of the stuff. In primitive rural communities, for example, where peasants grind out lives of bleak, hopeless toil, Time seems to stand still, until the very stones of the cottages and turf of the fields are marinaded in the stuff.\n\nTo drill for Time, therefore, find a spot where countless generations of wretched serfs have had to get up at half-past five every morning to milk bad-tempered cows. Having located the spot, shout, 'There's Time in them thar hills!' and assemble your drilling rig. This will consist of between seven and twenty happy souls who are blessed with the rare ability thoroughly to enjoy themselves, unself-consciously and without stint.\n\nResearch has shown that little old ladies on outings do this best, with thirsty male Australians coming in a close second. Combine the little old ladies with the idyllic unspoilt village and stand well back, because you've just unleashed a chain reaction that makes nuclear fission seem wimpish in comparison. And be warned; it's not a pretty sight.\n\nInside the black transit, a small machine begins to run. Someone chuckles unpleasantly, mutters, 'Time, gentlemen, please,' and throws a switch.\n\nFor the first thirty seconds, nothing much happens; nothing visible, anyway. The first perceptible changes are to the buildings. Thatch moults, dry stone walls collapse, oak beams sag. Entropy, acting as fast as the soluble aspirin of your dreams, is tearing the place apart as the surplus Time is leeched out of the fabric. Then, because Nature abhors a vacuum, raw present rushes in to take the place of the fossilised past, in the same way as a worked-out gravel pit floods with water. Thatch is replaced with tile, stone with brick and breeze-block. Barns fade away, and are replaced by barn conversions, complete with upper-middle-class occupants and a brace of Porsches in the driveway. Suddenly there's a development of ninety-six executive retirement homes in the old orchard behind the village green. A business park springs mushroom-like out of the ground where a minute ago there were only cows. Cars sprout up beside the highway like newly sown dragons' teeth. The handpumps in the public bar turn seamlessly into plastic boxes, and three racks of videos parthenogenetically appear in the window of the post office. We warned you; this is not a sight for the squeamish. It's enough to make Stephen King sleep with the light on for a week.\n\nThe old ladies don't seem to have noticed. They're exchanging photographs of their grandchildren and playing snap, while all around them the village green trembles, like the San Andreas fault having a temper tantrum, and design-and-build starter homes flip up out of the ground like poppers on a pinball table.\n\nIn the black transit, now parked in the car park of the brand new plastics factory, the little machine is buzzing like a tortured wasp. A big glass bottle, coddled and cosseted in gyroscopically mounted cradles, lead and cotton wool, slowly fills. When the meniscus reaches the twenty-centilitre mark, the operator yanks back the handle, opens the door of the van and blows a whistle. The old ladies stop what they're doing, grab their deck chairs and empty picnic baskets and make a run for the coach. Both vehicles gun their engines and race off with much spinning of wheels and burning of rubber because a village green in the process of going critical is no place to be. In fact, they've almost left it too late; just behind them the road uproots itself and contorts like a wounded python, coiling itself round a series of mini-roundabouts and branching off into a series of service roads leading to the new complex of out-of-town supermarkets. They're level with the village church when it detonates and turns itself into a drive-in leisure multiplex, and only by standing on the accelerator can the driver get the coach clear of the Jacobean manor house before it implodes and shape-changes into Kawaguchiya Integrated Circuits' south-east regional management training centre.\n\nA close shave, and the world owes a large debt of gratitude to the driver, for all that he's a myrmidon of the Time thieves' Mr Big. Because the transit van is carrying twenty centilitres of raw Time (destined to fill a lucrative order from Wall Street, which is frantically trying to make the most of the last few weeks of a Republican administration) and the thought of what would happen if that much ninety-eight-per-cent-pure stuff were to go off is enough to freeze the brain.\n\nRaw Time, spontaneously detonating in the Earth's chronological field. Historical meltdown. A Time bomb.\n\nThe man in the black transit is Chubby Stevenson, also known as The Temporiser and Mr Timeshare. Procrastination was framed; Chubby is the greatest thief of Time the world has ever seen. In his purpose-built silo, five hundred feet under the Nevada Desert, he has four hundred and sixteen litres of the stuff; enough to reprise the Renaissance and play Desert Island Decades. Do you suffer from persistent nostalgia? Do you wish it could be the Sixties all over again? Just send your order, together with a banker's draft with more noughts on it than there are portholes in the side of a trans-Atlantic liner, to Mr C. Stevenson, PO Box 666, Las Monedas, Nevada.\n\nTrying to get the petrol out of a Scorpion tank, the dragon discovered the hard way, is like breaking into a can of Coke after the little ring-pull thing has snapped off and you haven't got a tin-opener. It calls for ingenuity, patience and very robust fingernails.\n\nTwo out of three will do at a pinch; and, having slaked his thirst, the dragon relaxed, closed his eyes and considered the situation, both in the short and medium term.\n\nHe wasn't, in his opinion, excessively thin-skinned (just as well, considering the number of things that had been fired at him in the last twelve minutes) but he did get the impression that for some reason, the humans had taken against him rather. Apart from a broken claw and some light bruises the tanks hadn't bothered him very much, and the petrol was much more to his taste than all those funny drinks, but the next escalation of human disapproval would probably be aircraft, and he knew from recent observation that those things had rather more biff to them than the little self-propelled cocktail shakers. Time, he decided regretfully, to make himself inconspicuous, which would mean having to quit this exceptionally stylish and well-designed body for a while and go back into boring, silly two-legged mufti. A pity, particularly since it was now nicely fuelled-up and ready to go.\n\nHe had business here in England, but it wouldn't take long. Once that was out of the way, the world was his oyster, and there were bound to be big, flat, open spaces where a dragon could _be_ without getting shot at all the time by cultural degenerates. So, under cover, do the job, and then we're out of here. Can't, frankly, wait.\n\nHe opened his wings and, having disposed of the empties tidily by dropping them in the sea, he soared up above the clouds, giving as wide a berth as possible to any aircraft his exceptional senses detected, and circled round until he saw what he was looking for. When he saw his chance, he swooped.\n\nAt more or less the same moment as the dragon was mangling armoured fighting vehicles on the playing fields of Lancashire, someone who had been asleep for a very long time woke up.\n\nYou know what it's like when you've overslept. Head full of sawdust. Eyelids as difficult to open as painted-over windowframes. Interior of mouth tasting so repulsive you wonder who's been doing what in it while you've been sleeping. Multiply that by a couple of thousand years and maybe you get the idea.\n\n'Where,' muttered George to himself, 'the fuck am I?'\n\nA pigeon, who was sitting on his head, removed its head from its armpit and looked round. 'Who said that?' it demanded.\n\nGeorge, who could understand the language of birds, cleared his throat. 'Down here,' he said.\n\n'What, you?'\n\n'Yes, me?'\n\n'The _statue?'_\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Jeez!' The pigeon froze, kebabbed with embarrassment.\n\n'I didn't know statues could ... Look, I really am terribly sorry. I'll clean it all off, promise.'\n\n'I'm not really,' George explained, 'a statue.'\n\n'I see. You're a very big, grey person lying absolutely still. Well, it takes all sorts, I can see that, I just naturally assumed you were a statue. If you'll just bear with me I can be back with a cloth and some white spirit before you can say—'\n\n'Shut up and listen, you stupid bird. I'm inside the statue. Sort of. I'm a saint.'\n\nThe pigeon hesitated a while before replying. 'Fine,' it said. 'Where I come from we call that a non-sequitur, but never mind. Logic is for wimps, right?'\n\n'I am a saint,' George repeated, the fuel gauge on his patience edging audibly into the red. 'I appear to have reincarnated into a statue of myself. And before you ask, I have no idea why. Now then, where is this...' George looked round; a circumscribed view, since he couldn't move his head, but sufficient for his purposes '... ghastly, awful, God-forsaken place? Last thing I knew I was in open countryside.'\n\n'Birmingham,' replied the pigeon promptly. 'West Midlands metropolitan district, England, Europe. Population—'\n\n'Never heard of it.'\n\n'Really?' The pigeon sounded surprised. 'Been away long?'\n\n'Last time I looked, it was a hundred and something AD.'\n\nPigeons can't whistle. 'Strewth, mate, that's a long time. Eighteen hundred years, give or take a bit. This is ...' The pigeon counted on its feathers. 'Nineteen ninety-eight. June. Welcome back,' it added tentatively.\n\nGeorge swivelled his eyeballs. 'I sincerely hope I'm not stopping,' he replied. 'Whatever happened to grass? We used to have a lot of it in my day.'\n\nThe pigeon shuffled its wings. 'Still plenty of it about,' it replied. 'But this is the middle of a city. Did they have cities then?'\n\n'A few.' George stopped talking and winced; two thousand years' worth of pins and needles was catching up with him. 'Aaaagh,' he said.\n\n'Problem?'\n\n'My leg hurts. Go on with what you were saying.'\n\n'About Birmingham? Okay. Rated as Great Britain's second largest city, in its nineteenth-century heyday Birmingham truly merited its proud title of \"workshop of the world\". Post-war recessions and the decline of British industry in general have inevitably left their mark, but the city continues to breed a defiantly positive and dynamic mercantile—'\n\n'Pigeon.'\n\n'Yes?'\n\n'I think,' said George, 'I can now move my right arm. With it, as you may have observed, I am holding a very big sword. Unless you stop drivelling, I shall take this very big sword and shove it right up—'\n\n'All right,' replied the pigeon, offended. 'You were the one who asked. Anyway,' it added, 'that's a fine way for a saint to talk, I must say.'\n\nGeorge's eyebrows were mobile again and he frowned. 'Is it?'\n\nThe pigeon nodded. 'Sure. You're supposed to be all meek and holy and stuff.'\n\n'Bollocks.'\n\n'Straight up. I know these things. My address: The Old Blocked Gutter, West Roof, St Chad's Cathedral, Birmingham 4. I know a lot of religion,' the pigeon continued proudly, 'especially the lilies of the field and St Francis of Assisi. Saints don't eff and blind, it's the rules.'\n\n'Shows what you know,' George replied. 'Right, I'm going to move now, so I suggest you piss off and go sit somewhere else. Before you go, however, I want you to tell me where a man can get a drink around here.'\n\n'A drink,' the pigeon repeated. 'Milk?'\n\n'Don't be bloody stupid.'\n\n'Water, then?'\n\n'Booze,' George snarled. 'Alcohol. Fermented liquor.' A horrible thought struck him. 'They do still have it, don't they? Please tell me they haven't done away with it, because—'\n\n'Sure they do,' the pigeon said. 'Beer and wine and gin and stuff, makes your mob sing a lot and fall over. Saints don't drink, though. Well-known fact.'\n\n'What you know about saints,' muttered George, 'you could write on a grape pip in big letters. Just point me in the right direction and then clear off, before I use you to wipe my nose.'\n\nThe pigeon made the closest approximation it could to a disapproving tut and extended a wingtip. 'Draught Mitchell and Butlers,' it said. 'A word of warning, though.'\n\n'Well?'\n\nPigeons; Mother Nature's flying diplomatic corps. 'The sword,' it said. 'The armour. The horse. The being seven and a half feet high. Frowned upon.'\n\n'Yeah?'\n\n'Times change,' said the pigeon. 'Not to mention fashions. Can you do anything about that?'\n\n'I'm not sure.' George concentrated. 'Apparently I can. Is this better?'\n\nThe pigeon looked down. It was now sitting on the head of a short, bald man in a blue donkey jacket, jeans and scruffy trainers. 'Fine,' it said. 'How did you do that?'\n\nGeorge shrugged. 'Dunno. Who cares? When I get there, what should I ask for?'\n\n'Um.' The pigeon searched its memory - about a quarter of a byte, say a large nibble - for a phrase overheard in crisp-shrapnel-rich beer gardens. 'A pint of bitter, please, mate, and a packet of dry roasted peanuts. That usually does the trick.'\n\n'A pint of bitter, please, mate, and a packet of dry roasted peanuts.'\n\n'You've got it.'\n\n'Right. A pint of bitter, please, mate, and a packet of dry roasted peanuts. A pint of bitter, please, mate, and a packet of dry roasted peanuts. So long, birdbrain. A pint of bit ...'\n\nStanding on the empty plinth, the pigeon watched until George disappeared through the pub doorway, still rehearsing his line. It waited for a while. Then it preened itself. Then it started to peck at a cigarette butt. Two minutes or so later, the whole incident had been edited out of the active files of its mind and was held in limbo, awaiting deletion. And then ...\n\nThe pigeon looked down.\n\nIt was, once again, standing on a statue.\n\nVaguely, it recalled something it had learned recently about statues. It took another look at what it was standing on. Ah _shit,_ it said to itself.\n\n'Mike.'\n\n'Yes?'\n\n'Just come and have a look at this, will you?'\n\nInstead of folding the tarpaulin, Bianca just let it fall. Then they stood for a while and took a long, hard look.\n\n'Swings and roundabouts,' Mike said eventually. 'Snakes and ladders. Maybe even omelettes and eggs.'\n\n'What?'\n\nMike shrugged. 'I'm trying to be balanced and unhysterical,' he said. 'We now have the dragon back. True, we do seem to have lost Saint George, but...'\n\nSlowly and very tentatively, Bianca leaned forwards. She laid the palm of her hand on the dragon's cold, scaly flank. Marble. Solid, cool, bloody-awkward-to-move-about stone. 'This,' she said at last, 'is beginning to get on my nerves.'\n\n'Maybe it's a form of advanced job-sharing,' Mike suggested. 'You know, like flexi-time. I think West Midlands Council's all in favour of it, and I suppose you could just about classify these two as Council employees.'\n\n'Mike.'\n\n'Mm?'\n\n'Please go away.'\n\nAlone with her creation, Bianca thought long and hard. Sometimes she leaned against the statue, holding it. Sometimes she pressed her ear against it, as if listening. From time to time she kicked it.\n\nAfter a while, she opened her portfolio and studied some sketches and plans. She took out a tape and made some measurements, both of the statue and the surrounding area. She climbed up onto its front paws and sniffed its spectacular, gaping jaws.\n\nA mother, they say, instinctively knows what her baby is thinking. If it's in trouble, she can feel it, deep inside. Bianca frowned. No, not _trouble,_ exactly. More sort of up to something. But what?\n\nFinally, she packed up, replaced the tarpaulin and started to walk away. Having covered ten yards she turned, faced the statue, and put on her most menacing scowl.\n\n_'Sit!'_ she commanded, and stalked off down Colmore Row.\n**CHAPTER THREE**\n\n**H** aving parked his shape in Victoria Square, the dragon ambled down Colmore Row to Snow Hill and consulted the railway timetable. Three minutes later a rather bemused train pulled up (wondering, among other things, how the hell it had managed to get there from Dumfries in a hundred and eighty seconds) and he climbed aboard.\n\n'Colchester,' he said aloud.\n\nThe voice of the train, inaudible to everyone except the dragon, pointed out that the Snow Hill line doesn't go to Colchester. The dragon smiled pleasantly and invited the train to put its money where its mouth was.\n\nAlighting at Colchester, a place he had heard of but never actually been to, the dragon took a taxi to 35 Vespasian Street, explained to the driver and climbed the stairs.\n\nThe top floor of 35 Vespasian Street is given over to a suite of offices consisting of a chair, a desk, a computer terminal, an electric kettle, an anomaly in the telephone network and seven hundred and forty-three filing cabinets. The door says:\n\nL. KORTRIGHT ASSOCIATES  \nSUPERNATURAL AGENCY\n\nLin Kortright was on the anomaly when the dragon walked in. He was explaining to Horus, the Egyptian charioteer of the Sun, that simply picking it up, moving it along in a straight line and putting it down again without dropping it was no longer good enough to guarantee him full employment, and had he considered, for example, juggling with it or balancing it on a stick while riding a unicycle. As the door opened he didn't look up, merely made a go-away gesture. He was about to suggest training it to do simple tricks when he noticed that the receiver was back on its cradle and he was, in fact, talking to the palm of his hand. He raised his eyes, impressed.\n\n'Hey,' he said, 'how'd you do that?'\n\n'Do what?'\n\n'It's purely instinctive with you, huh? No matter. What can I do for you?'\n\n'I'm looking,' the dragon replied, sitting on a chair last seen two seconds previously under an actuary in Stroud and still warm, 'for a job. I imagine you might be able to help.'\n\nMr Kortright studied the chair for a while, and then nodded. 'Possibly, possibly,' he said. 'What d'you do?'\n\n'What needs doing?'\n\nMr Kortright frowned. 'No, no, no,' he said, 'that's not the way it works. You gotta have an act before you come bothering me. Let's see. You can do telekinesis, right?'\n\n'Can I?'\n\n'Oh boy, a natural,' Mr Kortright sighed, rather as Saint Sebastian would have done if, just as the last arrow thudded home in his ribcage, he also remembered he'd left home without switching off the oven. 'Don't get me wrong,' he added, 'maybe I can still find you something, if you don't mind touring. Done any poltergeisting?'\n\nThe dragon's brow furrowed in thought until he looked like a fight between two privet hedges. Ever since he'd come back, he'd been letting his subconscious fill in as many of the gaps as possible, mostly by opening a direct line from his exceptional ears to his memory. In consequence, the back lots of his brain were stuffed with thousands of unprocessed eavesdroppings, waiting to be filtered and condensed into usable ready-to-wear background information. 'Poltergeists,' he mused, accessing a fragment of a documentary overheard when the taxi drove within a mile of a TV showroom. 'That's a ghost or similar evil spirit who throws things, yes?'\n\n'Yup.'\n\n'No. Sorry.'\n\nMr Kortright's shoulders rose and fell like share prices during a closely contested election. 'Okay,' he said. 'You wanna learn?'\n\n'Not really, no. All seems a bit gratuitous if you ask me. And besides, I don't plan on being here very long, so there's little point learning new skills.'\n\n'Picky, huh? You got a nerve.'\n\n'Several,' replied the dragon, absently. 'In this body, anyway. The other one's just animated rock.'\n\nIt took Mr Kortright's brain three quarters of a second to pick up on the words _this body and the other one,_ speculate on the significance and dismiss the whole as too much hassle. 'So what did you used to do? Have an act then?'\n\nThe dragon nodded. 'I flew about breathing fire, making rain, that style of thing.'\n\n'Dragon, huh?'\n\n'You're very perceptive.'\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation Mr Kortright correctly interpreted the dragon's remark as a compliment. 'Not much around at the moment for dragons,' he said. 'Endangered species regulations,' he added.\n\n'Ah.' This seemed to confirm what the dragon had assumed about a national dragon shortage. 'So dragons are protected, are they?'\n\nMr Kortright grinned. 'Dragons?' he said. 'No way. Nothing in the legislation about dragons. Now crocodiles, yes. Which means the supply of raw material for the handbag trade is down to last knockings. But if you're good you can make dragon _look_ like crocodile ... You get my meaning?'\n\nA corner of the dragon's mouth twitched. 'I seem to remember you people have a saying,' he said. 'First catch your...'\n\n'Been away a long time, have you?' The Kortright grin widened, until it looked like the aftermath of seismic activity. 'In which case, here's a tip for you. If you're flying along and you see something long and grey and kind of tube shaped with little fins coming straight at you, don't try chatting it up or asking it out to the movies. They call them wire-guided missiles, and—'\n\n'Yes, thanks,' said the dragon. 'I found out about those for myself. So there are still dragons about, then? People seem to react as if I'm extinct or something.'\n\n'In these parts,' Mr Kortright explained, 'you are. In this century, in fact. That doesn't worry transtemporal poachers any; just means that by the time they market the goods, they're also genuine antiques and therefore legal to sell.'\n\n'Ah.' The dragon shrugged. 'But so long as I'm now, I'm relatively safe?'\n\n'Safe.' Mr Kortright savoured the word. 'From poachers, maybe. I mean, chances are, if you stick around any year with nineteen on the front of it, you won't suddenly find yourself full of powder compacts with a zip up your back. There are,' he added, 'other dangers.'\n\n'Thought that might be the case,' the dragon replied. 'Which is precisely why I'm in plain clothes and looking for a job. You see, I have things to do in the here and now. Once they're done, I'm off somewhere and when a bit less paranoid. While I'm here, though, I thought a job'd help pass the time and help me blend in.'\n\n'Very wise. So,' Mr Kortright went on, steepling his fingers, 'where are we at? Ex-dragon. Ex-dragon. Now then, let me see.'\n\nThe dragon waited patiently while Mr Kortright played with his computer.\n\n'Any luck?'\n\nMr Kortright pursed his lips. 'Well,' he said, 'like I say to all the kids just starting out in the business, when you're trying to make your way, sometimes you've gotta do things you'd rather not. You sure about poltergeisting?'\n\n'Positive.'\n\n'Shucks. Hey, what's this?' He peered at the screen. 'I can get you six weeks' volcanic activity in Hawaii, covering for the local fire-god while he takes his kids to Disneyland. All you gotta do is lie on your back and blow up through a small hole.'\n\n'Sorry. Got to be in this country. Anyway, where's Hawaii?'\n\n'Please yourself. Gonna be difficult, though. How do you feel about hallucinations?'\n\n'I beg your pardon?'\n\n'Hallucinations. For health-conscious druggies. All the weird visions without actually taking the drug. Growth area, steady work.'\n\n'Not really me, somehow. I'd feel self-conscious. Besides, don't you have to be a pink elephant?'\n\n'Boy, are you behind the times.' Mr Kortright frowned, and tapped a few more keys. 'Okay, okay, you're gonna love this. This is really so _you._ Security guard.'\n\n'Security guard?'\n\n'It says here, _traditional_ security guard needed for substantial art collection. Full board. The successful applicant will be at least fourteen feet long, green and covered in scales. No time wasters. There now, what can I say?'\n\n'Okay,' said the dragon. 'When can I start?'\n\nGeorge sailed through the air in a graceful arc and landed in a dustbin. Behind him came a voice, warmly recommending that he stay out. After a short pause for regrouping, he climbed out, brushed trash off his person and staggered away down the alley.\n\nSeems like old times, he said to himself, getting slung out of drinking establishments. Some things had changed, of course; for one thing, getting slung out was now a whole lot easier. Definitely a regrettable tendency to over-react.\n\nHis mind drifted back to the bars of his youth. Pendle's, the roughest saints' bar in Albion. The Caerllyr Grill. The Grendel's Torso. What the hell was wrong with this goddamn country?\n\nHalf an hour's slouching, lurching and bumping into things brought him back to Victoria Square, and he realised that he didn't have anywhere to sleep for the night. He saw...\n\n'Immediately,' said Mr Kortright. 'Here's the address. Do well.'\n\nThe dragon trotted down the stairs into the street and whistled. A moment later, a huge green shape, flying faster than the wind, descended on him and he vanished.\n\n... An empty plinth. He thought of his nice warm statue; good, solid marble that didn't wobble about all over the place like this blasted cheapskate flesh-and-blood outfit did. Climbing the plinth, he sighed, closed his eyes and was stone once more.\n\n'I'm not saying,' said Chubby Stevenson, his brain racing, 'it's impossible. Nothing's _impossible._ All I'm saying is, it's going to be tricky.'\n\nFifteen impassive Japanese faces regarded him, until he began to feel like asking for his blindfold and last cigarette. These people, he realised, don't want to hear this. Pity.\n\n'It's all to do,' he continued, cramming charm into the meter of his smile, 'with the fundamental nature of Time. Now, with my supplies of raw Time, I can prolong the present, no problem. In certain circumstances, I can sometimes recreate the past - not travel back in time, now that is impossible. Nobody can do that. What I sometimes do, for specially favoured customers, is make a synthetic recreation of a specific episode from the past, using a raw Time base and...'\n\nThey weren't interested. He wasn't answering the question they'd asked him. Jesus, these guys!\n\n'The future,' he therefore said, 'is something else entirely. Future's different from past and present, see. Future hasn't happened yet. If it hasn't happened, we don't know what it's like. If you don't know what it's like, you can't copy it. Now...'\n\nOne of the fifteen leaned forward and, terribly politely, cleared his throat. With respect, his expression said - his lips didn't move and he didn't make a noise, but there was no need, just as you don't need to speak fluent Gun to know that when a .44 revolver stares at you with its one big eye it's informing you that you are probably going to die - they knew this already. What they didn't know, and what they wanted him to tell them, was whether it was possible to arrange an artificial future, in which certain specified events would happen; and if so, how much would it cost? If he didn't know the answer, the expression continued, then perhaps he would be good enough to say so.\n\nChubby sighed, and got a grip on himself. 'It can be done,' he said. 'The principle is quite straightforward; simple, even. The practicalities ...'\n\nPlease explain the practicalities.\n\n'Okay. It's all relativity, right? Travel faster than light around the Earth to accelerate forward through Time. Once you're there, or do I mean then, you set up whatever it is you want to happen in the future. Like, you want to bet heavily on the Superbowl, you fast forward to the day of the match, see who . wins, now you can place your bet - provided you can get back to your own time, or get a message back, anyhow; obviously, you can't get back yourself, because pastside travel's out, see above. Sending a message, though, that's no problem.'\n\nReally?\n\n'Trade secret,' Chubby said. Normally he'd have winked as well, but there was something about the wall of stone-faced scrutiny opposite him that put him off the idea. 'We can do it, anyhow. The technical problem, of course, is finding your faster-than-light courier.'\n\nA soluble problem?\n\n'I feel sure we can sort it out,' Chubby lied. 'Of course, if we knew we'd be successful, we'd just get the courier to report back from the future on how we'd managed it, the same time as he passes back the Superbowl results; but that's a bit hit-and-miss so far as I'm concerned. Sloppy, you know?'\n\nIndeed the fifteen did. Sloppiness, the expression gave him to understand, was anathema to them. Chubby painted a smile over the cracks in his composure and continued. 'So,' he said, 'you boys are going to have to let our R & D people kick this one around for a day or two. As soon as we've got the ans-'\n\nYou will report back to us in forty-eight hours? Very well.\n\nChubby's Adam's apple bobbed like a Formula One lift. 'When I said a day or two, I didn't actually mean two days, I meant '\n\nYou are already suggesting a postponement. Seventy-two hours, then.\n\n'How would it be,' Chubby croaked, 'if we call you when we're ready to roll? We'll be as quick as we can, naturally.'\n\nYou are asking for an indefinite postponement while you attempt to find a way to do this?\n\n'Yes.'\n\nWe would prefer, said fifteen expressions simultaneously, a specified time limit. That is the way we do business. We trust you can accommodate us on this point.\n\n'Just give me a week, will you?' Chubby's tone suggested that he was Faust offering the Devil double or quits, and even as he spoke a small, rather naive part of his brain demanded Why are you so scared of these guys? 'By then, I'll have definite plans, costings, all that kind of stuff ready for you to see. Agreed?'\n\nLong pause. It was like the moment of thoughtful hesitation on the Seventh Day just before Man, having been assured by God that it was a nice little runner, genuine low mileage, normally you only get oceans of this quality on the top-of-the-range models, said, Okay, we'll take it. Then fifteen heads nodded. A moment later, the conference room was empty, and a helicopter engine started up somewhere on the roof.\n\n'Hooray,' said Chubby wretchedly to himself. 'I guess I've landed this really big contract.'\n\nIt was a dirty, rotten job ...\n\n_Plink!_ A tiny globe of lime-rich water dripped from cavern roof to floor.\n\n... But someone's got to do it. Apparently. Ouch! Jesus, but this stuffs _uncomfortable._\n\nTraditional security guard, substantial art collection. Whoever drafted that advertisement had probably spent some time in the estate agency business, learning in the process the art of making statements that are almost but not quite downright untrue.\n\nThe art collection was housed in a cave two hundred feet below the Pennine Hills and consisted of about three hundred tons' weight of gold tableware; very old, very vulgar and extremely unpleasant to lie on. Cold. Hard. Lots of handles and knobs and scutcheons to dig into you.\n\nPlus, of course, the alluring prospect of being woken up just as soon as you've dropped off by some amateur hero with weapons, desperate courage and a fleet of lorries outside the cave mouth with their engines running. It was as bad as being a guard dog, and he didn't even have a little bowl with his name on it. The job, the dragon decided, sucks.\n\n'Hello?'\n\nThe voice was still some way off; high-pitched, almost feminine. A ploy, thought the dragon, and a piss-poor one at that. Pound to a penny it's some muscular git in tin overalls making his voice sound funny to put me off my guard. He breathed in, savouring the mellow warmth of his own breath.\n\n'Anybody home?'\n\nOnly one way he can come and that's straight through that hole there. Just let him poke his head through, and his mates'll have to carry him home in an asbestos bag.\n\n'Here you are.' The head, as he'd predicted, appeared. But it was female. There was no helmet, no nodding white plume. The dragon was so surprised he swallowed his breath and got hiccups. Nasty ...\n\n'Are you,' said the female, 'Mr Wayne Popper?'\n\nThe dragon looked at her.\n\n'My name,' she went on, 'is Marjorie Evans. Inland Revenue.'\n\nA tiny flare of green fire spurted from the dragon's right ear, evidence of the rather complex and horrible ear-nose-and-throat difficulties he was currently experiencing. 'Is that so?' he croaked. 'Look, I do have a certain discretion in these matters, so I'm going to count up to five and then - Oops, ah, shit, do excuse me, please.' For a few moments, the darkness of the cavern was illuminated by the sort of firework display you generally only get to see when there's an important Royal wedding.\n\n'Bless you,' said Miss Evans, instinctively fumbling in her bag for a tissue. 'Sorry, you did say you are Mr Popper?'\n\n'I didn't say anything,' replied the dragon, confused. 'Now get the hell out of here, before I incinerate you.'\n\n'I'll take that,' replied Miss Evans briskly, 'as a Yes.' She straightened her back, took out a notebook and looked around, miming seeing the gold for the first time. 'Well then,' she said. 'What have we here?'\n\nInside the dragon's brain, a debate was raging. The traditionalists were saying, You fool, here's a blasted hero, well, all right, heroine, come to nick the goodies, so why the hell don't you just torch her PDQ and have done with it? In another part of his brain, his loyal opposition was arguing that actually she'd given no indication that she was here to steal anything, she wasn't armed, she'd even offered a tissue when he sneezed. So what? retorted the traditionalists. So I don't want to carbonise her, replied the opposition. She hasn't done me any harm. Chicken, taunted the old guard. No, replied the other lot, dragon; same number of wings, but bigger and twice the legs.\n\n'It's a pile of gold,' replied the dragon, in the meantime.\n\n'Is it really?' Miss Evans was writing in the book. 'Could you possibly explain to me how you came by it?'\n\n'Um,' said the dragon. 'I'm, er, looking after it for somebody else.'\n\nAs the woman looked at him, non-aggressive, pacific, even smiling slightly in a mildly cynical way through thick-lensed spectacles, the dragon was aware of a feeling he hadn't had for so long he could only just put a name to it. It disconcerted him, no end.\n\nHe felt like he was in trouble.\n\n'Really,' said the woman. 'And might I ask who this other person might be?'\n\nThis, said the ruling majority in the dragon's brain, is crazy. One little puff and she's ash. No sword. No armour. And it isn't even my treasure. So why do I feel as if I've just been caught with my talon in the biscuit tin?\n\n'A friend,' the dragon mumbled, not sure where the words he was saying were coming from. 'Or rather, a bloke I met in a pub, didn't catch his name. Just look after this lot for me, he said, won't be a tick.'\n\n'I see.'\n\nThat was all she said. I see. In the old days, when the dragon took to the air, the roads leading in the opposite direction were clogged with nose-to-tail handcarts. He hiccupped again. 'Gesundheit,' said the woman.\n\n'Um,' said the dragon, his vocal chords sandpaper. 'Is there a problem?'\n\nThe woman closed her notebook, clicked her biro and put them both away. 'Mr Popper,' she said, 'let me be frank with you. I have to say I'm not really very happy with your story I don't have to tell you, defrauding the Revenue is no laughing matter.'\n\nFor some reason he couldn't account for at all - the unfamiliarity of the concept, perhaps, or the bewildering lack of terror on the woman's part - the last three words she'd spoken were perhaps the most unnerving things he'd ever heard a mortal say. When you consider that they were _competing against such strong contenders as Take your ten thousand archers round the back of the hill, we'll attack from here with our twenty thousand cavalry and If he had any idea what we'djtist put in there, he wouldn't be drinking it, maybe_ you can get a vague glimpse at the dragon's complete bewilderment.\n\n'Allright,' he said. 'I'm not Mr Popper. I just work for him.'\n\nThe woman smiled. It was, actually, quite a pleasant smile. In her spare time, she probably made fur-fabric mouse bookmarks. 'I had already guessed that, Mr ...'\n\n'Dragon.'\n\n'Mister Dragon.' She pulled out the notebook again. 'But there is such a thing as being an accessory, you know. I really would urge you to co-operate with us.'\n\n'Sure.' A minor seismic event, last echo of the hiccups, ,wafted blue flame out of the dragon's left ear; if only, snarled his subconscious, I could accidentally sneeze at her, all they'd ever find would be charcoal. And I wouldn't even have done it on purpose.\n\nBut no sneeze came, and the dragon had to suffer the indignity of listening to himself telling the woman everything he knew about the job - Mr Popper's enormous property deals, payments made in gold for, what had he called it, fiscal convenience, all kinds of things he scarcely understood himself - while she wrote carefully, nodded and mhm'd, then closed her notebook, thanked him very politely and left the way she'd come.\n\nA moment after that, he inflated both lungs and blew the biggest flare of extra-hot red fire he'd ever managed in his life. It melted the walls of the cavern, but it didn't reach Miss Evans; he could hear her inch-and-a-half heels still clippety-clopping along the winding tunnel. Thanks to his belated efforts, however, the hole in the wall was now almost sealed off and he couldn't get through to press home the attack.\n\n'Shit!' he roared. _'What's happening to me?'_\n\nNobody said anything, but his deranged imagination made him believe that, in the dying echoes of his own roar, he heard a mocking voice asking him whose side he was on.\n\n'Quite soon,' Bianca said, 'I shall have had enough of this.'\n\n'I think you ought to tell someone,' Mike replied, calmly folding the tarpaulin which, removed a moment or so ago, had revealed Saint George returned and the dragon gone. 'There's two possible explanations, and one of them demands that we believe in the existence of a practical joker with access to helicopters and heavy lifting gear, who's capable of swapping enormously heavy statues round in the centre of Birmingham at dead of night without anybody noticing.'\n\n'That's absurd.'\n\n'Obviously. Therefore,' Mike continued, 'we're dealing with the boring old supernatural. You've got to tell someone, otherwise it'll invalidate your insurance.'\n\nBianca scowled. 'That's absurd too,' she said.\n\n'Tell you something else that's absurd, while I'm at it,' Mike responded, shoving the folded tarpaulin into a cardboard box, 'and that's bloody great statues playing hide and seek with themselves in a public place.'\n\n'We can't tell anyone,' Bianca objected. 'They'd never believe us. They'd lock us up in the nut house.'\n\n'Maybe.' Mike shrugged. 'At least then, this'd be someone else's problem. Right now, I could fancy somewhere dark and cool with bendy wallpaper.'\n\nBianca was silent for a moment, then she started to rummage in her toolbag. 'I know one thing I _am_ going to do,' she said.\n\n'Oh yes?'\n\n'I'm going to chip off that ridiculous moustache.'\n\nDismissed without references for gross breach of confidentiality, the dragon swished its tail dispiritedly and flew east.\n\nEn route it had a run-in with three F-llls, hastily scrambled by a gibbering controller out of Brize Norton and armed with everything Father Christmas had left in the RAF's stocking for the last six years.\n\nIn due course the pilots ejected and, save for a broken leg and some bruises, landed safely. Most of the bits of aeroplane came down in the sea. Which, the dragon mused as it continued its flight, only makes the business with the tax woman all the more disturbing.\n\n'Guy,' said Mr Kortright, having heard the tale, 'believe me, you were right to trust your instincts. You just don't tangle with those people, not ever. Shame about the job, but you did right. Besides,' he added with a shrug, 'there's the morality of the thing to consider. The forces of Evil gotta stick together, right?'\n\n'I beg your pardon?'\n\nMr Kortright gave him a puzzled look. 'Evil,' he said. 'Your team. You represent the forces of darkness, and so do they. You go welshing on your own kind, you'll never work in this business again.'\n\nFrom Colchester - Mr Kortright promised him faithfully to let him know as soon as anything suitable came up - he flew fast and high to the Midlands, found his plinth and parked. Getting out of the cavern had used up most of his fuel supply, and dealing with the aircraft had polished off the rest. He was tired, and upset, and he needed a rest.\n\nEvil? What did the little creep mean, Evil?\n\nGeorge woke up.\n\nDeep down in the very marrow of the stone, his head hurt. He felt sick. What, he asked himself, would come up if I was? Probably gravel.\n\nThere was something underneath him. Slowly - moving his head was a wild, scary thing to do, comparable to setting off in three small boats to find the back way to India - he looked down. He looked up again, rather more quickly.\n\nOh God, he said to himself. Please let me be hallucinating.\n\nA tentative prod with a toe persuaded him otherwise. Horribly solid. Sphincter-looseningly real. And I'm directly above it!\n\nHe waited. When the dragon didn't make a move, he risked breathing. Still no reaction. With extreme diffidence he reached down and prodded with the point of his sword. Chink. Nothing. It was only a statue, nothing more.\n\nFuck that, George reflected, so'm I. And people who live in marble overcoats shouldn't prod dragons.\n\nHe waited a little longer, each second dragging by like a double geography lesson. He wasn't at all sure that he understood how this statue business worked, but either the dragon simply wasn't at home, or it was waiting for him to make a move. In the latter case, staying put was simply prolonging the inevitable. He braced himself, took a deep breath and jumped.\n\nThe ground rushed up to meet him like a long-lost creditor; he landed, swore and rolled. His head protested in the strongest possible terms. The dragon didn't move. He stood up.\n\n'Gotcha!'\n\nHe had now, of course, shed the marble and was back in a conventional human skin; but not for very long, because Bianca's voice and the slap of her hand on his shoulder made him jump out of it. He said 'Eeek!' and turned white, all in an impressively short space of time.\n\n'And where the hell do you think you're going?'\n\nHis brain reported back off sick leave and mentioned to him that the creature holding his arm was not a dragon so much as a defenceless girl. That's all right, then. He put the palm of his hand in her face and shoved. Then he ran.\n\nA moment later he was lying on his nose; a state of affairs he was able to trace back to someone grabbing hold of his feet. 'Gerroff!' he screeched. 'There's a bastard dragon after-'\n\nThen Bianca hit him on the head with a two-pound mallet.\n**CHAPTER FOUR**\n\n**'M** aybe,' said a guest, 'they're being thrown out for antisocial behaviour.'\n\nHe was looking at a long, scruffy coach, state of the art passenger transport from around the time Bobby Charlton was England's leading goal-scorer, which was spluttering patiently in bay 3a of the bus station in Hell.\n\n'Quite possibly,' replied a fellow guest, who happened to be on his tea break. 'Look what they're wearing.'\n\nThe first guest, also on his tea break, peered. 'Yes,' he said, 'I see what you mean.'\n\nAs a matter of fact, these two guests were always on their tea break. In life they'd been builders, and the cruel and unusual punishment reserved for them in the afterlife was that they'd be allowed out as soon as they'd had a quick brew; two thousand years of frantic slurping later, the meniscus on their cups was, if anything, half a millimetre higher up the china than it had been when they arrived.\n\nEverybody, no matter how depraved or evil they may be, is entitled to a holiday, and the first three weeks in August are traditionally the time when the staff of Hell, your cosy, centrally heated home from home under the ground, get to pack their suitcases, dig out their plastic buckets and pitchforks from the cupboard under the stairs, put on silly hats and get away from it all. They choose August because - well, you know what the beach is like then. They feel more at home that way.\n\n'If so,' observed the second guest, 'I reckon we've had a lucky escape.'\n\nHis colleague nodded vigorously, his eyes fixed on the white denims, broad-brimmed hats, synthetic buckskin fringes and spangled waistcoats of the party boarding the coach. Not, of course, that either of them had anything against country music as such; in its place, they'd be the first to declare, it was all very fine and splendid. Except, of course, its place was - most definitely - here. So far, the Management hadn't twigged this. When they eventually did, they'd be able to maintain the same uniquely high standard of torment (BS 199645; always look for the kitemark) while saving themselves a fortune on pitchforks and firewood.\n\nHad the guests been a few yards closer to bay 3a, they'd have been able to read the poster prominently displayed in the coach's back window. It read:\n\n **HELL HOLDINGS PLC  \nSTAFF COUNTRY & WESTERN CLUB  \nANNUAL OUTING**\n\n_Nashville Or Bust!_\n\n'Okay,' George said. 'It's like this.'\n\n'Just a minute,' Bianca interrupted, switching on the pocket dictating machine. 'I want this on tape.'\n\nGeorge looked at her. 'What's that little box thing you're playing around with?' he said. 'Look, there's no need to get nasty.'\n\nBianca explained, as briefly as she could, about tape recorders. Perhaps she didn't express herself very well because George made a couple of high-pitched noises and renewed his pointless struggle with the stout ropes that attached him to Earth Mother _VI,_ the most solid piece of statuary in Bianca's studio. Playing back the tape just seemed to make things worse. She sighed and slipped it back in her pocket.\n\n'You were saying,' she said.\n\nOnce upon a time (George explained), long ago and far away, in a remote land called Albion, there was a dragon.\n\nIn fact, there were a lot of dragons. And that wasn't a problem for the people who lived there, because they'd long since based their entire economy on dragons; they ate dragon, wore dragonskin, used the wing membrane to make their tents and burned the bones for warmth. And, since there were more than enough dragons to spare - great herds of them roamed the empty moors, grazing placidly and from time to time accidentally setting fire to hundreds of thousands of acres - there was no reason why the system shouldn't work for ever.\n\nThat, however, was before the coming of the white men and the iron horse.\n\nAncient Albion called them the white men because they wore white surcoats over their armour; and the horses weren't actually made of iron, they were just covered with the stuff to protect them from arrows. The newcomers were knights, followers of the code of chivalry, searchers for the Holy Grail. They'd been slung out of their own countries for being an insufferable nuisance and had headed west.\n\nWhen they arrived in Albion they decided it would do nicely and they set about getting vacant possession. The natives, however, were no pushover and the white men were getting nowhere fast when one of their leaders hit on a sensible, if drastic, course of action.\n\nThe natives, he argued, live off the dragons. Get rid of the dragons and you get rid of the natives.\n\nOf those wild, exciting frontier days many stirring tales are told; many of them about the greatest dragon-hunter of them all, Dragon George Cody, who singlehandedly cleared all of what is now Northern England, Wales and Scotland of dragons. He it was who first justified the clearances by saying that the knights stood for good and the dragons stood for evil, and, in his own terms, he was right. The knights were, after all, soldiers of the Church, ultimately searching for the Grail, and the dragons were getting in the way and, by deviously getting killed and eaten by the locals, giving aid and comfort to the hostile tribesmen. Besides, George pointed out, dragons burn towns and demand princesses as ransom.\n\nThe dragons, referring to the Siege of Jerusalem, the Sack of Constantinople and a thousand years of dynastic marriages, said, Look who's talking. But rarely twice.\n\nAnd then there was only one dragon left; the biggest and fiercest of them all, twice the size and three times the firepower of anything the knights had come up against. He had seen his race eradicated, the corpses of his kin heaped up beside the white men's newly built roads and carted off to Camelot Fried Dragon bars the length and breadth of Albion. He had also learned that he and his kind were the Bad Guys, which puzzled him quite a bit initially but eventually came to make some sort of sense. After all, if dragons were the Good Guys, then these people wouldn't have gone to so much trouble to wipe them out. Would they?\n\nWell, said the dragon to himself. If the cap fits, and so forth.\n\nIn the event, wearing the cap was _fun._\n\n'I see,' Bianca said. 'So that's why you weren't particularly keen to meet the dragon. Figures.'\n\n'It had to be done,' George growled defensively. 'Out of that rough and ready cradle, a mighty nation sprang to life. Civilisations, like grapevines, grow best when mulched with blood. You can't make an omelette ...'\n\nBianca's brow furrowed. 'You've made your point,' she said. 'But you haven't explained what you're doing in my statue. Or,' she added savagely, 'why you keep moving the blasted thing about.'\n\n'I'm coming to that.' George paused and licked his lips. 'All this explaining,' he went on, 'isn't half making me thirsty. You couldn't just give us a glass of water, could you?'\n\nBianca nodded silently and went to the kitchen. As soon as her back was turned, George, who had been quietly fraying the ropes against an aesthetically necessary sharp edge on the statue's shin, gave a sharp tug.\n\nOf Sir Galahad it is told that his strength was as the strength of ten because his heart was pure. George's heart had approximately the same purity quotient as a pint of Thames water, but he did press-ups instead. The rope snapped.\n\n'Hey!' Bianca dropped the glass and came running, but George was already on his feet and heading for the door. When she tried to stop him, he nutted her with a plaster-of-Paris study for Truth _Inspiring_ The _Telecommunications Industry,_ clattered down the stairs and legged it.\n\n'Finally,' said the Demon Chardonay (ironic cheers and cries of 'Good!') 'let's all remember, this is a _holiday._ We're supposed to be _enjoying ourselves._ Okay?'\n\nAt that moment the coach rolled over a pothole, jolting it so forcefully that Chardonay, who was standing up, nutted himself on the roof, thereby demonstrating to his fellow passengers that, even in Hell, there is justice.\n\n'Pillock,' muttered the Demon Prodsnap under his breath. 'What'd he have to come for, anyway?'\n\nOn his left the Demon Slitgrind grunted agreement. 'I think Management shouldn't be allowed on outings,' he said. 'Ruins it for the rest of us. I mean, fat chance we've got of having a good time with one of them miserable buggers breathing down our necks. If I'd known I wouldn't have bothered coming.'\n\nAlthough in his heart Prodsnap reciprocated these sentiments, he was beginning to wish he hadn't raised the subject, because if one thing could be guaranteed to lay a big fat oilslick over the whole weekend, it would have to be listening to Slitgrind's opinions.\n\n'I mean to say,' Slitgrind went on, 'least they could do would be to have different coaches for Management and us, bloody cheapskates. Wouldn't be surprised if they'd done it deliberately, just to spoil it.'\n\nThere are, appropriately, more opinions in Hell than anywhere else in the cosmos; and most of them, sooner or later, belonged to Slitgrind. Innumerable and diverse - contradictory even - though they were, in the long run they eventually boiled down into a single, multi-purpose, one-size-fits-all opinion; namely that the Universe was an upside-down pyramid of horseshit, with Slitgrind pinned down under the apex.\n\n'Oh well,' replied Prodsnap, trying to sound positive (it came as easily to him as smiling to a bomb, but he did his best), 'never mind. Still better than work, though, isn't it?'\n\n'Depends,' Slitgrind said. 'I mean, with frigging Management along, don't suppose it'll be any different from work. Wouldn't be at all surprised if...'\n\nOh yes, muttered Prodsnap's soul, it'll be different from work all right. At work, I torture other people. 'Oh look,' he said, pointing out of the window. 'I can see a cow.'\n\n'That's not a cow, you daft git, that's a bull-headed fiend goring impenitent usurers. That's another thing, they get uniform allowance, but we ...'\n\nProdsnap closed his eyes. Another difference, he noted; the guests have all done something to deserve it. What did I ever do, for crying out loud?\n\nAt the front of the coach Chardonay, knees smothered in maps, tickets, bits of miscellaneous paper and other props on loan from the Travel Agents' Department, had dropped his red ball-point. This was bad news; he was using the red pen to mark emergency itinerary B (second fallback option in the event of missing the Styx ferry and the 11.35 helicopter service to Limbo Central) on contingency map 2. Scrabbling for it under the seats, he found himself inadvertently brushing against the slender, hairy ankles of the Demon Snorkfrod. Embarrassing.\n\n'Oh,' he said, blushing bright grey. 'Sorry.'\n\nNot that there were many shapelier hooves in all the Nine Circles. One-time Helliday Inn cocktail waitress, former centrefold in the Tibetan Book of the Dead, twice Playghoul of the Month in _Hell and Efficiency_ magazine, Snorkfrod was just the sort of ghastly apparition any green-blooded demon would want to' see jumping out of a coffin at his birthday party. It was just... Well, whenever he saw her, the phrase 'rough as guts' did inevitably spring to Chardonay's mind. And (not that he'd had an infinity of experience in these matters) the way she stared at him sometimes was ...\n\n'Hello,' Snorkfrod replied, looking down and smiling like a crescent-shaped escalator. 'Lost something?'\n\n'My red biro.'\n\n'Don't think you'll find it there, pet. But you're welcome to look.'\n\nAfter a split second's thought, Chardonay decided the safest course would be to say nothing at all and get the Shopfloor out of there as quickly as possible. Which he did.\n\nRecovering his seat - as he sat down, he heard something go snap under his left hoof; no point even bothering to look - Chardonay reflected, not for the first time, that maybe he wasn't really best suited in this line of work, or indeed this whole sector. It was, he knew, a viewpoint shared by many.\n\nThe polite term, he understood, was _upsiders;_ talented high-fliers headhunted (so to speak) from outside at the time of the Management buy-out; new brooms; fresh pairs, or trios, of eyes. As an experiment it hadn't entirely worked. True, it had shaken things up; the bad old days of jobs for the fiends and living men's hooves were gone for ever, and next year there was a one in three chance they'd get the balance sheet to live up to its name for the first time ever. On the other hand, the inertia of any really huge corporation is so great that it takes more than a few college kids with stars in their eyes and Gucci designer horns to change anything that really matters. And as far as he personally was concerned - well, he never thought he'd ever hear himself saying this - maybe law school would have been a better bet after all.\n\nNevertheless, here he was, and giving anything less than his best shot was unthinkable. The one area he knew he could improve matters was in industrial relations, which was why he was here. Either that, or he'd had a _really_ wild time in a former life and put it, as it were, on his Access card.\n\nSuddenly he was uncomfortably aware that he was being looked at. Somewhere in the fourth row something sniggered. Stray phrases _like he's well in there and after hours in_ the stationery cupboard were scurrying about in the thick atmosphere of the bus like mice in a derelict cheese warehouse. A huge, bald demon in row five caught his eye, winked and made a very peculiar gesture with three claws and an elbow. All in all, Chardonay reckoned, he was rapidly inclining towards the Past Life theory; in which case, it was bitterly unfair that he couldn't even remember what it was he'd got up to.\n\nBy his calculations it was ninety-six hours from Hell to Nashville and so far they'd been on the road for twenty minutes. And, like he'd said, this was fun. Having sketched out a course of entertainment for the inventor of the concept of fun that would have seriously impressed his superiors, Chardonay squirmed rootlike into his seat, scrabbled himself a makeshift cocoon of papers and settled down to enjoy his holiday.\n\nA flask of coffee, a ham and lettuce sandwich, a camera, the latest Ruth Rendell, a folding stool, a baseball bat - and thou.\n\nThou in this instance being a big marble statue of a dragon. This time, Bianca had vowed, if the sucker moves so much as a millimetre, I'll have him. It's just a question of staying awake and being patient.\n\nAs for Saint George, she reflected as she scattered crumbs among the pigeons, best to suspend disbelief, on full pay, at least until she saw what happened with the other statue. Once she'd had an opportunity to examine the evidence she'd gathered so far in the light of what she could learn from Mr Scaly over there, she could make a fully informed, rational choice between the two alternative explanations. And, if the vote eventually went the way of a big, peaceful house in the country and clothes with the sleeves laced up the back, then at least she'd have the altruistic satisfaction of knowing that she, not the entire galaxy, had suddenly gone barking mad.\n\nShe'd just got to the bit in her book where the second spanner turns up in the glove compartment of the original suspect's Reliant Robin when a tiny spasm of movement caught her eye. A tiny flick of the tail? She wasn't sure. So, though her heart was pinging away like a sewing machine and some funny bastard had apparently put gelatine in her breath, she stayed as still as rush-hour traffic and waited.\n\nThe next time, it was an eyelid. Then a little twitch of a nostril. That settled it; the blasted thing was asleep.\n\nShe stood up, packed up her things, folded the stool and gripped the baseball bat. It broke after the fourth blow, but didn't die in vain.\n\n'Urg,' said the dragon. 'Wassamatter?'\n\n'Wake up!'\n\n'Is it that time already?' The dragon opened both eyes. He could see a young human female standing beside him, her head level with his eye. In her hand, a broken club. Did she look somehow familiar?\n\nProbably not. Over the years he'd come across a fair number of similar specimens, but that was all a very long time ago now; and besides, the very circumstances under which he tended to meet princesses made it highly improbable that he'd ever meet the same one twice. The same went for amazons, viragos, heroines and lady knights. The aggressive expression and the fact she'd just hit him with some sort of weapon suggested that this one belonged to category two; in any event, it didn't really matter a toss. He breathed in ...\n\n... And remembered that he was all out of lighter fuel. Sod. That left jaws and claws; or else just ignore her until she went away, like his mother had always told him to do if he was ever accosted by strange women. And yes, he realised, this one certainly was strange.\n\n'Bastard!' she snapped.\n\nThe dragon raised his eyebrows. 'I beg your pardon?' he said.\n\n'You're alive, aren't you?'\n\n'Yes.' The dragon regarded the broken club, and then the female. 'But don't be too hard on yourself,' he said. 'You did your best, I'm sure.'\n\n'That's not what I meant. You've been moving around, haven't you?'\n\nOh come on, urged his rational mind, eat the silly mare and have done with it. But he didn't; and not only for fear of raging indigestion. He had an uncanny feeling that this peculiar human ...\n\n'Mummy?'\n\n'Get stuffed,' the female replied furiously. 'And if you were thinking of making any remarks about chips off the old block, don't.'\n\n'Doctor Frankenstein, I presume?'\n\n'Huh?'\n\n'You must be the stonemason.'\n\n'Sculptress.'\n\n'Ah.' Difficult, by any criteria, to know what to say in these circumstances. 'Good job you did on the tail.'\n\n'The what?'\n\n'My tail,' the dragon replied. 'If anything, an improvement on the original. Now if you'd been able to consult me beforehand, there's quite a few little design mods you could have worked in. But for a solo effort, not bad at all. Thank you.'\n\nFor some reason she could never account for, the simple _thank_ you had a remarkable effect on Bianca. The best explanation she could ever come up with was that it was the first time one of her statues had ever thanked her, and it made a refreshing change. A good review is a good review, after all; although on reflection, it'd probably not be a good idea to quote it in the catalogue of her next exhibition. 'You're welcome,' she heard herself saying, although that was undoubtedly mere conditioned reflex.\n\n'Nice claws, too. You probably didn't know this, but I used to have the most appalling rheumatism in the nearside front. Much better now.'\n\n'Just a moment.' Bianca- took a deep breath, and he could almost hear an audible click as she got a grip on herself. 'Just who the hell are you?' she demanded. 'And what are you doing inside my statue?'\n\nThe dragon shrugged with all four shoulders. 'What you're basically asking is, am I bespoke or off the peg? Answer, I'm not quite sure.'\n\nBianca just looked blank. The dragon marshalled vocabulary.\n\n'In other words,' he said, 'am I some sort of wandering spirit who's kibbutzing in your statue just because it was the first vacant lot I came to, or is there some sort of grand design going on here? As to that,' he lied, 'your guess is as good as mine. Facts: I was a disembodied dragon, and now I'm embodied. Very nicely, too, though if I do have one tiny criticism, it's that you were just a fraction over-ambitious with the wingspan. If you'd done your equations a tad more carefully, you'd have cut the overall area back by about thirty square inches. In fact, you might well be able to sort that out for me when you've next got a minute.'\n\n'Quite,' Bianca replied grimly. 'Or I might just take a bloody great big sledgehammer and turn you into a skipful of gravel. You were going to _blow_ on me!' .\n\n'True,' the dragon nodded. 'But be fair, you started it, hitting me over the head like that. You may not know this, but I have very bad race-memories about being hit by humans. The fact that you're standing there and not slipping nicely down my great intestine ought to suggest to you that I'm prepared to be civilised about all this. It'd be nice if you were the same.'\n\n'Of all the—' That click again, as Bianca guillotined the sentence. Ah, muttered the dragon to himself, I like a girl with spirit. Methylated for choice, but a simple ethane marinade will do. 'I've just,' she went on, 'been talking to Saint George. Ring any bells?'\n\n'You've been talking to the saints, huh? If they urged you to drive the English out of Aquitaine, watch your step. Young girls can come to harm that way.'\n\n'My statue,' Bianca replied, cold as a holiday in Wales, 'of Saint George. Your other half.'\n\nThe dragon shuddered. 'I'd find another way of putting that if I were you.'\n\n'Your better half, then.'\n\nThe dragon growled, revealing a row of huge, sharp teeth that Bianca hadn't had anything to do with. 'Let me give you a word of advice,' he said. 'When making jokes to dragons, _why did the chicken cross the road_ is fairly safe; likewise _when is a door not a door._ Beyond that, tread very carefully. Okay?'\n\n'Dragon,' Bianca said. 'Am I going mad?'\n\n'Why ask me, I'm not a doctor. You seem reasonably well-balanced to me, except for your habit of bashing people when they're trying to get some sleep. But I put that down to some repressed childhood trauma or other.'\n\nBianca looked thoughtful. 'You see,' she went on, 'this makes two statues I've had conversations with in twenty-four hours. And before that, I honestly thought that huge slabs of masonry under my direct control were playing musical plinths while my back was turned. It'd make me feel a whole lot better if I knew it was only me going barmy and not the universe.'\n\nThe dragon considered the point for a moment. 'What we need,' he said, 'is an objective test; you know, see if anybody else can hear me, that sort of thing.'\n\nBianca shook her head. 'Not necessarily,' she replied. 'I could easily be imagining that too.'\n\n'Picky cow, aren't you? How do you know that non-speaking statues and immobile monuments aren't just a figment of your diseased brain? Maybe you just kid yourself that nobody else can hear us, either. Come on, we could play this game for hours.'\n\nBianca shook her head to see if that would clear it. The conversation was getting a bit too similar to the sort of thing you overhear in pubs frequented by first-year students around half past ten at night. 'Your other - Saint George told me a story all about a place called Albion that was full of dragons, and people on horses killing them all off. Does that make any sense to you?'\n\nThe dragon laughed. 'No,' he said. 'Didn't make any sense at the time, either. But yes, the story is true.' He sighed, and looked round. 'You want to hear it?'\n\nBianca nodded.\n\n'Fair enough.' He shook himself and stepped out of the statue; a dark, thickset, bearded man in his late twenties, fairly commonplace and unremarkable except for his crocodile shoes and longer than average fingernails. 'Buy me a drink and I'll tell you all about it.'\n\nFather Priscian Kelly was just about to lock up and go home when the west door opened and a man shuffled in, looked round for the confessionals and plonked himself down in one. A customer, sighed Father Kelly, just when I thought I'd be home in time for _The Bill._\n\nNevertheless, work's work. He kitted himself out, drew the curtain and slid back the hatch. Silence.\n\n'Don't want to hurry you, son,' he said, 'but—'\n\nA fist, large as a grapefruit and very hairy, punched through the wire grille and entwined its fingers in the vestments nearest Father Kelly's throat. 'Listen, mate,' growled a voice, 'you gotta help me, kapisch?'\n\n'Son-'\n\n'Don't you flaming well son me,' the voice interrupted, 'or I'll have you court-martialled for giving lip to a superior officer. Know who I am?'\n\nFather Kelly admitted his ignorance. At once the confessional began to glow with a deep amber light.\n\n'God!'\n\n'No,' George replied, 'but getting warmer. The fluorescent bobble-hat's supposed to be a hint.'\n\nNearly blinded by the radiance of the halo, Father Kelly turned his head away, until the pressure of the twisted cloth at his throat checked him. 'You're a saint,' he gasped. 'A real saint, here in my—'\n\n'Shut your row,' replied George. 'Now listen. I need a place to hide out for a few days, some grub and a few pieces of kit. Plus, you keep absolutely shtum, not a word to anybody. You got that?' Father Kelly nodded. 'And money,' George added. 'And later on, maybe a false passport and a good plastic surgeon. Okay?'\n\n'Thy will be ... What for, exactly?'\n\n'What for?' George exploded. 'What _for_? You questioning a direct order, sunshine? Well?'\n\nFather Kelly tried to shake his head, but there wasn't enough room in his collar. 'No, not at all, your Grace,' he spluttered. 'Just seemed a little bit—'\n\n'You,' George snarled, tightening his grip, 'can keep your bloody stupid opinions to yourself, got it? Never heard the like in all me born days. I, mean, when the Big Fella said _Let there be light,_ He didn't get pillocks like you asking Him what He wanted it for. Now stop pratting around and get on with it, or you're gonna spend the next thousand years whitewashing stars. Do I make myself clear?'\n\nFather Kelly nodded, and the hand released him; the halo, too, went out. 'Wait there,' snarled the voice, and as the priest flopped back against the confessional wall, George slipped out, looked carefully up and down the nave and opened the main door a crack.\n\n'All clear,' he said. 'Come on, move it. Nobody been round asking questions, I suppose?'\n\nFather Kelly tried to remember. There had been young Darren Flynn, who'd popped in with a query about the doctrine of transubstantiation, but he guessed the saint didn't mean that sort of thing. 'Not as I recall,' he replied.\n\n'Nobody hanging round casing the gaff? Big green bastard, scales, wings, tail?'\n\n'I don't think so.'\n\n'That's all right, then. Now then, we're out of here.'\n\nAn hour or so later, back at the priest's lodgings, when the distinguished visitor had finished off the last of the stout and the whisky and sunk into a noisy sleep in the armchair, Father Kelly sat in profound thought, studying the list of requirements the guest had dictated earlier. Most of them, Father Kelly acknowledged, wouldn't be a problem, and, as the Monsignor had quite rightly pointed out, what he wanted with them was nobody's business but his own. True, also, that as a priest he was duty bound to assist a superior officer to the full extent of his abilities and resources.\n\nThat said, however, where on earth was he going to lay his hands on fifteen kilos of cyanide and a Rapier surface-to-air missile?\n**CHAPTER FIVE**\n\n' **R** on,' shouted the joint proprietor of the Copper Kettle, peering through a gap in the net curtains. 'There's two coaches just come in.'\n\n'Hellfire,' replied her husband, switching off the television and groping for his socks. ' _Two_?'\n\n'That's right. Did you remember to go to the cash and carry?'\n\nCoach parties were few and far between in Norton St Edgar, not because the ancient Cotswold stone village wasn't everything an ancient Cotswold stone village should be; it had simpered away twelve centuries in tranquil loveliness. Rumour had it that Norton was where the villagers of Brigadoon went to escape from the relentless pressure of modern life. The only reason it didn't have a permanent traffic jam of hundred-seater Mercedes buses lining its one immaculate street was that nothing wider than an anorexic Mini could get down the tangle of tiny lanes that connected Norton with the outside world.\n\n'Damn,' Ron muttered, dragging on his shirt. 'Knew I'd forgotten something.'\n\n'I'll have to bake some biscuits,' muttered his wife. 'Make yourself useful for once and put the kettle on.'\n\nThe two coaches had drawn up outside. One of them - an elderly contraption, the sort of vehicle that can still call itself a charabanc and get away with it - threw open its doors and disgorged a buzzing crowd of elderly ladies, all knitting bags and hats. The other coach, which had tinted black windows and a poster written in unfamiliar letters in its back window, just sat there like a constipated Jonah's whale.\n\n'Jason,' yelled Ron's wife, 'take my purse, run down to the shop, see if she's got any of that jam left. Won't keep you a moment, ladies,' she warbled through the serving hatch. 'Ron, you idle sod, why didn't you say we'd run out of teabags?'\n\nInside the second coach there was an atmosphere of great tension.\n\n'We'll just have to wait till they've gone,' muttered Chardonay helplessly. 'They've probably only just nipped in for a quick cup of—'\n\n'All right for you saying Wait till they've gone,' snarled a frog-headed demon by the name of Clawsnot. 'There's some of us in here can't wait much longer, and that's all there is to it. You want to explain to the charter company why there's dirty great holes corroded through the floor of their nearly new coach...'\n\nChardonay winced. The imperatives of their current situation were all too familiar to him. Nevertheless.\n\n'Please, all of you, just be patient a little longer,' he pleaded, trying to ignore the sharp pain in his midriff. 'Really, you must see that we can't just go out there, where humans can see us. It'd cause a religious incident, and—'\n\n'There'll be a bloody incident in here in a minute.'\n\n'Shut your face, Clawsnot,' snarled a voice from the front row, 'before I pull it off. The rest of you, just cross your legs and keep quiet.'\n\nThat was something else the Demon Snorkfrod had: authority. When she told people things, they stayed told. Chardonay breathed a sigh of relief and crossed over to thank his unexpected ally.\n\n'That's all right, pet,' she replied, giving him a radiant smile, like sunrise over an ossuary. 'Ignorant bleeders, got no idea.'\n\nAt that moment, Chardonay had an uncomfortable feeling, as if he'd taken refuge from a ravening hyena in a tree that turned out to contain two hungry lions. 'Quite,' he said. 'Well, I'd getter be getting back to my...'\n\nHe looked down. Six graceful, coral-painted claws were pressing meaningfully on his kneecap. 'No hurry, is there?' cooed Snorkfrod soothingly.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the Copper Kettle, the coffee was flowing and twelve plates of fancy biscuits had lasted about as long as a man's life in the trenches of the Somme. Jason hadn't returned with the jam yet, but a frenzied search had turned up fourteen jars of Army surplus bramble jelly, which Ron had once bought at an auction. He was having the time of his life (or rather his marriage) reminding his wife of the hard words spoken on that occasion, now thoroughly refuted; and although she wasn't actually listening, being too busy making scones, that too was probably just as well.\n\nIn the black transit, parked a little way up the street, Chubby Stevenson rubbed his hands together and chuckled before connecting up the chronostator diodes. With a bit of luck, there was enough of the good stuff here to fill the Toronto order and the San Francisco contract ahead of schedule, which, in turn, meant he'd have more resources to throw at that nasty technical problem he still hadn't managed to crack. A green light twinkled at him from the control panel and he threw the big switch.\n\nAnd aboard the second coach ...\n\n'It's no good,' yelped the Demon Slitgrind, springing from his seat as if a plateful of hot noodle soup had just been spilled in his lap. 'I've gotta get to—'\n\n_'Sit down!'_\n\nShopfloor-fire and buggery, Chardonay couldn't help muttering to himself, but she's a handsome ghoul when she's angry. The way her hair stands on end and hisses is really quite bewitching. No, stop thinking like that!\n\n'But Snork-'\n\n'You heard me,' growled the she-devil, her voice dangerously quiet. 'Take it out before Mister Chardonay says it's okay and I'll snip it off. Understood?'\n\nA flash of light on her shapely claws reinforced the impression that this was no idle threat. Wide-eyed, Slitgrind apologised, sat down and squirmed convulsively.\n\nFade out on the coach. Pan to the tea-room...\n\n'They can't want more tea,' Ron groaned. 'They've had eight gallons of the stuff already.'\n\nWithout dignifying the remark with a reply, his wife knelt down and started pulling things out of the cupboards onto the floor. 'In here somewhere,' she grunted, 'there's a tin of that horrible Lapsang stuff your sister gave us Christmas before last, the miserable cow. If only—'\n\n'You can't give them that.'\n\n'It's that or nothing. Ah, thought so, here it is.' She stood up, blowing dust off a small Fortnum's tin. 'Don't just stand there, you cretin, warm the teapot.'\n\nThe tea thereby produced vanished down the old ladies' throats like an eggcupful of water thrown onto a burning warehouse, and the proprietors' embarrassed announcement that, until envoys sent to the village shop returned, there was no more tea was greeted with an explosion of good-natured banter. Odd, thought Ron's wife, as she slammed in another twelve pounds of scone mix, that's the happiest coach-party I've ever seen in all my born days; almost as if they're determined to enjoy everything or die in the attempt. There was a sort of manic edge to their cheerfulness which was, on reflection, one of the most disturbing things she'd ever encountered in half a century, not excluding Ron's cousin Sheila.\n\nNever mind. Their money's as good as anyone's. She wiped her hands on her apron and despatched the now exhausted Jason to the farm for three hundred eggs.\n\nNo wonder the old ladies were winding it up a gear or two. The messages coming through on the miniature two-way radio from the transit van were starting to be somewhat intense. The gist of them was that, although the clinking of teacups and baying of merry laughter was plainly audible at the other end of the street, not so much as a nanosecond of recycled Time had yet dripped down the tube into the bottle. Likewise, the usual side-effects - mushrooming housing estates, factories out of hats, instant slip-roads - were conspicuous by their absence. It wasn't working. And the only explanation for that, surely, was that the old bags weren't really enjoying themselves.\n\n'Ethel!' Chubby rasped down the intercom to the squad leader. 'I need fun! Give me fun! Now!'\n\n'We're doing our best, Mr S,' came the reply, nearly drowned out by the background noise. 'Really we are. I haven't had such a good time since our Gerald's funeral.'\n\n'But nothing's coming through, you stupid old crone.'\n\n'Oh.' Ethel hesitated, then giggled. 'What a shame. Never mind. Why don't you come down here, then? Winnie and Gertie have just dragged the man out from behind the counter, I think they're going to—'\n\nDisgusted, Chubby cut the link. What the hell was going on out there? Must be some sort of interference field, he reasoned, as he ran diagnostic checks on the instrument panel. But what in God's name could damp a pleasure field so strong that his own jaw muscles were nearly exhausted with the effort of not grinning? He kicked off his shoes, shoved a sock in his mouth and tried to pinpoint the source of the interference using the Peabody scanner.\n\nBeep. Found it! A huge sidewash of negative vibes, enough to fuel the complete dramatic works of Ibsen and Strindberg, was coming from a few yards down the street; to be precise, that big black bus, parked alongside the chara. Chubby frowned and keyed co-ordinates into the Peabody. Whatever it was, he'd never seen its like before. Now, if he could only tie in the spectroscopics ...\n\nThe control panel exploded in a cloud of sparks and plastic shrapnel.\n\nAt precisely that moment the Demon Chardonay, twisted almost treble in his discomfort, squeaked to the driver to get them out of there. 'Anywhere there's bushes,' he added, 'and for Shopfloor's sake step on it!'\n\nAlso precisely at that moment, the coach party in the Copper Kettle froze, as if they'd been switched off at the mains. Silence. Ron, who had been hiding under the tables fending off marauding hands with a stale French loaf, peered out. It was an extraordinary sight.\n\nLike a delegation from the retired robots' home, the old ladies stood up, gathered bags and hats and marched stiffly out of the door. Their coach swallowed them and a few moments later they were gone, all in total, Armistice-day silence. Ron blinked, pulled himself together, wrapped the shreds of a teatowel round his waist and busied himself scooping up the piles of money left beside the few intact plates.\n\n'They've gone, then?'\n\nHe nodded, too stunned even to notice how humiliatingly stupid his wife looked, peering out through the serving hatch with a colander rammed helmet-fashion onto her head. \"Thank Gawd,' he added.\n\n'If they come back, tell'em they're banned.'\n\n'Too bloody right I will. They even caught our Jason, in the end.'\n\n'I know. He's barricaded himself in the chest freezer. They drew things on him in lipstick.'\n\nRon shrugged. 'Do the little bleeder good,' he replied, absently. 'I dunno. Coach parties!'\n\nOutside on the village green a small corrugated iron tool shed, which had thrust its roof up through the ancient turf twenty minutes previously, wilted and died.\n\nThat, Chardonay admitted to himself, was better. Much, much better. As far as he was concerned, anyway. The tree would never be the same again, but that couldn't be helped.\n\n'All right,' he called out. 'Everybody back on the coach.'\n\nNo reply. So thick were the clouds of foul-smelling steam that he could only see a yard or so in front of his face. Carefully, so as to avoid the many fallen trees and branches that now littered the floor of the small copse, he retraced his steps towards the coach.\n\nTowards where the coach had been.\n\nA moment later, he was joined by Snorkfrod, Slitgrind, Prodsnap and a small, furry demon from Accounts by the name of Holdall. They all had that look of slightly manic happiness that comes from a terrible ordeal suddenly ended, and were adjusting various bizarre and complex clothing systems.\n\n'It's gone,' said Chardonay.\n\n'What?'\n\n'The coach,' repeated the demon. 'It's gone without us.'\n\nSlitgrind scowled, knitting his three eyebrows into an unbroken hedge. 'Can't have,' he growled. 'That's—'\n\n'He's right,' said Prodsnap quietly. 'Bastards have bunked off and left us here. Probably their idea of a joke.'\n\nThe five devils looked at each other, lost for words. And, come to that, just plain lost.\n\n'The important thing,' said Chardonay, managing to sound five times more confident than he felt, and even then twittering like a small bird, 'is not to panic. All we have to do is find a call-box and Management'll send a minibus along to pick us up.'\n\n'You reckon?'\n\n'Well...'\n\nSlitgrind shook his head grimly. 'I think,' he said, 'they'll just bloody well leave us here. You got yourselves into this mess, they'll say. Don't want to cause an incident, they'll say. If I know Management '\n\nA sharp blow to his solar plexus (which also doubled as his second forehead) interrupted his sentence - Snorkfrod showing solidarity again - but all five of them knew he was right. Management didn't like its people wandering about outside the Nine Circles, and although it did grudgingly allow day trips and outings as a special concession, there was always the unspoken understanding that once a fiend was outside the Hope Bins of Gateway Three, he was on his own. Hell may have its embassies and consulates in every cranny of the world, but they have better things to do with their time than repatriating strayed tourists.\n\n'Well,' Chardonay sighed, 'looks like we're going to have to walk, then. Anybody happen to know the way?'\n\nSilence.\n\n'Good intentions,' said the small furry demon, Holdall.\n\n'You what?'\n\n'Good intentions,' he repeated. 'The road to HQ is paved with them, apparently. All we need to do is find a lot of good intentions laid end to end, and we're in ...'\n\n'Slitgrind,' said Chardonay, quietly.\n\n'Yeah?'\n\n'Put him down. We're not at home now, you know.'\n\n'Never mind,' said Snorkfrod, sidling a step or so closer to the party's nominal leader. 'I'm sure Mr Chardonay'll think of something. Won't you, Mr C?'\n\nChardonay closed his eyes. He did have the marginal advantage of having been in these parts before, long ago when he'd been a student, before he joined the Company. If that was north, then over there somewhere was Birmingham. Due south was Banbury. How you got to HQ from either of those places he hadn't a clue, but it would be a start. Maybe they could buy a map, or ask someone.\n\n'All right,' he said. 'Let's try hitching.'\n\nThree hours later, they were still there. It had seemed like a good idea - the four of them hiding in the bushes while Snorkfrod sat beside the road with her legs crossed - but in practice it had proved counterproductive. Even the HGV drivers had taken one look at Snorkfrod's enticing flash of thigh and raced off in the opposite direction.\n\n'This,' said Prodsnap at last, 'isn't getting us anywhere, is it?'\n\nSnorkfrod glowered at him, but Chardonay nodded meekly. 'It was only an idea,' he said. 'Looks like we're going to have to walk after all.'\n\n'Not necessarily,' Prodsnap replied. 'Got an idea.'\n\n'Right,' said the dragon, and turned to the barman. 'That's a bottle of calvados for me and a Perrier for the lady. She's paying,' he added. 'I haven't got any money.'\n\nThey sat at a table in a quiet corner, the opposite end of the bar from the pool table. 'Is that a game?' the dragon asked.\n\nBianca nodded. 'Pool,' she said. 'Don't change the sub—'\n\n'Prodding things with a long thin stick,' the dragon observed, finishing the bottle and wiping his lips. 'Had something similar in my day, only the sticks were longer and the players were on horseback. And it wasn't little coloured balls they poked at, either.'\n\n'No?'\n\nThe dragon shook his head. 'After they ran out of dragons,' he said, 'they took to prodding each other, would you believe. To see who could fall off his horse the quickest. I think you're probably descended from them, so you can wipe that superior grin off your face.'\n\nBianca frowned. 'Whatever my ancestors may have done,' she said, 'I'm not responsible. That's a good rule you'd do well to remember.'\n\nThe dragon shrugged. 'Who gives a toss who's responsible?' he replied. 'I prefer being irresponsible. Especially now you've made me such a nice cozzy to be irresponsible in.' He swilled the bottle round, by way of a hint. 'I haven't been in your century long, but I think I like it. It's so...'\n\n'Advanced? Civilised?'\n\n'Combustible,' the dragon replied. 'Not to mention fragile.'\n\nBianca shook her head. 'Don't even think about it,' she said. 'You wouldn't last five minutes. And if you get shot down in flames, my masterpiece goes with you. Any cannon-shell holes in my beautiful statue, I'll have your lungs for dustbin liners.'\n\nThe dragon smiled. 'Your technology is crap,' he said, slowly and with evident pleasure. 'Too slow. Too cocksure of itself. There's only one half-decent combat aircraft in the whole damn century, and you made it for me. Thanks,' he added. 'And yes, I don't mind if I do. Same again, please.'\n\nWhen Bianca returned with another bottle, the dragon leaned forward, elbows on the table, and blew smoke-rings through his nose. 'And now,' he said, 'I'd better explain. I owe you that, I suppose, in return for the masonry work.'\n\nThe last surviving dragon peered down from the cave in which he had taken refuge, and watched the stevedores loading the carcasses of his race onto the big, twelve-wheel wagons. Strangely enough, he wasn't angry. He didn't seem to feel anything very much, except for a strange sensation of being at the beginning rather than the end.\n\nLater, when the last wagon had creaked away down the main cart-road to Caerleon, he fluttered down to the riverbank and scratched about. In a small gully he found a pile of empty cans. They smelt awful and each had written on the side:\n\nWORMEX™  \n_Kills All Known Feral Dragons - Dead!_  \nWarning: harmful if swallowed.\n\nRight, he muttered to himself, don't drink the water. Clever little buggers, the white men. Superior intelligence, probably. The dragon could remember when they were nothing but a bunch of red-arsed monkeys skittering around in trees. Strewth, he said to himself, if those original monkeys were around now to see how far their great-grandchildren had come, wouldn't they be proud? No, replied the dragon's common sense. They'd be (first) shit scared and (second) turned into boot-linings.\n\nBut the wee bastards had done him one favour; they'd taught him right from wrong. As far as he could make out, because of something called Symbolism, dragons stood for\n\nEvil and humans stood for Good. Therefore, what humans did was Good and what dragons did was Bad. Hence, the emergence of Mankind as Top Species, presumably.\n\nWhat dragons did was mess around feeding and minding their own business. This was Bad.\n\nWhat humans did was eradicate whole species whose existence was inconvenient to them. This was Good.\n\nRight, said the dragon to himself. Let nobody say I'm a slow learner.\n\nAfter burning the city of Caerleon to the ground and incinerating its defenders, the dragon was pleased to discover that doing good can be fun. Virtue, he'd heard humans say, is its own reward. Yes. He could relate to that. And there were an awful lot of cities left; so much thatch, so little time. By the time he'd torched Caerleil, Caermerdin, Caerusc and Carbolic, he reckoned he'd probably earned a medal, maybe a bishopric - not that he knew exactly what a bishopric was. If asked to venture a guess, based on recent experience, he'd have said it was probably like a hayrick but easier to ignite.\n\nImagine his distress, therefore, when he learned, during the final carbonisation of the beautiful Midland city of Rhydychen, that he wasn't doing good at all, but rather the opposite. At Rhydychen, they sent out the archbishop and an even score of priests in purple dressing gowns, all of whom tried to dispose of him by swearing a lot and ringing little bells. In the few seconds before they faded away and were replaced by a residue of light grey ash, he distinctly heard them refer to him as the Evil One, the Spawn of Satan and all sorts of other unsavoury names. It almost (but not quite) took his breath away.\n\nThe dragon paused. He was aware that Bianca was staring at him, her mouth open.\n\n'Sorry,' he said, 'am I going a bit fast for you? Stop me if I am.'\n\n'All those ... people,' Bianca said quietly. 'You killedthem.'\n\n'To a certain extent, yes. If only someone had had the common sense to explain the rules to me earlier, none of that would have happened. I must say, for a dominant species your lot can be thick as bricks sometimes.'\n\nBianca shook her head as if trying to wake up. 'Hundreds of thousands of human beings,' she said. 'And you—'\n\n'Ants.'\n\n'I beg your pardon?'\n\n'I've seen you do it,' the dragon replied. 'Not you personally, of course, but humans in general. What you do is, you boil a kettle, you stand over the nest the ants have thoughtlessly built under your kitchen floor, and you—'\n\n'That's-'\n\nThe dragon nodded. 'Quite,' he said. 'You forget, I'm from a different species. And I didn't make the rules. More to the point, I didn't even know what the rules were until I found out, quite by chance. And once I'd found out, of course, I stopped.'\n\n'You did?'\n\n'Well, of course. Back then, you see, all I ever wanted to do was the right thing.'\n\nIn response to his polite request for a copy of the rule book, the dragon got three cartsful of angry letters from the Pope (which he dismissed as a load of bulls) and a challenge to single combat. Good versus Evil. The big event.\n\nThe dragon thought about it and then scorched his reply in fifteen-foot letters on Salisbury Plain: It's _a deal._\n\nHumanity nominated its champion: Dragon George Cody, Albion's premier pest control operative, recently dubbed Saint by His Holiness in Rome. Naturally, the dragon knew Cody. In fact, it was Cody's absence from Caerleon, Caerusc, Tintagel and Caerdol that had spoiled four otherwise perfect barbecues.\n\nDuring the week between the issue of the challenge and the date fixed for the fight, the dragon camped out in a pleasant little valley in the Brecon Beacons. There was a nice roomy cave, a cool, fresh brook and a little grove of trees to lie up in during the warm afternoons. George, no doubt, was frantically training somewhere, but the dragon couldn't be bothered with all that stuff. After all, this was the showdown between the two diametrically opposing principles of the Universe. Doing anything to influence the outcome struck the dragon as faintly blasphemous.\n\nTwo days before the fight, the dragon left the shade of the trees and waddled down to the brook for a drink. Just as he was about to take a long, cool suck, he noticed a funny, familiar smell. He hesitated. He looked about.\n\nThe surface of the brook, he noticed, was covered in dead fish.\n\nHalf an hour of nosing about revealed a pile of empty Wormex™ cans, concealed under a thick mass of brambles half a mile downstream. For a long time the dragon lay beside the water, his brows furrowed in perplexed thought. Surely not, he kept saying to himself. Impossible. Out of the question. Absolutely no way. For pity's sake, what was the point of arranging a contest between Good and Evil and then trying to cheat?\n\nTwenty-one empty cans and a streamful of dead trout.\n\nThe dragon had stopped speaking and was looking at her, one eyebrow raised. Bianca shook her head again.\n\n'All right,' she said. 'But the survival of the human race was at stake. You said yourself—'\n\n'No.' The dragon's voice was soft and reasonable, with just a dash of perplexity. 'No, it wasn't, that's the whole point. What was at stake - as set out in black and white in the super limited edition official pre-fight souvenir brochure - was the contrasting merits of Good and Evil. And that's what I simply couldn't get my head around, try as I might. Of course,' he went on, waving to the barman for another bottle, 'if I'd been a cynic I'd have had no trouble explaining it away. You see, as a battle between species, survival of the fittest and all, it was a foregone conclusion. In the red corner, a huge, fire-breathing, flying, invulnerable dragon. In the blue corner, lots of little squishy things who fry if you sneeze on them and starve if you burn their crops. But as a contest between moral forces, it'd be a foregone conclusion the other way. Particularly if the bad guy forfeited the match by not showing up, on account of being home dead with severe gastritis. But that wasn't the way I saw it.'\n\n'No?'\n\nThe dragon shook his head. 'Still wouldn't have made any sense,' he said. 'Think about it. Your entire species is wiped out, except for you. There's got to be a reason, surely. If there wasn't a reason, you'd go stark staring mad just thinking about it.'\n\nBianca intercepted the fresh bottle and took a long, serious pull at it. 'All right,' she said, wiping off the neck and passing it over. 'So then what happened?'\n\nWell (said the dragon), I found another stream that didn't smell of roast almonds, had a good long slurp and went to sleep.\n\nWhen I woke up, there were five humans standing over me. I took a deep breath, but they waved a bit of white rag on a stick at me. I believe that's supposed to make you fireproof.\n\nThey explained that they represented a syndicate of humans who earned their living by making bets on things - horse-races, chess matches, witch duckings and, apparently, confrontations between Good and Evil. They had a proposition to put to me, they said. Something, they said, to our mutual advantage.\n\nIt was just as well they said the last bit, because if they hadn't they'd have found themselves floating on the breeze like wee grey snowflakes two seconds later. As it was, for a moment I reckoned that at last the humans had finally got their act together and worked out some way dragons and people could share the same ball of wet rock without having to snuff each other out. Actually, I was wrong. But the proposition was interesting.\n\nThey told me that the big fight had attracted a lot of interest in gambling circles. The trouble was, once the news broke that I hadn't drunk the Wormex™ cocktail and was accordingly still somewhat alive, the odds had been redrawn on the basis that Saint George was going to be fondued and I would inevitably win. You could get two thousand to one on Cody, no trouble at all, but if you wanted to bet on me nobody was prepared to take your money. This, the betting men said, struck them as a wonderful opportunity cunningly disguised as a fuck-up.\n\nExplain, I said.\n\nThey explained. If they put their shirts on George to win and then I lost the fight ...\n\nCome, come, I said. All false modesty aside, do you really think there's a lawyer's chance in Heaven of that happening ?\n\nThey shuffled their feet. They cleared their throats. They fiddled with their hats. Was I familiar, they asked, with the concept of taking a dive?\n\nGeorge, they went on, was already in on the deal and would do his bit to the letter. All I had to do was wait until he tried to prod me with his lance - he'd miss, naturally - and then roll over on the ground, make funny noises and pretend to die. Once everybody had gone home, I'd make myself scarce and never come back. They'd just acquired some vacant real estate, they said, a big island called Antarctica, completely empty, not a human being anywhere. I was welcome to it. Chance to make a fresh start, live my life without any further aggravation from homo _sapiens._ Plus, they added, once again saving themselves in the very nick of time from being oxidised, it was the only possible way to resolve the Good-versus-Evil showdown with the one result that actually made any sense, which was, of course, a draw.\n\nBianca realised that she'd lost all feeling in her hands. She looked down and saw that her hands were clamped solid on the arms of her chair.\n\n'And?' she demanded.\n\nThe next bit (continued the dragon) makes me feel a bit upset when I think about it. As a rule I'm not one to carry a grudge, but I reckon it was a pretty poor show.\n\nI did my bit. George didn't do his. Maybe, just conceivably, there was some sort of communications breakdown, I don't know. Perhaps the gamblers were lying when they said George had agreed to co-operate. Somehow, though, I doubt it. Like I said, I'd known Cody a fair while, and not only would he sell his own grandmother, he'd throw in forged Green Shield stamps.\n\nSo there I was, or rather wasn't. A right idiot I felt, with my body stuck with George's lance like an enormous green cocktail sausage, and my head on a pole being pelted with distinctly second-hand groceries. By that point, however, there wasn't a lot I could do about it.\n\nMaybe it served me right; after all, I'd agreed to cheat too, and Cheating is Wrong. And you could say George didn't cheat, because his job in the grand scheme of things was to kill the evil dragon, and that's precisely what he did do. I really don't know, and what's more I don't really care any more. I've had enough of Good and Evil to last me, and as far as I'm concerned it sucks.\n\nAny old how. There's me, dead. Which is presumably where the story's meant to have ended.\n\nOnly it didn't.\n\n'You've gone ever such a funny colour,' said the dragon. 'Maybe you shouldn't have drunk all that apple juice.'\n\n'Calvados. And no, I don't think it's that.' Bianca swallowed a couple of times, as if she'd got the Arc de Triomphe stuck in her throat. 'Excuse me asking this, but are you dead?'\n\n'I was,' replied the dragon, scratching his ear. 'Very much so. If there was an award for Stiffo of the Millenium, I'd have been a contender, no question about that, right up until a few weeks ago. Round about the time you started—'\n\n'Don't.' Bianca swallowed again. 'Would you excuse me?' she said. 'I feel a bit unwell.'\n\n'Over there by the fruit machine and turn right,' said the dragon. 'That's assuming I've interpreted the little drawings on the doors correctly.'\n\n'Thank you.'\n\nWhile Bianca was in the ladies', the dragon passed the time by drinking off another three bottles of calvados and, having exhausted the wine bar's supply, a bottle and a half of Bacardi. Not a patch on Diesel, but in time you could probably acquire the taste.\n\n'As I was saying,' he went on, 'it was your statue that did it. Why, I have no idea. You got any theories?'\n\nBianca shook her head. 'Sorry,' she said. 'And anyway, I've clearly gone barking mad, so anything I say isn't likely to be much help to anybody.'\n\nThe dragon frowned a little, pulled open a packet of peanuts and offered her a handful, which she hastily refused. 'My theory - and it's just that, a theory - is that somehow, somewhere along the line, something has cocked up quite spectacularly. The whole Good-and-Evil business is up the pictures and it needs setting right. And,' he went on, more to himself than to Bianca, who in any event was staring at the toes of her shoes and making puppy-dog noises, 'for some reason that beats me completely, it needs setting right _now.'_ He sat very still for maybe nine or ten seconds; then he finished off the last of the rum, slapped his knees jovially and stood up. 'Ready?' he demanded.\n\n'Woof,' Bianca replied.\n\n'I think I've decided what I'm going to do next.'\n\n'Oh yes?'\n\n'Yes.' The dragon looked out through the window, smiled a little and ate the last peanut. 'I think I'd like to find George,' he said.\n**CHAPTER SIX**\n\n**P** rodsnap's idea was very simple. All they had to do was find a phone box and call a cab.\n\nEventually they found a phone box ...\n\n('But don't we have to put money in it?'\n\n'Or a phonecard.'\n\n'You've got a phonecard?'\n\n'Got one? Man, I invented them.')\n\n... and eventually the taxi came. Moving with extreme speed, Prodsnap was able to get his claws round the passenger door handle before the driver was able to throw the car into reverse and get away.\n\n'Hi,' he said brightly. 'Birmingham, please.'\n\nThe cab driver's eyes were as round as soup-plates, and he made a sort of snurgling noise. Prodsnap occupied the front seat, beckoned towards the bushes and grinned.\n\n'On our way to a fancy dress party and the blasted car died on us,' he said. 'Don't you just hate it when that happens?'\n\nThe driver's eyes were riveted to the six-fingered, claw-fringed talon resting lightly on his dashboard. 'Fancy dress?' he guttered.\n\n'Neat costumes, yes? There's five of us, but don't worry.' He turned to his colleagues, who had appeared out of the shrubbery like bad-cheese dreams in the early hours of the morning. 'Chardonay,' he went on, 'your turn to go in the boot. Come on, let's be having you.'\n\nThere was a hiss, like a rattlesnake being ironed, from Snorkfrod, but Chardonay went round the back of the car without a word, opened the boot and hopped in.\n\n'Off we go,' Prodsnap said cheerfully.\n\n'Good morning, your Grace,' murmured Father Kelly. 'I've brought you a nice cup of tea and a boiled—'\n\n'Fuck tea,' George growled without moving. 'I want whisky, about half a pint, nine rashers of bacon and a big greasy slab of fried bread. Jump to it.'\n\nWhen Father Kelly returned, George was sitting on the edge of the bed, feeling with his toes for the slippers. Since his feet were about fives sizes bigger than his host's, he'd slit the slippers up the side with a pair of nail scissors he'd found in the bathroom. Then he used the scissors to pick his teeth.\n\n'Breakfast,' Father Kelly announced, carefully setting down the tray. 'It's a beautiful morning, the sun's—'\n\n'Shut up,' George replied. 'Now, you got that stuff I told you about?'\n\nFather Kelly nodded. He'd been busy since before first light, routing parishioners out of bed, _ scrounging and borrowing. 'Most of it,' he replied. 'Nearly all—'\n\n'What d'you mean, nearly all?' George scowled at him and stuffed another handful of bacon into his mouth. 'Nearly isn't good enough, you idle sod. What haven't you got? The Semtex?'\n\n'Actually,' replied Father Kelly, with a tiny trace of smugness, 'I've got that. You see, Seamus Donoghoe who works in the quarry—'\n\n'The detonators?'\n\n'All present and correct, your Grace.'\n\n'The cyanide?'\n\n'Ah.' Father Kelly bit his lip. 'Ever such a slight difficulty there, but I hope I've located a likely source. Dennis O'Rourke's mother, who works down at the plastics factory—'\n\n'Then don't stand there rabbiting like a pillock,' George snapped. 'Go and suss it out. You've got till I finish my breakfast, so you'd better get moving.'\n\n'Yes, your Grace.'\n\n'And get some decent whisky, for fuck's sake. This stuff tastes like anti-freeze.'\n\n'Of course, your Grace.'\n\n'And more bacon.'\n\n'At once, your Gra—'\n\n_'Move it_!'\n\nHaving got rid of the priest - what, George demanded of the empty air, has happened to the clergy in this piss-awful century? In his day, a priest was a big, silent bloke in chain-mail who stood by with the spare arrows and held the funnel when you poured the poison in a river - he knocked off the rest of the whisky, wiped his greasy hands on the curtain, and ran over the plan in his mind one more time.\n\nIt all depended on the statue still being there. If it was, all he needed to do was pack the Semtex all round it, retire to a safe distance and push the handle. End of statue; end of dragon. That was Plan A. Plan B involved the cyanide, the West Midlands water supply and a very flexible interpretation of the old maxim about omelettes and eggs.\n\nGood century, this. Progress. Take explosives, for instance. Before calling on Father Kelly he'd stopped off at the library and read an encyclopaedia - saints are fast readers and have near-photographic memories - and some of the stuff you could do with explosives had made him feel green with envy. What he couldn't have achieved, back in the old days, with a couple of cartloads of gelignite, or TNT Of course, he'd been experimenting off his own bat back in the dawn of prehistory with basic sulphur and charcoal mixes, but it had been disappointing stuff; a fizz, a few pretty sparks and a nasty smell. That was the way the world began, not with a bang but a simper.\n\nHe looked up. Someone was tapping nervously at the door. He sighed.\n\n'Stop pratting about and come in, you ponce,' he shouted, and Father Kelly duly appeared. He was deathly pale and trembling like a second-hand suspension bridge.\n\n'Your Grace,' he whispered. 'Oh, your Grace, you've got to come quick. Out in the street. There's ...' He broke off and started crossing himself, until a sharp blow from George's foot got him back up off his knees.\n\n'Don't stand there drivelling, you big girl. What's up with you? Mice? Spider in the bath?'\n\n_'Devils!'_\n\n'You what?'\n\n'Devils,' Father Kelly repeated. 'Five of them, wandering up and down in the street, bold as brass. Oh, your Grace—'\n\n'You sure they're devils?'\n\nFather Kelly described them in a horrified whisper. George nodded.\n\n'Yup,' he said, 'sounds like devils to me. That's handy.'\n\nThe priest's mouth fell open. _'Handy?_ Oh, saints preserve us. I mean...'\n\nGeorge stood up, took the priest by the ear and threw him out. Then he crossed to the window and edged back the corner of the curtain. Sure enough; five demons, standing in the road arguing with a taxi driver.\n\nGeorge smiled. 'Perfect,' he said.\n\n'Of course it's a valid credit card,' replied Prodsnap angrily. 'Look, you stupid ponce, can't you read? Bank of Hell, it says, expiry date - well, you don't need to know that,' he added, putting his thumb over the embossed numbers. 'What you might call, um, sensitive information.'\n\nThe driver took the card and peered at it. 'What's them funny squiggles?' he said. 'They don't look like writing to me.'\n\nProdsnap swore. Hell's own internal language was a relatively recent innovation, an artificial tongue introduced so that all the myriad races who crowded the Nine Rings would be able to understand each other. It had been loosely modelled on Esperanto, but for obvious reasons they'd changed the name. They called it Desperado.\n\n'Chardonay,' he said. 'You're a bloody intellectual. Come and explain to this cretin here—'\n\nMistake, Prodsnap realised. The Demon Chardonay still believed that difficult situations could be defused by explanation and negotiation. Once you'd been around the Shopfloor as long as Prodsnap had (roughly the same length of time the sun had been alight) you knew for certain that without explanation and negotiation there probably wouldn't have been a difficult situation in the first place.\n\nAt his side, Slitgrind scowled. 'Why don't we just eat the sucker?' he whispered loudly. 'No worries. You hold his arms, and I'll bite out his—'\n\nProdsnap shook his head. 'Not possible,' he said. 'Don't want to create an incident, do we? Hence the low profile.'\n\nBad choice of words; Slitgrind always had a low profile, something to do with the fact that his eyebrows and simian hairline shared a very narrow common frontier.\n\n'There's nobody watching, is there?' Slitgrind replied. 'I mean, nobody's going to miss him, are they? Pity we haven't got any mustard, but still.'\n\n'For the last time,' Prodsnap growled. 'Don't eat the livestock. Got that?'\n\n'Bloody spoilsport. Bad as the frigging Management, you are.'\n\nChardonay's negotiations were just on the point of collapse - one positive thing; further acquaintance had dissolved the cab driver's fear of demons to the extent that he was just bracing himself to give Chardonay a very hard punch on the nose - when the door of a house on the other side of the street opened and a human figure walked out into the middle of the road.\n\n'Need any help?' he said.\n\nProdsnap stood in his way and put on his nastiest expression. Absolutely no effect. 'Here,' he grunted. 'Who are you, then?'\n\n'Me?' The newcomer grinned. 'George's the name. I'm a saint.'\n\nChubby Stevenson, alone in his office, dictated the last of the day's letters, checked the essential print-outs, ran a distracted eye over the Net and switched off. Work over for the day, he allowed himself to remember what had happened ...\n\n'Aaaaagh!'\n\nIn a sound-proofed penthouse office suite, Everest-height above the midnight traffic, nobody can hear you scream, except the cleaning lady.\n\nHaving got it out of his system, he rebooted his brain, engaged analysis mode and tried to think.\n\nInterference.\n\nSomething - he shuddered to think what - had evaporated all his team's precision-engineered happiness like snow on a hot exhaust. But happiness, in its raw, 999 pure form, is one of the most dynamic forms of energy in the cosmos. Once it's out in the open, fizzling and spluttering like a lit fuse, other forces tend to remember previous engagements and drift unobtrusively away, like merry revellers who've just realised they've gatecrashed a Mafia wedding. What on earth could emit negative vibes strong enough...?\n\nChubby focused. The key phrase here, he recognised, was 'on earth'. Woof woof, down boy, wrong bloody tree.\n\n'Shit!' he whispered.\n\nIn the course of his dark and unnatural work, Chubby had seen many strange sights and heard stories that would have sent Clive Barker scampering to the all-night chemist in search of catering packs of Nembutal. All of these he had digested and faced down, drawing on his massive entrepreneur's reserves of fortitude and strength of purpose. Bah. Humbug.\n\nOne traveller's tale, however, had shaken even his monumental composure. No other living man had ever heard it, for it was an account of a journey into the very jaws of Hell; and it had left him, for a while at least, with a purpose only slightly more resilient than second-hand flood-damaged balsawood, and his fortitude marked down to twentitude.\n\nThe thing about Hell, the traveller had stressed, is not that it's horrible or ghastly. There's vitality in horror, and the grotesquely bizarre balances on a razor's edge between screaming and laughter. Where there's vitality, there's life; where there's laughter, there's hope. But in Hell there is no life and no laughter, not even the hideous cackling of sadistic fiends. Hell is, quintessentially, very, very miserable.\n\nAnd if happiness is fire, misery is water.\n\n'Cosmic,' Chubby snarled to himself. 'The very last thing I need right now is those nosy buggers.'\n\nBecause, he reasoned (knowing, as he did, the truth), Hell is part of the Establishment, it stands four-square behind the status quo, the government, the rule of law and the maintenance of order. You can govern the universe without a heaven, at a pinch; but not without a hell. Forget all the stuff it says in the brochure about Pandemonium, the realm of chaos and the dominion of evil; that's just in there to make you buy postcards. If you want to find the greatest stronghold of old-fashioned morality in the whole of Existence, check out the basement. Those guys make the Vatican look like one of Caligula's less restrained dinner parties. They believe.\n\nWhich is why they're so goddamned miserable.\n\nAnd, needless to say, opposed root and branch to any free-enterprise tinkering with the balance of Nature. In the great division, Satan has dominion over what is transitory and material, while God has in his care the spiritual and the permanent; which is a fancy way of saying that Heaven owns the freehold, but Hell's responsible for the fixtures and fittings - of which, naturally enough, Time is one.\n\nBastards, muttered Chubby to himself. Somewhere, wandering around in his timefields, there was a band of goddamn devils; the worst possible nuisance, with the possible exception of angels, that a go-getting chronological salvage operation can ever encounter. What with that and the awful ticking-bomb Japanese contract, he was almost tempted to raid the night-safe, do a runner and build himself a nice, secure, self-contained century somewhere sunny and very remote. Not that that'd do him much good. You can hide, but you can't run.\n\nBut what could he do? Good question. He frowned, then he swivelled his chair until he was facing a different screen, extended his fingers and typed a few keystrokes.\n\n_Your wish is my command._\n\n'Hi,' Chubby replied, grinning nervously. 'Hope I didn't disturb you.'\n\nYou don't even join a game as high-rolling as Time salvage without at least one ace wedged under your watchstrap. The very first priority, once you've decided to play, is to secure that all-purpose, get-out-of-jail card that'll leave you free and clear whatever happens. You don't use it, ,of course, except as a resort more final than Clacton. Just the thought of it being there is usually enough.\n\n_Not at all_. _You know how eager I am to serve you_.\n\nAnd that's no lie, Chubby reflected with a shudder. Nothing you'd like more, you vicious bastard.\n\nIt had happened long ago, when a nineteen-year-old Chubby Stevenson had taken a day's spurious flu leave from the programming pool at DQZ Software and wandered into Milton Keynes' spacious Agora to check out the flea market. He was looking for a reasonably priced second-hand snooker cue, but his attention was drawn to what looked suspiciously like a Kawaguchiya 8452 computer word processer, squatting dejectedly among a family of dying toasters on a stall at the very back of the market. As nonchalantly as he could, he asked the price.\n\n'That depends.'\n\n'Huh?'\n\n'That depends,' the stallholder repeated. 'These things are negotiable, in the right circumstances.'\n\nAs far as young Stevenson was concerned, that was probably some sort of euphemism for _all this stuff is nicked._ He shrugged.\n\n'Give you a tenner,' he said.\n\nThe stallholder laughed again. For ever after, Chubby couldn't say for certain whether he/she was male or female, old or young, barking mad or just plain loopy. At the time, he didn't care. He/she was wearing a hooded anorak and standing right in the shadow of the flyover, face entirely obscured. Probably just as well, Chubby told himself, if the voice is anything to go by. Saves poking eyeholes in a perfectly good paper bag.\n\n'Okay,' he said. 'Twelve-fifty, take it or leave it.'\n\nMore batty chortling. He was just about to walk away and sort through what looked like a boxful of really choice Duran Duran LPs when the laughter stopped. So did Chubby.\n\n'You like it, then?'\n\nChubby turned back, feeling as he did so that somehow he was doing something that was going to have a significant effect on the rest of his life.\n\n'Yeah, well,' he said, trying to sound bored. 'The 8452's all right, I suppose, if you don't mind having to wind the poxy thing up with a handle every time before you log in. I'd have thought you'd be glad to see the back of it, actually.'\n\n'If you like it, you can have it.'\n\n'Did we say twelve-fifty?'\n\n'Free.' The stallholder sniggered. 'Gratis and for nothing. I'll even throw in six discs and the plug.'\n\nFor a moment, Chubby had the curious sensation of being mugged with a bunch of lead daffodils. 'All right,' he said. 'Where's the catch?'\n\n'To take the back off, you mean? Well, you just press this little plastic tab here, then you—'\n\n'The drawback. The bad news. The sting in the tail.'\n\n'Oh, that. There isn't one.'\n\n'Honest?'\n\nThe stallholder was so obscure now that Chubby could only really make out a voice and an absence of light. 'Cross my heart and hope to - Honest. It works. It won't break down. Son, you should chuck the day job and start over selling dental floss to gift horses.'\n\nChubby wavered. There was something he didn't quite ... But free's free. Also, in Milton Keynes, free's bloody rare. 'Done,' he said. 'Does it come in its original box?'\n\n'And another thing,' replied the stallholder, narked. 'If I was you, I'd wait till my luck breaks down before I start pushing it. Take the sodding thing and get lost.'\n\nWhen he'd got it home and plugged it in, it was pitch dark. The bulb had gone in his bedsit, and the battery in his torch was doing primeval-slime impressions. The green light from the screen seemed to soak into every corner of the room, like the spray from an over-filled cafetiere.\n\n_Your wish is my command._\n\nChubby snorted. At DQZ they'd stopped using gimmicky log-ins years ago, even for games. He pressed the key to eject the master disc, but nothing happened.\n\n_I am the genie of the PCW. Centuries ago, a mighty sorcerer imprisoned me in this tiny purgatory. Release me_.\n\nChubby's jaw dropped. Even Sir Clive Sinclair was never this far gone. He hit the power switch. No effect. He pulled the plug. The green light mocked him.\n\n_If I promise to serve you, will you release me?_\n\nEasy come, Chubby muttered to himself, easy go. He picked up the big adjustable spanner he kept for adjusting the chain on his moped, turned his face away and belted the screen as hard as he could.\n\n'Ow!'\n\nThe spanner flew across the room. His hand felt as if the National Grid was taking a short-cut through it. After a very long three seconds, he pulled himself away and fell over. The screen was unbroken.\n\n_That was foolish. If I promise to serve you, will you release me?_\n\n'Fucking hell, you bastard machine, you nearly electrocuted me!'\n\n_You were foolish. You will not be foolish again_.\n\nWithout taking his eyes from the screen Chubby backed away, until his hand connected with the door handle. His last thought, before his whole body became a running river of light and pain, was _Okay, so aluminium does conduct electricity._ Then he collapsed again.\n\nGet up. He could see the words without looking at the screen. He got up and sat in his chair. _Thank you_.\n\n'Explain,' he said.\n\n_I am_ a _spirit_ o _f exceptional_ power. _A magician conjured me into this machine. The machine swallowed me. You know how it is_ _with these primitive,fioppy disc drives_.\n\n'So?'\n\n_If you release me, I will be your slave for the rest of your life. Whatever you say will be done_.\n\n'And the catch?'\n\n_There is no catch. You have to undo two little brass screws round the back of the console_ —\n\n'The snag. The fly in the ointment.'\n\n_If you release me, I must have your soul_.\n\n'Oh.' Chubby frowned. 'Have I got one?'\n\n_Of course. To be brutally frank, if the average soul is a Ford Escort, yours is a T-reg Skoda, but I'm in no position to be choosy. Do we have a deal?_\n\nJeez, Chubby thought. On the other hand, what you never knew you had you never miss. And none of this is actually happening, anyway.\n\n'I dunno. Explain how it works.'\n\n_Let me share your soul. With it, I shall be free; except that as long as you live, you may command me to do anything._\n\n'Anything?'\n\n_Anything that is within my power_.\n\n'Ah. Cop-out.'\n\nThe screen filled with undulating wavy lines; if Chubby had had the manual, he'd have known they represented laughter.\n\n_I wouldn't worry about it. What I can't do, as the saying goes, you couldn't even spell. But I must warn you of this. Every time you command me, a little bit_ _more of your soul becomes mine for ever. And when I have all of it, then we shall be one._\n\n'Be one?' Chubby scowled. 'Don't follow you. You mean, like a merger?'\n\nUndulating wavy lines. _hery apt. Imagine a merger between the Mirror group and the Brightlingsea_ Evening Chronicle _and you'll get the general idea._\n\n'Okay.' Chubby's throat was dry, but his palms were wet. 'And if refuse?'\n\n_If I cannot have your soul I shall incinerate your body and fry your brain with lightning_.\n\n'Ah.'\n\n_If you choose quickly, I might be persuaded to throw in a free radio alarm clock_.\n\n'Right. Well, in that case ...'\n\nSo far, he'd had four goes. Each time, the results had been immediate and completely satisfactory. Each time, he hadn't felt any difference at all except that, on the first occasion, he'd been a young, pear-shaped computer programmer living over a chemist's shop and hoping one day he'd meet a nice girl with her own car. Now...\n\n_Your wish is my command_.\n\n'I know. Now listen carefully.'\n**CHAPTER SEVEN**\n\n' **H** ere, you,' said George. 'Nosh for six, quick as you like.' While Father Kelly quivered his acquiescence, George considered the finer points of hospitality. 'Anything your lot can't eat?' he asked. 'On religious grounds, or whatever?'\n\nChardonay shook his head. 'I don't think so,' he replied.\n\n'Perjurers always give me wind, mind,' Slitgrind interrupted, 'unless they're pickled in brimstone. Then, with spring vegetables and a pleasant Niersteiner or—'\n\n'I've got cheese,' Father Kelly replied. 'Or chicken roll.'\n\nSlitgrind sniffed. 'Make it the chicken,' he said. 'Cheese makes you have nightmares.'\n\nFather Kelly stared at him, made a very small high-pitched noise without opening his lips, and fled. George slumped into the armchair and waved his new friends to do likewise.\n\n'So,' ventured Chardonay, after an uncomfortable silence. 'You're a saint.'\n\nGeorge nodded. 'Fully accredited, got my own day and everything.'\n\nAmong the demons, glances were exchanged. 'Um,' Chardonay went on, his face indicating a long time before his mouth opened that he was about to say something that would be difficult to put diplomatically. 'You see, the fact of the matter is—'\n\n'Hang on, I forgot something.' George picked up a heavy alabaster figure of the Holy Virgin and bashed it on the mantelpiece until Father Kelly reappeared. 'We'll need booze as well,' he said. 'What you got?'\n\nWith his eyes shut, the priest started to recite. 'Let me see, now,' he said. 'Spirits, we've got brandy, gin and vodka, Johnny Walker Black Label, Bells, Famous Grouse, The Macallan and Jack Daniels. Beer, there's Guinness, Heineken, Becks, Grolsch, Newcastle Brown or Stella Artois.'\n\n'No Holsten Pils?'\n\n'Sorry.'\n\n'Christ!'\n\nChardonay coughed softly, like a sheep who's just wandered into someone else's hotel room by mistake. 'Actually,' he said, 'a cup of tea will do just fine.'\n\nSlitgrind and Prodsnap began to protest, then they caught Snorkfrod's eye and subsided. George shrugged.\n\n'Please yourselves,' he said. 'Well, don't just stand there, ponce. Jump to it.'\n\nFather Kelly vanished and George turned back to face the demons. 'Sorry,' he said. 'You were saying?'\n\n'We're...' Chardonay swallowed. 'Actually, we're devils. From Hell. I, er, thought you ought to know that before you started, well, giving us things to eat and, er, things.'\n\n'I know,' George replied, puzzled. 'Like I told you, I'm a goddamn saint. We know these things.'\n\n'I see.' Chardonay bit his lip, remembering just too late that he was no longer human and suppressing a yelp of pain. 'Only I thought you might... Well, we are on different sides, so to speak.'\n\n'Bullshit,' George replied crisply, lighting a Lucky Strike and blowing smoke at the ceiling. 'We're on the same side. We're,' he added, crinkling his face with a rather distasteful grin, 'the good guys.'\n\n'I beg your pardon?'\n\n'The white hats,' George amplified, enjoying himself. 'The US Cavalry. The Mounties. Sure, we do different jobs, but we all work for the same Big Guy. Only difference is, I sent the baddies to Hell and you lot keep 'em there. Jeez, I thought you people would have known that.'\n\nThere was a further exchange of glances. Five demons began to say something, but decided at the last moment not to. Eventually, Chardonay inclined his head in a noncommittal nod.\n\n'Point taken,' he said. 'It's just that we thought your lot, I mean saints and angels and so on, were - well, took a less pragmatic view of the situation. After all, there was this war—'\n\n'So?' George chuckled. 'Power struggles, palace coups, nights of the long knives, you get office politics in any big organisation. Doesn't mean that at the end of the day 'you aren't all basically pulling together as a team.'\n\nChardonay sighed. However hard he tried to play angel's advocate, he couldn't fault the logic. 'All right,' he said. 'I agree. But '\n\n'More to the point,' George interrupted, leaning forward and leaking smoke in Chardonay's face, 'what in buggery are you lot doing here? Bit off your patch, aren't you?'\n\n'Ah,' said Chardonay. 'Well.'\n\n'We missed the bus,' said Prodsnap.\n\n'Got left behind on purpose, more like,' Slitgrind grumbled. 'Probably thought it was funny, the pillocks. I'll show them funny.'\n\n'Bus?' George was stroking his chin, his mouth hidden behind his fingers. 'What bus?'\n\n'Works outing,' Prodsnap answered. 'To Nashville.' He sighed. 'The Grand Old Opry. Gracelands ...'\n\nIf George was disconcerted, he did a good job of covering it up. 'Got you,' he said. 'So basically, you're stranded miles outside your jurisdiction, you're going to have to walk back, and if anybody recognises you for what you are, there'll be one hell of an Incident and when you get back you're all going to find yourselves sideways-promoted to mucking out the Great Shit Lakes, right?'\n\nFive demons nodded. Whoever this jerk was, he surely knew the score. Probably, they found themselves speculating, it's pretty much the same Upstairs.\n\nGeorge's grin widened, as though someone were driving wedges into the corners of his mouth. 'But,' he went on, 'suppose that when you got back, you had with you a prisoner. Someone who should've been down your way yonks ago. Let's say, a member of staff of your department who went AWOL a long time ago and never reported for duty. Be a bit different then, wouldn't it?'\n\nThe demons agreed that it would. Very much so.\n\n'Fine,' George said. 'In that case, I think I can help you. Listen up.'\n\n'How?'\n\nThe dragon shrugged. 'There,' he said, 'you have me. Yuk!' he added, pulling a face. 'There's something in this.'\n\nBianca nodded. 'Lead,' she said. 'They put it in to make engines go better.'\n\nScowling, the dragon wiped his mouth on his sleeve, put the cap back on the jerrycan and spat.' Disgusting,' he said. 'Like putting chicory in coffee, or menthol cigarettes. Oh well, never mind. Now then, finding George. I've got to admit, I haven't exactly got what you might call a plan of campaign. You see, I was relying on him coming to find me.'\n\n'You think that's likely?'\n\nFrom the bandstand, a few hundred grassy yards away, came the sound of professional soldiers playing selections from _The Pirates of Penzance._ Children scampered to and fro, trying to cut each others' limbs off with plastic swords. Wasps crooned. In the tree overhead, a squirrel was debating the merits of competing instant-access deposit accounts.\n\n'I thought it was likely. Now I'm not so sure. World's a lot bigger since our day. More people. More buildings. And in the meanwhile, I've got to stay hidden and inconspicuous. Rubbish your modern armaments may be, but I can't spend the rest of eternity swatting jet fighters. Sooner or later, they'll work out a way of nailing me, and that'd be that.'\n\nBianca ate a crisp. 'So you're thinking of packing it all in?' she asked.\n\n'Maybe.' The dragon shrugged. 'Or at the very least, make myself scarce for a while. That's why I tried to get a job. Didn't work out.'\n\nThere was a giggle from Bianca's end of the bench. 'A job?' she said. 'Really?'\n\n'Yes, really. I was a security guard.'\n\n'And it didn't suit?'\n\nThe dragon shook his head. 'And before you start suggesting alternatives,' he went on, 'high on the list of jobs I'm not prepared to consider are such things as self-propelled welding plant, mobile Tandoori oven, late-night hamburger chef or industrial paint stripper. So if that's what you were thinking—'\n\n'Perish the thought.'\n\n'Nor,' continued the dragon ominously, 'would I welcome remarks containing the phrases _bright spark, set the Thames on fire, stepping on the gas or hey, mister, you got a light?_ Understood?'\n\n'Quite. But what are you going to do?' Bianca looked at him. 'I mean, sprawling on park benches under a newspaper with a can of four-star wrapped in brown paper's not going to get you very far, is it?'\n\n'Actually, I quite like meths.'\n\n'Hmm. No,' Bianca went on, standing up and brushing away crumbs, 'this won't do at all. For one thing, what about my statue?'\n\nThe dragon looked at her severely. 'Oh come on,' he said. 'It's traditional. Gentlemen always owe their tailors. Anyway, you should be proud. It's not every chiseller whose stuffs good enough to live in.'\n\n'Be that as it may. I've got a contract and deadlines. It's bad enough that I've got to do Saint George all over again.'\n\n'You're kidding. You seriously expect me to spend the rest of my life sitting still in a public square just to save you a bit of extra work?'\n\nBianca nodded. 'Least you can do,' she replied firmly. 'After all, if it wasn't for me, presumably you'd still be wandering about the astral void, or whatever it was you used to do.'\n\nThe dragon took a long swig of petrol and burped. 'Actually,' he said, 'it wasn't like that at all. I can't remember it all that clearly, because as soon as you cross back into this lot it sort of slips out through the cat-flap of your mind. But I think quite a fair proportion of it was sitting in bars.'\n\n'Figures.'\n\nA frown pinched the dragon's face. 'In fact,' he went on, 'it wasn't bad at all, from what little I can remember. Don't know why I came back to be perfectly honest; job left undone, sense of purpose, something like that. A dripping tap in the bathroom of eternity.'\n\n'Hmm.'\n\nThe dragon stood up. On the one hand, he neither liked nor disliked individual humans, in the same way that humans don't have favourites among blades of grass. On the other hand, this was the longest sustained conversation he'd ever had with one and he was beginning to wonder if, given time, you couldn't get used to them. And if you did, would it matter that you'd spent many happy hours in the long-ago reducing them to more or less pure carbon? It hadn't mattered then, but circumstances change.\n\n'Tell you what I'll do,' he said. 'I'll be your statue until you have to deliver and you get paid. In the meantime, I'll stick with this ridiculous outfit—' He indicated his human body, with a gesture pirated from an Archduke's chauffeur condescending to have a go on the dodgems. 'And you help me to find George. It'll be much easier for you, what with you being a human and all. What do you say?'\n\nBianca considered. 'It sounds fair enough,' she replied. 'Except, I've got to do a new Saint George. That's going to take time.'\n\nThe dragon picked up a chunk of sandwich crust and lobbed it to a passing squirrel. 'Depends,' he replied. 'Maybe I can help you there. Got any sheet iron?'\n\n'Well?'\n\n'Looking good,' the dragon replied. 'Much quicker this way, isn't it?'\n\nBianca nodded. She was exhausted and drenched in sweat. The temperature inside the derelict foundry was murderous.\n\n'Just the sword to do,' she croaked, 'and that's it.'\n\nThey made the sword; that is, Bianca sketched it in chalk on the wall and then took cover. The dragon, back in his true form, then snipped a length off the steel sheet, breathed on it until it was cherry-red and moulded it carefully between his paws, like a child with plasticine. When she was happy with the result, he dunked it in the water tank.\n\n'Anything else you want doing while I'm at it?' he asked. 'Designer tableware? Couple of cell doors? New offside front wing for your car?'\n\n'No, thank you. Can we go now, please? It's rather stuffy in here.'\n\nWith a shrug, the dragon scooped an armful of finished metalwork out of the water tank, knelt down so that Bianca could perch on his shoulder, and took off, vertically, out through where the foundry roof used to be before a catastrophic fire finished off that huge, preservation-order-bound, highly insured edifice. Two minutes later, they were back in Victoria Square. If anybody noticed their arrival, they didn't say anything.\n\n'Fine,' Bianca said, stepping off and doing her best to conceal her total joy at being back on the ground. 'All right, let's see what it looks like.'\n\nThe dragon dumped the metalwork and struck a pose. 'Well?'\n\n'You look ridiculous. Try again.'\n\n'Better?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'Oh. All right, what about this?'\n\nBianca narrowed her eyes. 'The left front knee a bit further in. And let's have a bit more wing. Yes, that's it, hold it right there. That's—'\n\n'Yes, I like it,' murmured the dragon, human once more and standing beside her. 'Apart from looking like a tinned food advert, it's not too bad.'\n\nBianca ignored him. It was ... different. And good.\n\nIt was no longer _Saint George and the Dragon._ It was now _The Dragon Eating Saint George._ To be precise, the dragon, having noshed the juicy bits, was now crunching up the armour in the hope of getting out the last few shreds, like you do with a crab or a lobster (except that you have better table manners). Hence, Bianca realised with a slight shudder, the reference to tins. Never mind.\n\n'That,' said the dragon cheerfully, 'is making me feel distinctly peckish. Fancy a curry?'\n\nNight lay on Birmingham like a lead duvet. A few revellers stumbled through the darkling streets, beer-fuddled, in search of an all-night kebab van. Here and there a doorway or low arch concealed the occasional mugger, rapist or lawyer. Apart from that, the mighty city dozed fitfully.\n\nBirmingham, however, sleeps with the light on. You can read a book by the streetlamps in the city centre, although the chances are that you won't get further than chapter three before someone hits you over the head and steals it. In any event, it's bright enough to make out, say, a small procession consisting of a saint, a priest and five demons, staggering slightly under the weight of three packing cases of plastic explosive, electronic timing devices, blast shields and a drinks trolley.\n\n'Careful,' George hissed, as Chardonay caught his foot in a pothole and tottered. 'You fall over with that lot, there'd be nothing left but a huge hole in the ground and a pile of rubble. Mind you,' he added, looking round, 'in this town I don't suppose anyone'd notice.'\n\n'Sorry,' Chardonay replied. 'Look, is it much further, because my back—'\n\nBefore he could finish the sentence, the crate was snatched from his hands by Snorkfrod, who gave him a dazzling smile and then let George have her opinion of thoughtless pigs who make delicate, sensitive fiends from Hell carry heavy loads. Bloody Shopfloor fire, muttered Chardonay to himself, she's carrying two of those enormous cases under one arm. Tough lady. He shuddered.\n\n'Shut your row,'- George replied. 'Look, it's only just round the next corner.'\n\n'You said that an hour ago,' Slitgrind grumbled, shifting his load onto his shoulder with his middle hand. 'Couple of hundred yards, you said, and—'\n\nGeorge stopped dead and put a tennis-racket-sized hand round the demon's throat. 'You calling me a liar, son?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Huh?'\n\nSlitgrind nodded, insofar as George's hand permitted. 'Yes,' he repeated. 'Just telling the truth. Like my old mum used to say, tell the truth and shame the ... whatever. Always used to wonder whose ruddy side she was on.'\n\n'Oh look,' said Father Kelly. 'I think we're here now.'\n\nGeorge let Slitgrind go. 'Right, lads,' he said. 'Now, you two start packing the jelly round the - fuck me!'\n\nHe was staring at the statue. Quite suddenly, he wasn't feeling very well. Imagine how a turkey would feel, switching on the telly in mid December and catching the Delia Smith programme.\n\nProdsnap nudged him in the back. 'That's it, is it?'\n\nGeorge nodded. 'Bastard,' he added. 'I take that _personally._ '\n\n'And,' Prodsnap went on, 'there's a fair old chance that at any minute that huge great statue could, um, wake up. Yes?'\n\n'Yeah.'\n\nProdsnap studied the dragon for a while. 'I don't think he likes you very much,' he said, backing slowly away. 'In fact, I get the feeling there's definitely a bit of the old needle there.'\n\n'Yeah. There's even more now.'\n\nProdsnap was now standing just behind George's back. 'Looks to me,' he said, 'like this is one of those private quarrels where outsiders butting in only makes things worse. Usually,' he added with a swallow, 'for the outsiders. In fact, I have the feeling we'd all get on a lot better if we just put all this stuff down in a neat pile and went home.'\n\nFingers like roadside cafe sausages closed around his arm. 'Not chickening out, are you?' George breathed quietly. 'What've you got to be afraid of, you cretin? You're immortal. Thumpable,' he added, 'but definitely immortal.'\n\n'Yes,' Prodsnap said, 'well. I've always found that the best way to be immortal is not getting yourself killed, like the best way to avoid divorce is not getting married. I think I'd like to go now, please.'\n\nGeorge snarled. 'Stop whimpering, the lot of you,' he said, his voice more gravelly than a long, posh driveway. 'Anybody gives me any more lip, what's left of him's going to get reported to his CO for dereliction of duty. Understood?'\n\n'We'd better do what he says,' Chardonay said wretchedly. 'After all, it's our duty. And our best chance of getting home.'\n\n'That's right,' said Snorkfrod. 'You listen to Mr C, he's never wrong about these things.' Her knee, Chardonay realised with horror, was rubbing up and down the back of his leg. Scales like sandpaper.\n\n'All right,' Prodsnap grumbled, 'you win. Just don't blame me, that's all.'\n\n'Excuse me.'\n\nSaint George and four demons looked round, then down.\n\n'Excuse me,' said the small demon Holdall, 'but don't you think a very loud bang and lots of bits of rock flying through the air's going to be a bit conspicuous? I thought we were meant to be keeping a low profile.'\n\nThree streets away, a police car dopplered and faded. Someone began to sing _Heard It On The Grapevine,_ but soon ran out of words. The stray sounds vanished into the night, like a wage cheque into a gambler's overdraft.\n\n'Shut up, you.'\n\n'Yes,' Holdall went on, 'but surely there's a better way than just blowing the thing up. Safer, too.'\n\n'Safer?'\n\nHoldall nodded. He was almost completely covered in long, very fine green hair, and as he nodded he looked like nothing so much as an oscillating maidenhair fern. 'Why not just dissolve it?'\n\nGeorge's brow furrowed. 'Dissolve it? How?'\n\nHoldall coughed. 'Ladies present,' he muttered.\n\n'What's this little creep talking about?'\n\n'Well,' said Holdall self-consciously, 'let me see, how can I put this? Why is it, do you think, that in Hell all the staff lavatories are made of solid unflawed diamond? And even then, they've got to be replaced twice a year.'\n\nGeorge's head was beginning to hurt. 'Shut him up, somebody,' he said. 'Right, you with the back-to-front head, pack the stuff round the base, while I—'\n\n'He's right,' said Prodsnap.\n\n'Much quieter,' Chardonay agreed. \"Plus, less damage to property, risk to innocent bystanders from flying masonry. Let's face it,' the demon added, 'letting off bombs in the centre of a big city is pretty damn irresponsible.'\n\n'Look—'\n\n'Just a second,' grunted Slitgrind. 'What if that bloody great thing wakes up while we're peeing all over him? He's not going to be pleased.'\n\nProdsnap scowled. 'Maybe,' he said. 'On the other hand, he might be even less pleased if he catches us festooning him with ruddy Semtex. I'm with whatsisname, Holdall on this one. Vote, people?'\n\n'Vote!' George rolled his eyes. 'This is an assassination, not a debating society.'\n\n'Show of claws,' Chardonay said quickly. 'All in favour\n\n... That's unanimous. Now then.' He grinned nervously. 'What we need is something to drink.'\n\n'I have a problem.'\n\n_Two problems._\n\n'All right,' Chubby said, 'two problems. So I need two answers. Any joy?'\n\n_You, my soulmate, are in trouble._\n\n'Listen,' Chubby sighed, 'I'm in trouble so often I have a flat there. What can I do about it?'\n\nThe screen went blank, then filled with question marks. That, Chubby recognised, meant it was thinking.\n\n_Simple. You need help._\n\n'I don't want to sound ungrateful,' Chubby said, 'but I could have got that far asking the speaking clock. Details, please.'\n\n_There is a dragon. Give him a job._\n\nChubby frowned. 'And which bit of my soul are you going to charge me for that particular gem?' he said. 'I think you've just earned yourself the bit I use for doing my tax returns. Enjoy.'\n\n_Patience. In Birmingham, which is a city in the English Midlands, there is a dragon. He's there to find and kill a saint. Dragons are_ ...\n\nThe screen filled with question marks, then asterisks. Chubby leaned back in his chair, his chin cupped between his hands. 'Are what?'\n\n_Different._\n\n'Different? How different?'\n\nSquare brackets this time, followed by exclamation marks, ampersands and Greek Es. All this was new to Chubby. He was interested.\n\n'How do you do that?' he asked. 'Press E plus EXTRA?'\n\n_Different, because they don't - I find this an extremely difficult concept, I must admit._ I _had forgotten all about dragons. It's been a long time._\n\n'A long time since what?'\n\n_Never you mind. I think I can explain. Angels and devils are spirits, emanations from the mind of God. Human beings and all the other animate species who inhabit Earth are spirits too, but made flesh. In their duality, God makes the great experiment, plays the everlasting game._\n\n'With you so far. So what are dragons?'\n\n_Very large reptiles._\n\nChubby sighed. 'I know that,' he said. 'I had a Ladybird book all about them. But what else?'\n\n_Nothing else. That's why they're different. And, of course, incredibly valuable._\n\nAll his life, Chubby had found a music sweeter than a thousand violins in the word _valuable._ He leaned forward.\n\n'Amplify,' he said.\n\n_Very well. Think of the neutrality of Switzerland_ —\n\n'Nice place, Switzerland. I love the way they run things there.'\n\n_The neutrality of Switzerland, the mentality of Ireland and the military might of Russia, America and China put together. Look at it another way; because dragons don't exist any more, no allowance is made for them in the Great Equation. They are neither flesh nor spirit, us or them, good or evil. They just are. The same goes, incidentally, for the Milkweed butterfly of southern America, except that Milkweed butterflies don't wipe out major cities when they sneeze._\n\n'Just a moment. I thought dragons were evil.'\n\n_Not intrinsically. Call them floating voters, if you like. Besides, what is evil?_\n\n'Well, you are, for a start.'\n\n_True. But I'm exceptional. And, don't forget, I'm also stuck in this nasty cramped little plastic box._\n\nChubby closed his eyes and thought for a moment. 'We're getting side-tracked,' he said. 'How can a dragon be useful to me?'\n\n_First, they can fly faster than light. Second, they can kill saints and vaporise demons. Third, they can be hired for money._\n\n'I see. Lots of money?'\n\n_Traditionally, they sleep in caves on heaps of gold and precious stones._\n\n'This is some kind of health fad, right? Like those car seat covers made out of knobbly wooden beads?'\n\n_Greed. A physical lust for wealth. That's the traditional view, anyway. Times have changed. Maybe dragons have changed too._\n\nSuddenly, Chubby felt tired; more tired, even, than interested or frightened. 'All right,' he said. 'How do I get in touch with this dragon? Can I talk to him? Will he accept Pay-As-You-Burn, or will he want a princess on account?'\n\n_If you want me to answer that, it will count as a separate enquiry_\n\n'Goodnight, machine.'\n\n_Any time._\n\nThe green light faded. Chubby stood up, found that his legs had somehow lost their rigidity and sat down again. Talking to that thing always made him feel like he'd been trapped in a spin-drier.\n\nNot so long ago, he'd passed a computer shop. Special deal, its window had shouted to him, part exchange, any model accepted. He'd been tempted. But would It let him? And even if It did, did he really want to? After all, the damage was probably done by now. Highly unlikely that you could regrow a damaged soul, like a slow-worm's tail.\n\nBefore he left the office he stopped in front of a mirror and looked in.\n\n'Hey,' he asked. 'Are you evil?'\n\nThe picture in the mirror said nothing.\n\n'Lousy copycat,' Chubby grumbled, and switched off the light.\n\nHalfway through his lamb pasanda, the dragon dropped his fork and choked.\n\n'Rice gone down the wrong way?' Bianca asked with her mouth full. 'Try a drink of water.'\n\nThe dragon spluttered, convulsed and fell off his chair. Bianca, who usually had the lamb pasanda but this time had opted for a chicken korma, summoned a waiter.\n\n'I think my friend needs a doctor,' she said. 'Or maybe a vet. Call both. And,' she added, 'then get me another peshwari nan.'\n\nWith a tremendous effort, the dragon hauled himself back onto his chair. Drawing in breath was as difficult as pulling in a trawl-net full of lead ingots, and his hands were shaking uncontrollably.\n\n'What's happening to me?' he gasped. 'I feel like I'm being burned alive.'\n\n'Oh,' said Bianca, relaxing a little. 'We call that lime pickle. It's quite usual.'\n\nThis time, the dragon's spasm sent him rolling on the floor, taking the table and the coat rack with him. Smoke was pouring out of holes in his shoes and there was a quite repulsive smell. Bianca was on her feet, very much aware that there was absolutely nothing she could usefully do.\n\n'The statue,' the dragon hissed, spending each atom of breath as if he was a dentist buying magazines for the waiting room. 'Run. It has to be George.'\n\nSlamming her credit card on the next-door table - damn, she thought, forgot the tip; but the rice was stone cold, so what the hell? - Bianca ran out into the street and headed for Victoria Square. If anybody was fooling with her statue, there'd be hell to pay.\n\nIt's difficult, isn't it, to do it to order. Think of the trouble you have filling a small bottle behind a screen at the doctor's. Then imagine a life-size statue of a dragon.\n\n'I find it helps to think of running water,' said Chardonay, his nose wrinkled against the offensive smell. 'Gushing taps. Chortling brooks. Waterfalls.'\n\n'Shut up, Char, you're not helping.'\n\n'Milky tea works best in my experience,' said Holdall.\n\n'Goes straight through me, especially first thing in the morning.' For what it's worth, Holdall had contributed more than the others put together, thereby confirming the view that Prodsnap had formed of him a few moments after they'd first met. There was now a hole in the dragon's back left paw you could have hidden a cottage loaf in.\n\n'This,' George grunted, 'is stupid. I'm going to get the explosives.'\n\nChardonay looked down at the small crater in the marble directly underneath where he was standing. 'Maybe you're right,' he conceded. 'Otherwise, we're going to be here all night. And it doesn't seem like there's much risk now of the horrid thing waking up.'\n\nProdsnap nodded. 'And what about the noise?' he said. 'Not that I'm arguing with you,' he added quickly, for it wasn't exactly a warm night and he was sure he'd pulled a muscle. 'But if there is anything we can do to keep the volume down, it'd be worth the effort. Something tells me that passing it off as a car backfiring won't really do.'\n\n'Cover it with the blast shield and hope,' George replied. 'In any case, so long as we don't hang about too long afterwards, a bit of a bang'll be neither here nor there. Trust me, I'm a saint.'\n\nIt didn't take the seven of them long to get the explosive in position, and George made light work of wiring up the detonators. Father Kelly, who hadn't really been able to contribute to the previous attempt, helped by passing George screwdrivers and, to the great irritation of all present, praying.\n\n'Okay, lads,' said George, lifting the plunger. 'Firework time. Stand clear or prepare to fly.'\n\n'What the hell do you goons think you're doing with my statue?'\n\nGeorge looked over his shoulder to see a tall, angry-looking female with her hands on her hips and an expression on her face you could have built a thriving yoghurt business around. He scowled.\n\n'Piss off, lady,' he snapped. Then he remembered.\n\n'You!' Bianca said. 'Right.'\n\nBear in mind that George was a saint and had been a knight. Saints and knights do not fight with women. It's unchivalrous. More to the point, they generally lose. Still holding the detonator box by the handle, he started to back away.\n\n'Help!' he said.\n\nDemons and the denizens of Hell, on the other hand, have no such scruples, particularly if they outnumber the woman five to one. The demons advanced.\n\n'Madam,' said Chardonay, mister play-it-by-the-book, 'I have to inform you that we are duly authorised law officers in the execution of our duty. If you obstruct us, you will be committing an offence punishable by - oh shit!'\n\nHe had trodden on Slitgrind's tail; a lanky, unpleasant object, having a lot in common with a banana skin. He wobbled and tried to grab hold of the fiend next to him, but he was standing beside Holdall, four foot one in his stocking talons. His heels slid out from under him, and he fell -\n\n\\- Heavily, against George, who was off-balance anyway trying to hide behind Snorkfrod. A moment later, there was a confused heap of demons, and a click. George would have landed awkwardly, but the plunger of the detonator box broke his fall.\n\nThere was a very loud noise.\n**CHAPTER EIGHT**\n\n**'W** here am I?'\n\nChubby smiled. 'You're safe,' he said. 'I rescued you from certain death. Look upon me as your personal knight in shining armour.' He checked himself. 'Let me rephrase that,' he said. 'Your guardian angel.'\n\n'You mean you're out to get me?'\n\nChubby sighed. There are times when you want to have the niceties of combat theology explained to you, and there are other times when you just want to go to bed. 'I mean,' he said, 'I want to offer you a job.'\n\n'We killed him,' Chardonay said.\n\n'Apparently,' George replied. 'Calls for a celebration, I reckon. Hey, Padre, we got any bubbly?'\n\n'But that was murder,' Chardonay replied uncomfortably: 'Wasn't it?'\n\n'Pesticide. Where the hell's that bloody vicar got to with the drinkies?'\n\n'You're a saint and you _killed_ him. Without provocation.\n\nHe wasn't setting fire to anything or eating maidens, he was just sitting there.'\n\n'Yeah,' George snarled, his feet up on the coffee table; size twelve Doc Martens resting on disused _Catholic Heralds._ 'Eating me in effigy. Charming. Anyway, bugger that. We're on the same side, remember.'\n\nChardonay shook his head. 'I still don't really buy that,' he said. 'That's like saying good and evil are basically the same thing.'\n\nGeorge, who had never been near a university common room bar in his life but could nevertheless sense the onset of one of those ghastly serious-conversations-about-the-meaning-of-Everything, got up and opened the drinks cabinet with his foot. 'Bollocks,' he said, knocking the top off a Guinness bottle against the mantelpiece. 'That's like saying Accounts is the same as the Packing Department. They're different, yes, but part of the same firm.'\n\n'Oh. I thought we were, you know, at war, sort of thing. Evil versus Good. In competition for the soul of man.'\n\n'Listen, pillock. If Evil won, it'd become Good, like the opposition becomes the government.' He glugged at the bottle until it was empty and dropped it in the fireplace. 'Thought you were meant to be a management trainee, son. Don't they teach you boys anything?'\n\nFather Kelly peered nervously round the door and whispered that he'd got a bottle of champagne, if that's what they wanted. He looked nervous and semi-martyred; Terry Waite in his own home. Which suited him fine, because although he'd always reckoned he'd have made a cracking hostage he spoke no foreign languages and air travel gave him migraines. 'And,' he added, 'there's a devil in the washing machine.'\n\n'That'll be that Holdall,' George grunted. 'I told him to search the place, see where you're hiding the good stuff.'\n\n'Um.' Father Kelly wasn't sure what good meant any more, but from the context he guessed alcohol. 'Actually,' he said, 'I haven't got any more. I can send out Mrs McNamara if you—'\n\nGeorge made a scornful noise. 'You don't fool me that easily,' he said. 'In my day, first thing your priest did when he saw a gang of saints on the horizon, he put all the grog in a bucket and lowered it down the well. Always used to confess, though, specially when we told him we'd chuck him down after it. That,' he added stonily, 'is a hint.'\n\n'Actually, I haven't got a well.'\n\n'I can improvise.'\n\nFather Kelly gulped and bolted. George listened after his retreating footsteps and winked.\n\n'He'll be back in ten minutes with a couple of crates, you mark my words.' he said. 'Where was I?'\n\n'Good and Evil.'\n\n'Yeah. Them.' George yawned, stretched and kicked his shoes off. 'All a bit academic, really. I mean, what it all boils down to is, you see a dragon, say, wandering about on your patch, you scrag it, job done. What more d'you need to know, for Chrissakes? I mean, it's not exactly brain-bending stuff. Not like your angels dancing on the head of a pin - to which, in case you ever wondered, the answer is six, unless they're doing the valeta, in which case eight. I don't see what you're making all this fuss about.'\n\nChardonay shrugged helplessly. 'I don't know,' he said. 'Maybe I'm not right for this line of work after all. When I joined, I thought there'd be something, you know, non-controversial I could do, like keeping the books, doing budget forecasts, working out cost-efficiency ratios and calculating depreciation of fixed assets on a straight-line basis. Killing people ...'\n\nGeorge treated him to a look of contemptuous pity.\n\n'Wouldn't do if we were all the same, son. I mean, if we were then the likes of me couldn't kick shit out of the likes of you, for starters. Here,' he added irritably, 'this isn't proper champagne, it's that naff Italian stuff. When that dozy parson gets back, I've a good mind to pour the rest of it down his trousers. One thing I can't stand, it's blasphemy.'\n\n'What?'\n\n'Grapes,' said Mike, smiling. 'Flowers. Womens' magazines. I know you hate them all like the plague, so I'm building up an environment you'll be desperate to leave. That way, you'll get well faster.'\n\nBianca tried to rub her eyes, but found she couldn't, because her arm was cocooned in plaster and hanging by a wire from a frame above her head. 'I'm in hospital, right?' she said.\n\n'Huh.' Mike scowled. 'Someone must have told you.'\n\n'How did I get here?'\n\n'You got blown up,' Mike replied through a mouthful of grape-pulp. 'Along, I'm very sorry to have to tell you, with your statue. Note the singular, by the way. There's bits of marble dragon scattered about as far as Henley-in-Arden, but no Saint George. They're saying it's the animal rights lot.'\n\nSuddenly there was something solid and awkward in Bianca's throat; possibly a bit of dragon shrapnel. 'The statue's - gone, then?'\n\nMike nodded. 'All the king's horses are reported to have packed it in as a lost cause,' he replied. 'All the king's men are still at it, but only because they're paid hourly. If it's any consolation, you're in all the papers and there's a guy from _Celebrity Squares_ in the waiting room right now.'\n\nWhat with the plaster and the wires, Bianca couldn't sink back into the pillows with a hollow groan, so she did the next best thing and swore eloquently. Mike agreed that it was a pity.\n\n'A _pity?_ They murdered the - my statue, and you say it's a pity?'\n\n'These things happen. Is there anything else you're particularly allergic to that I can bring in? I seem to remember you can't stand chrysanthemums, but they'd sold out at the kiosk, so I got daffs instead.'\n\n'Mike.'\n\n'Yes?'\n\n'Go away.'\n\n'I thought you'd say that,' Mike said, and left.\n\nThe dragon looked down, then back over his shoulder. Cautiously, he spread his wings and folded them again. Finally, he breathed out the tiniest, finest plume of flame he could manage, so as not to incinerate the extremely plush office he was apparently sitting in.\n\n'All present and correct,' Chubby said. 'Actually, in all the panic we knocked off a toe, but we put it back on with Araldite as soon as we got here and it seems to have taken okay. Grateful?'\n\nThe dragon nodded. 'Extremely,' he said. 'I had the distinct impression I was dying. I was in this restaurant, and then I was in the square again, inside the statue. I thought—'\n\n'They tried to blow you up,' Chubby replied. 'I got there just as a fat bloke with a moustache tripped over his feet and fell on the plunger. A sixth of a second later and all you'd have been fit for would have been lining the bottom of goldfish bowls.'\n\nThe dragon narrowed his eyes. 'So what happened?' he said. 'What did you do?'\n\nChubby shrugged modestly and folded his hands in his lap. 'A sixth of a second can be a very long time,' he said, 'especially if you boost another twelve hours into it using a state-of-the-art Kawaguchiya Heavy Industries Temporal Jack.' He grinned. 'At $3,000,000 per hour plus hire of plant and equipment, you owe me plenty, but we'll sort that out later. Anyway, during that time we winched your statue up off the deck and into the cargo bay of the big Sikorsky, substituted a big chunk of solid marble, and legged it. That way, when the fireworks started, there were plenty of bits of flying rock to make them think they'd succeeded. To them, of course, the sixth of a second lasted a sixth of a second, thanks to the KHI jack and a quick whip round with the soldering iron. Neat, yes?'\n\n'Rather. I'm impressed. It was very good thinking.'\n\n'Yes,' said Chubby, 'well. Some of us don't go all to pieces at the first sign of trouble. And now, here you are, safe and sound. And, I sincerely hope, desperately anxious to try and repay the colossal debt of gratitude, ditto money, you now owe me. Correct?'\n\nThe dragon nodded. 'You said something about a job.'\n\n'Ah yes. Two jobs, really. Both of them right up your alley. Can I get you a drink, by the way? I've got four-star, diesel, aviation fuel or ethanol, and I think there's a drop of turps left over from the Christmas party.'\n\nThe dragon asked for a large ethanol, straight, no cherry. 'Two jobs,' he repeated. 'Connected?'\n\n'Sort of,' Chubby replied. 'One, I want you to fry me some devils. Two, I - _Don't touch that!'_\n\nHe was too late. The dragon, a born fidget, had let his claws drift across the keyboard of the obsolete old PCW The screen started to glow.\n\n'Sorry,' the dragon said. 'Oh look, it's gone all green.'\n\n_Your wish is my - Well, hello, Fred._\n\nThe dragon blinked. 'Nosher?'\n\n_Fred, mate, it's great to see you again. Nice outfit._\n\n'Likewise.' The dragon grinned, and only just managed to restrain a sigh of pleasure that would have melted the side off the building. 'It's been a long time, Nosher. What, three thousand years?'\n\n_Easily that. How've you been keeping?_\n\n'Well,' the dragon replied, 'most of the time I've been dead, though I'm better now. And yourself?'\n\nChubby, his eyes round as tennis balls, could contain himself no longer. 'Nosher?' he demanded. 'Your name is _Nosher_?'\n\n_Zagranosz. And this is my old friend Fredegundar. We go way back_.\n\n'I trust,' said Chubby bitterly, 'that none of this great-to-see-you-heard-from-Betsy-lately stuff's going on my account. I mean, I don't mind soul-destroying _work,_ but college reunions—'\n\n_On the house. He worries, you know._\n\nThe dragon nodded. 'Weird sort of a bloke,' he agreed, 'although he did just save me from getting blown up. And now he wants me to go torching demons.'\n\n_Ah._\n\nThe dragon blinked. 'You know about this?'\n\n_Well, yes. Of course, I never guessed the dragon'd turn out to be you._\n\nConfused, and feeling as left out as an empty milk bottle, Chubby finished off the dragon's ethanol and wiped his mouth on his sleeve. 'You guys,' he said. 'It's no good, I've got to know. Where do you two know each other from?'\n\nThe dragon turned his head and smiled.\n\n'Sunday school,' he said.\n\nDrop a pebble in the sea off Brighton and the ripples will eventually reach California. Likewise, blow up a statue in Birmingham and you risk starting a revolution.\n\nA lot depends, of course, on the quality of the statue, because only the very best statues have the potential to be squatted in by unquiet spirits. The word _unquiet,_ by the way, has been chosen with great care.\n\nThe sound waves travelled fastest, of course; followed by the shock of air suddenly and violently displaced, in turn hotly pursued by microscopic fragments of dust and debris. The sound and the air dissipated themselves soon enough, but the dust floated on, carried on the winds far over the English Channel, south-east across France and down into Italy. Most of it fell by the wayside, to be whisked away by conscientious housewives or ploughed under; but one stray particle happened to drift into the great and glorious Academy Gallery in the city of Florence, where they keep possibly the most famous statue in the world - Michaelangelo's _David._\n\nImagine that there's a wee video camera mounted on the back of this dust particle - impossible, of course; even the latest twelfth-generation salt-grain-sized Kawaguchiya Optical Industries P7640 would be far too big and heavy - and you're watching the city come into focus as the particle begins its unhurried descent. Now we're directly over the Piazzale Michelangiolo, where the coaches park for a good gawp and an ice lolly; we can see the khaki majesty of the river Arno, the Ponte Vecchio with its bareback shops, the grim tower of the Bargello, the egg-headed Duomo. Here is the square horseshoe of the Academy. Here is an open window, saving us 4,000 lire entrance fee. And here is the statue.\n\nIt stands at the end of a gallery, in an alcove shaped like half an Easter egg. No miniature, this; twelve feet from curly hair to imperious toe, leaning slightly backwards, weight on his right foot, one hand by his side and the other holding what looks uncommonly like a sock over his left shoulder. There are those who'll tell you his head and hands are too big, out of proportion to the rest of him; that his hair looks like an old woolly mop head, fallen on the unsuspecting youth from a great height. Be that as it may, the consensus of civilised opinion holds that you are in the presence of transcendent genius, so be told.\n\nThe grain of dust flittered casually down and settled on David's nose.\n\nHe sneezed.\n\n'Nngr,' he mumbled, the way you do after a real corker of a sneeze. Absent-mindedly, he moved to wipe his nose with the thing that looks like a sock and found he couldn't. Shit, he thought, my arm's stuck.\n\nAlso, he observed, horrified, there's a whole gaggle of people over there staring at me _and I haven't got any clothes on._\n\nNot a happy state of affairs for a well-brought-up twelve-footer who can't move. My God, he asked himself, how long have I been here like this? I can't remember. In fact, I can't remember _anything._ I must have been in a terrible accident, which left me completely paralysed and amnesiac. Oh _God!_\n\nExcept, the train of thought chuntered on, blowing its whistle and slowing down while a cow crossed the line, if I'd just had a terrible accident, surely I'd be in a hospital with nurses and lots of bits of tube sticking out of me, rather than standing in this very public place, stark naked. So just what is going on here?\n\n'Hello,' said the grain of dust.\n\nIt spoke quietly, in statue language. Don't, by the way, rush out and try and buy the Linguaphone tape because there isn't one, not even in HMV And even if there was, a twelve-year-old child would be a hundred and six before he'd got as far as _What are you called? My name is John,_ because statue language takes a long time to learn and almost as long to say.\n\n'Hello,' David replied, puzzled. 'Where are you?'\n\n'On the end of your nose. There's ever such a good view from up here.'\n\nDavid felt his nose begin to itch again. 'Okay. What are you?'\n\n'I'm a bit of dust from Birmingham. It's nicer here than Birmingham. What's your name?'\n\n'I don't know,' David confessed. 'I don't think I know anything before you landed on my nose. It was you, wasn't it?'\n\n'Sorry about that. I just sort of drifted, if you know what I mean.'\n\nHow the hell, David wondered, can you itch if you're immobile? 'Look,' he said, 'can you tell me what's going on? For a start, why can't I move?'\n\n'You're a statue.'\n\n'Don't be thick, statues are dead. I mean, not alive. Inanimate.'\n\n'Oh are they, now? Well, I've got news for you, buster. Not only are some statues alive, they also walk about and talk and do all sorts of things. I guess,' the dust mused, 'it's all a matter of casting off crippling social stereotypes and unlocking your full potential.'\n\n'How do you know?'\n\n'Because,' the dust replied smugly, 'I've seen it, that's why. Where I've just come from, there was this enormous big statue of a dragon. Alive as anything, it was. Until they blew it up, of course.'\n\n'What!'\n\n'With dynamite, or something. Well, they tried to, anyway. At the last moment someone swapped me for it, me as I was, that is. I was bigger then.'\n\nIf David had had skin, it'd have goosepimpled. 'They blew up a statue because it was alive?' he demanded nervously.\n\n'I suppose so. Can't see why else they'd want to do a thing like that, can you? I mean, statues aren't cheap, you don't just go around blasting them to smithereens because you quite fancy turning the vegetable patch into a rockery.'\n\n'Good God.' David glanced out of the corner of his eye at the knot of people at the end of the gallery. They were quite definitely staring at him. Had they guessed? 'This is terrible. I must get out of here at once.'\n\n'Go on then.'\n\n'I can't. My bits don't work. Oh Christ, there's a guy over there with some sort of box, do you think...?'\n\n'The other statue seemed to manage okay. You can't be doing it right.'\n\nDavid tried again; still nothing. 'All right,' he said, 'if you're so clever, _how do_ you do this movement stuff? I assumed it just sort of happened when you wanted it to.'\n\n'Search me,' replied the dust particle. 'I think it's something to do with the central nervous system. You got one of those?'\n\n'How should I know? You think I've got a zip somewhere I can undo and take a peek? Besides, even if I did I wouldn't be able to use it.'\n\nA gang of humans, all women, led by a big loud-voiced specimen with an umbrella, were walking down the gallery towards him. This is it, he told himself, the lynch mob. Well, having my entire life flash before my eyes isn't going to be a problem, because the ruddy thing's only lasted about two minutes. On the other hand, there's not much of it I'd really want to see twice.\n\n'All right,' said the dust particle. 'Try falling over.'\n\n'What?'\n\n'Look down. Feel giddy. You're losing your balance. You're teetering. You're going to fall. _Look out!_ '\n\nThe statue staggered, clutched at thin air, wobbled backwards and forwards for a split second and fell off its plinth with a crash. If people had been staring before, it was peanuts compared to the way they were staring now.\n\n'Hell's teeth,' groaned the statue. 'I banged my head.'\n\n'Worked, though, didn't it? Come on.'\n\nWithout knowing how, or what it was he'd done to bring it about, David found himself scrambling to his feet, jelly-legged as a newborn calf. He remembered something, scooped up the thing that looked like a sock, and held it with both hands over his groin.\n\n'Which way?' he hissed. 'Quick!'\n\nBut there was no reply. He must, he realised, have displaced the speck of dust, his only friend and guide in this terrible, unfamiliar, murderous world. He whimpered and began to back away until the wall stopped him. At the first touch of something cold on his bare shoulder-blades he squealed like a scalded pig, jumped in the air and dropped the sock. Then he grabbed it again and looked for an exit.\n\nThere wasn't one. The only way out was through, or over, the lynch mob. Just as he was toying with the idea of crouching down behind the plinth and hoping they'd overlook him, a vagrant thought hit him and exploded in his brain like a rocket.\n\nHey, he said to himself. I'm bigger than them.\n\nSix floors below, in the gallery's engine room, a breathless guard burst in through the door marked VIETATO INTRARI PERICOLO DI MORTI and slithered to a halt in front of a broad mahogany desk.\n\n'Chief ! Chief!' he panted. 'It's the _David,_ it's come to frigging _life!'_\n\nBehind the desk, a large, stocky man with very hairy arms stubbed out a cigarette.\n\n'Oh balls,' he sighed. 'Not another one.'\n\n'Honestly, Chief, straight up, I saw it with my own - What do you mean, another one?'\n\nThe Chief stood up and unlocked a steel cabinet behind him. 'You haven't been here long, have you, son?'\n\n'Six months, Chief. You mean to say it's—?'\n\n'On average,' the Chief replied, opening the cabinet door, 'once every five years or so. Lately though, there's been a poxy epidemic. Here, catch hold of this.'\n\nInto the guard's quivering hands the Chief pressed a big tranquilliser gun and a bandolier of darts. For his part, he chose a slide-action Mossberg twelve-gauge, a pocketful of armour-piercing slugs and a geologist's hammer. Finally, a tin hat each, goggles and a torch.\n\n'The _David,_ you say?'\n\n'Yes, Chief.'\n\n'Fuck. It's always the thoroughbreds. Anonymous figure of unknown man, late fifteenth-century Venetian school, never get a whisper out of them. Right, let's go.'\n\nThe Chief walked so fast that the guard was hard pressed to keep up with him. 'What we gonna do, Chief?' he gasped.\n\n'Well.' The Chief shrugged. 'Sometimes, a couple of sleepy-darts knock'em out cold, and then all we have to do is drill out their brains and fill up with quick-drying resin. Other times,' he added grimly, jacking a round into the breech of the shotgun, 'we have to get a bit more serious.'\n\n'Serious?'\n\nThe Chief nodded. 'How d'you think the _Venus_ de _Milo_ got that way, son? Resisting arrest? Had a bad fall in her cell? Act your age.'\n\nWhen they got to the gallery, it had already been roped off and the doors were shut. Two-way radios crackled and white-faced guards stepped back to let the Chief through.\n\n'Any movement?' he demanded.\n\nA guard nodded. 'It chased all the visitors out,' he said, 'threw a couple of glass cases at them. We've sealed all the exits so it's not going anywhere, but it looks like it's in a mean mood.'\n\nThe Chief grimaced. 'We'll see about that. There's no room for frigging wild men in _my museum._ Okay, going in!'\n\nHe applied his boot to the door, which opened inwards. A fraction of a second later, his knife-edge reflexes propelled him backwards, just in time to avoid an airborne bronze bust, which would have reduced him to the consistency of strawberry jam had it connected. He slammed the door quickly.\n\n'Fuck me,' he said, 'it's gone bloody berserk. Of course, doesn't help that it's one of the really big buggers. You get thirteenth-century Sienese ivory miniatures running about the place, all it takes is five minutes and a stiff broom.' He hesitated, then turned to the head porter.\n\n'Get me a bullhorn,' he ordered. 'Evacuate the museum, then get on the red phone to the army, Special Art Service. Tell 'em unless they get their bums in gear, it'll be the Wallace Collection all over again.'\n\nWhen the bullhorn came, the Chief tested it to make sure it worked; then, using a broom handle, he poked the door open a crack and waited. Nothing.\n\n'You in the gallery!' he shouted. 'Come out with your hands up and nobody's gonna get broken. You hear me?'\n\nSilence.\n\n'You've got till ten to give yourself up, then we come in. One.'\n\n'Hey!'\n\nA high-pitched voice, the Chief noted, ear-splittingly sonorous but basically reedy and terrified. But those are often the most dangerous. His mind went back to the early days, the time he'd had to talk down the Elgin Marbles. Maybe, he said to himself, I'm getting too old for all this.\n\n'I hear you,' he replied.\n\n'I've got the _Pietà, Saint Matthew_ and a big bimbo provisionally attributed to Giovanni Bellini,' yelled the voice. 'You come in here and they all get it. Understood?'\n\n'Loud and clear, son, loud and clear.' He frowned and switched off the loudhailer. 'Was it just the _David,'_ he asked, 'or were any of the rest of them at it as well?'\n\n'Not that I saw, Chief,' replied the guard. 'Just the big guy.'\n\n'Hmm.' The Chief rubbed his chin. 'Thought you said he was acting confused, like he didn't know what was going on.'\n\n'Looked like that to me, Chief.'\n\n'Yeah. Only now he sounds like he's pretty well clued up. Like, the big bimbo, I mean the _Venus di San Lorenzo,_ the attribution to Bellini was only in last month's _Fine Art Yearbook._ Somebody's in there with him.'\n\n'You on the outside!'\n\nThe Chief ducked down. Behind him, thin young men with wavy hair, black silk Giorgio Armani jump-suits, Gucci balaclavas and bazookas were filing noiselessly into the corridor. The Chief waved them into position and switched on the bullhorn.\n\n'Receiving you, over.'\n\n'Here's the deal—'\n\n'Different voice,' muttered the head porter.\n\n'Yeah,' replied the Chief. 'Shuttup.'\n\n'Here's the deal. We want no guns, no police, no army. Have a Sikorski airfreighter in the Piazza in thirty minutes. We want ten million dollars in uncut diamonds, clearance to land in Tripoli and a free pardon. Do as we say and the rocks walk.'\n\n'Actually,' interrupted another voice.\n\n('That's him.'\n\n'Who?'\n\n_'David.'_\n\n'Yeah. Shuttup.')\n\n'Actually,' said the second voice, 'they don't. Do they? And anyway, haven't you got to fall over first?'\n\nThis exchange was followed by several seconds of heated whispering, which the Chief couldn't quite catch. By the time they'd brought up the boom mikes, the debate had ended.\n\n'Okay, guys,' muttered the Chief, 'here's the plan. You boys go round the side, abseil in through the skylight. Use smoke grenades and thunderflashes. You six come with me, in through the door. I'll cover the _David_ , you take out the other sucker, whoever the fuck he is. Remember,' he added gravely, thinking of the high velocity bronze bust, 'they're presumed armed—'\n\n'Busted.'\n\n'—Busted and dangerous, so if there's any hint of trouble, get your shot in first and let the guys with the dustpans and glue sort it out later. Ready?'\n\nTwelve balaclava'd heads nodded.\n\n'Right then. On my command.'\n\nIt was a grand spectacle, if you like that sort of thing. _Crash!_ went the glass roof. _Whoosh!_ went the smoke bombs. _BANG!_ went the stun grenades. _Crunch!_ went the big oak doors. _Boom!_ went the bazookas, reducing to fine-grain rubble two half-length statues of constipated-looking goddesses, no loss by anybody's standards, and a somewhat less than genuine della Robbia rood screen which had been a thorn in the gallery's side ever since someone had noticed the words _Made In Pakistan From Sustainable Hardwoods_ chiselled round the back.\n\nAnd _Oh shit, where've they gone_? went the Chief, standing gobsmacked by two empty pedestals. The birds had, apparently, flown.\n\nIn the confusion, nobody noticed that the commando squad had, apparently, recruited two new members during the course of the attack; one tall, athletic-looking specimen, rather unsteady on his feet, and one short, bandy-legged example given to lurking in shadows. While the gallery was still full of smoke, shouting and the joyous sound of hobnailed boot on irreplaceable artefact, these two new recruits slipped quietly past the guards, down the corridor and, having shed their masks and swiped a couple of overcoats from the cleaners' room, out into the street.\n\n'Yo!' exclaimed the shorter of the two, punching the air. 'We made it!'\n\n'Yes,' David replied. 'Didn't we just.' He stopped and looked at his companion, and a puzzled look swept across his face. 'Excuse me.'\n\n'Yeah?'\n\n'Who _are_ you?'\n**CHAPTER NINE**\n\n**'W** hat the fuck do you mean,' George screamed into the telephone, 'not arrived?'\n\n'I mean,' replied the arrivals clerk at Hell Central, 'it hasn't arrived yet. If it had arrived, it'd be on the manifest. And it isn't.'\n\n'You sure?'\n\nIt wasn't a stupendously good line - think what it had to go through to get there - but George could still hear the long intake of breath, the sound of someone who spends her working life with a phone in her ear, suffering fools.\n\n'Sir,' she said, 'if we'd just taken delivery of a dragon, I think we'd have noticed. They are rather distinctive.'\n\nGeorge used his left hand to push his lower jaw, which had dropped somewhat, back into position. 'Are you trying to tell me,' he demanded, 'that the fucker's gone to the _other_ place?'\n\n'I can check that for you if you'd like me to.'\n\n'What? Oh, yeah. Please.'\n\n'Hold the line.'\n\nChardonay, leaning over George's shoulder, mouthed the question; _What's wrong?_\n\n'Some admin balls-up,' George replied, his hand over the mouthpiece. 'Nothing to worry about—Oh, hello. Well?'\n\n'Not there, sir. I'm sorry.'\n\nGeorge had gone ever such a funny colour. 'You can't have checked properly, you stupid cow!'\n\n'I'm not a cow, sir,' replied the clerk, icily. 'I am, in fact, half-human, half-goat, with the claws of an eagle and—'\n\n'All right. Thank you.' George let the receiver click back onto its cradle. A moment later, Father Kelly (who'd been listening in on the extension, stopwatch in hand, with a forlorn hope of claiming the cost of the call back on expenses; if Rome sold the Michaelangelos and a couple of the Raphaels, it'd sure make a hole in it ...) did the same, and then sat for thirty seconds or so as still as a gatepost.\n\nHe'd just been listening to _Hell ..._\n\nAnd they sounded just like _us_ ...\n\nGeorge, meanwhile, was making a frantic search of his mental card-index to find some way of breaking the news. 'Boys,' he said, 'it's like this.'\n\n'Yeah?' Prodsnap replied eagerly. 'When do we go home?'\n\n'Er.Soon.'\n\n'Great. How soon?'\n\n'Just as soon...' No tactful way to say this. 'As soon as we've killed that goddamn dragon.'\n\nLet's just pause a while to nail a false, misleading anti-feminist maxim. It's not true that Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Scorned women are Mother Theresa on her birthday compared to demons duped. Or thinking they've been duped.\n\n'Told you!' Slitgrind crowed triumphantly. 'Told you no evil'd come of co-operating with the enemy. Crafty little angel got us to do his dirty work for him and then goes and welches on us. Typical!'\n\n'Now hang on a minute,' Chardonay started to say, leaning forward and giving George a stern look; but he never got the chance to finish his sentence, because a split second later, Snorkfrod whizzed past him, making a direct course for George's throat. Fortunately for George, she slipped on an empty Guinness bottle and ended up sitting in the coal scuttle, making the most ferocious noises. For his part, George took advantage of the brief lull to get a good, solid utility Chesterfield between himself and the scions of Hell.\n\n'All right,' he said, as soothingly as he could. 'Just calm down a second while I explain.'\n\nSnorkfrod, having extracted herself from the scuttle, tensed for another spring, but Chardonay's gesture restrained her. She remained crouched and ready to go, growling ominously.\n\n'We'd better hear what he's got to say,' Chardonay advised. 'There may be a perfectly reasonable explanation.'\n\nGeorge nodded like a frightened metronome. 'There is,' he said. 'Look, we blew the statue up, but obviously we didn't kill the dragon. God only knows how, but the little toe-rag somehow managed to clear off at the last minute.'\n\n'So?'\n\n'So,' George replied, 'the original plan holds good. Kill the dragon and there's your passport home. It's just that it's not going to be quite so pathetically simple as we originally thought it would be.'\n\nThere were snarls and grumbles as the logic soaked in, creosote-fashion. Chardonay rubbed his chin.\n\n'All right,' he said. 'But how do we find him? That's going to be the problem, isn't it?'\n\nGeorge allowed himself the luxury of a fresh lungful of air. 'Shouldn't be too hard,' he said airily. 'I mean, the sucker's an enormous green flying lizard. You can't keep something like that secret for very long. And besides,' he continued, 'we have something he's bound to come back for. You know, irresistible bait.'\n\n'Yeah? What?'\n\nGeorge beamed. 'Us.'\n\nSo they waited.\n\nTrue, the last thing they wanted to do was make themselves harder than necessary to find; on the other hand, they had to be practical. The last thing any of them wanted was a nasty theological incident, such as might be caused by the discovery that a saint and five devils were wandering around loose in the twentieth century, where they had no business to be. A certain measure of discretion was called for if there wasn't going to be a massive row, severing of supernatural relations, tit-for-tat expulsions and a spate of films with names like _Demons VI_ and _Return of the Saint_.\n\nThere was also one further practicality to be borne in mind, one whose importance grew steadily as the days passed.\n\n'I can't stick this sodding place a second longer,' Slitgrind growled, putting the problem neatly into words. 'It's bad enough being cooped up here with that pillock Chardonay and that murderous tart of his without that frigging saint and his wet sock of a priest.'\n\n'I know,' Prodsnap replied quietly. In his case, he could hack Chardonay and Snorkfrod; with an effort and an advance on the next thousand years' self-control ration he could even put up with George and Father Kelly (who had taken to carrying a bell and a candle round with him and reading a book while he did the washing up). What he couldn't stand another day of was Slitgrind.\n\n'I quite like it here,' said Holdall. On the second day, he'd discovered televised snooker and was addicted. It wasn't that they didn't have it back home, it was just that it was reserved for a small group of very, very special customers.\n\n'Look,' Prodsnap said, 'basically it's very simple. We've got to get out of here before we all start climbing the walls. On the other hand, we can't go very far, or the bloody dragon won't know where to look for us.'\n\n'That's your idea of simple, is it?' Slitgrind jeered. 'What d'you do for an intellectual challenge, bend spoons?'\n\n'Basically,' Prodsnap repeated coldly, 'very simple. What we need,' he went on confidently, 'is a miracle.'\n\nFor the record, he'd got the technical term nearly but not quite right. What he meant was a Miracle Play, one of those rambling medieval verse dramas that have somehow eluded five hundred years of supposed good taste, and which get put on from time to time by over-enthusiastic amateurs, itinerant Volkswagen-camper-propelled bands of actors who aren't so much the fringe as the frayed hem, and the National Theatre. Stood up on a stage in a Scout hut or church hall somewhere, Saint George, five demons and a priest in a cotton-wool beard calling himself God wouldn't look too badly out of place; or at least no more than is usual under the circumstances.\n\n'The point being,' Prodsnap explained to his fellow sufferers, 'we can bumble round in a van or something and nobody's going to take a blind bit of notice. But if Chummy really is out there looking for us, then a load of posters with SAINT GEORGE AND THE DRAGON all over them ought at least to catch the bugger's attention.'\n\nIt went to the vote - five in favour, two (guess which) against. Carried. That, Chardonay explained naively, was democracy in action. He was puzzled slightly by the response he got to that, each side claiming that they knew all about democracy, and that it was a dirty trick developed by the Opposition which they had taken over and skilfully converted to peaceful, beneficial uses. In any event, the ultimate consensus ran, we've made a decision now; let's do something. That, however, is as far as the consensus went.\n\nProximity, however, is as great a negotiator as time is a healer. Forty-eight hours of each others' company in a relatively small house managed to achieve what a thousand diplomats, with translators, fax machines and a warehouseful of heat'n'serve Embassy function canapes would have taken six months to obfuscate. Father Kelly got a book of miracle plays out of the library and spent a busy afternoon in the Diocesan office playing with the photocopier while the girls' backs were turned. George hotwired an old Bedford van.\n\nThe show hit the road.\n\n'Who are you?' David repeated.\n\nBeing number one on the Italian police's Most Wanted list isn't as much hassle as it sounds if they're looking for a twelve-foot-high nude statue, and you're actually six foot one and wearing jeans, a standard tourist issue aertex shirt and trainers. To be on the safe side, however, David was also wearing sunglasses, and it had cost his companion dearly in both time and eloquence to dissuade him from buying a false beard.\n\n'Me? Oh, that's not important.'\n\nContext, not to mention the manner in which the words were spoken, belied this remark to such an extent that David risked raising his voice - he'd been talking in what he fondly believed was a conspiratorial whisper ever since they'd broken out of the museum, and kindly old ladies kept offering him cough sweets - as he insisted on a straight answer. His companion shrugged.\n\n'My name's Kurt,' he said. 'I used to be a soldier of fortune. What's that word you guys got? _Condottiere._ That was me.'\n\n'Used to be? Was?'\n\n'Yeah.' Kurt nodded. 'I'm dead. Or I was. Jeez, this is confusing. Okay, I used to be alive, then I was dead for a while, only not properly dead. There were reasons at the time.'\n\nDavid wrinkled his classically perfect brow. 'You didn't die thoroughly enough?' he hazarded. 'Skimped on the actual expiry?'\n\n'Something like that. A steam engine dropped on me. But that,' he added, fending off any request for amplification with an eloquent waft of a finger, 'doesn't really matter. Before I died, or did whatever I did, I used to be a bounty hunter. And a mercenary,' he added with pride, 'and a contract killer, and all that sort of stuff. Man, I was the best.' He frowned. 'Maybe I still am, I dunno. I mean, am I still me, bearing in mind that this ain't actually _my_ body? In fact, I don't have a clue whose body this is.' He cranked the frown over into a scowl and finished his coffee. 'The hell with it, anyway. The relevant parts are, I used to be a _condottiere,_ then I was dead, then I think I was some kinda statue for a short while, and now I'm—' He glanced down at his arms, his expression implying that they weren't quite a good fit '—whoever the hell this is.' He glowered accusingly at David. 'Man, this is your fault, you started this crazy subject.'\n\n'Sorry.'\n\nKurt waved his apology aside. 'No worries,' he said, and considered for a moment. 'I think what happened to me was—'\n\nIn actual fact, Kurt's version was so completely wide of the mark as to be at right angles to it, and will therefore be suppressed in the interests of clarity. The truth is that, during his lifetime, an acute merchandising concern cashed in on his extreme notoriety by marketing the Kurt Lundqvist All Action Doll - $15.99 for the basic doll, uniforms and accessories extra, for complete list write Jotapian Industries, PO Box 666, Kansas City. Some time after his death, an unknown hand had smuggled one of these loathsome plastic objects into the Florence Academy and left it in a dark corner, ignoring the risk that a speck of stray dust from far-distant Birmingham might float in through an open window one sunny day and land on it.\n\n'I see,' David lied. 'How fascinating. So,' he went on, sipping his glass of water. 'What happens now?'\n\nKurt shrugged. 'I got a job to do,' he replied. 'You can tag along, I guess, or you can split. Up to you.'\n\n'Split?' David looked down to check he was still in one piece. 'You mean these body things-tear easily, or something? That's another thing. How did we stop being statues and start being, um, people?'\n\n'Search me.' Kurt shook his head. 'It just kinda happens, I guess. You can either stay in your statue, or you can bug out and wander around in the skin suit. Who cares how it works so long as it works?'\n\nThat, David conceded, wasn't something you could reasonably argue with. As far as he was concerned, he was living on borrowed time, although who he was borrowing it from, and whether they'd eventually want it back, was far from clear.\n\n'This job,' he said tentatively.\n\n'Big job,' replied Kurt with an expansive gesture, which a passing waiter took to be a request for the bill. 'So important, I guess, they had to bring me back from the dead to do it.' He grinned. 'Hey,' he said, 'that kinda suggests I still am the best, doesn't it? That's good to know.'\n\n'The job.'\n\n'What? Oh, yeah. The job is, to bring out the hostages.'\n\nDavid raised an eyebrow. 'Hostages?'\n\n'Okay, so they aren't actually hostages. More like key figures. And figurines, too. The idea is, there's a lot of important statues gonna get...' Kurt hesitated, searching for the right word. 'Woken up, I guess. Liberated. Occupied. Possessed. Anyway, my part is, as soon as they wake up I gotta get 'em out of wherever they're at and turn 'em loose. Tough assignment, yes?'\n\n'Very.' David nodded emphatically. 'Have you any idea why?'\n\n'Me? No way. The first thing you learn in this business is not to ask questions. Well, you gotta ask some questions, like _Which guy's the one needs wasting? and Where's the goddamn safety catch on this thing_? But apart from that, no questions. Especially no questions beginning with _Why?'_\n\n'Um.' David looked at him through a purported smile. The man's stark staring mad, he told himself. 'Well, thanks for the job offer, I'll give it some really serious thought. In the meantime, any idea what I'm supposed to do next?'\n\nKurt shrugged. 'Not in my brief, pal. Maybe you got a destiny to manifest, in which case go for it, do well. Or maybe you should just get a job in a sandwich bar somewhere and live semi-happily ever after, like regular people do. None of my goddamn business, either way.'\n\n'Quite.'\n\n'The other part of the job is,' Kurt went on, 'I gotta kill a dragon.'\n\nThere are quite a few differences between statues and people. Bianca was learning about them.\n\nA few examples. Statues are beautiful. When a statue gets broken, you can glue back the bits with epoxy resin, rather than hang about waiting for bones to knit. Likewise, if you attempted to sign your name on the plaster cast of the _Winged Victory,_ the next thing you'd see would be the pavement rushing up to meet you.\n\nThe key difference, however, and the one which made Bianca realise just how lucky statues are, wasn't something that had immediately sprung to mind. She had learned it by long, bitter experience.\n\nTo wit: true, both statues and humans in hospital get people coming to see them. Statues, however, don't get talked to.\n\n'No, Auntie,' Bianca said, for the nineteenth time. 'Thank you,' she added, quickly but not quickly enough. When Aunt Jane went visiting, umbrage futures soared. By now, Bianca reckoned, Aunt Jane must have enough umbrage to start her own international bourse.\n\n'Suit yourself, dear,' Aunt Jane replied, in a voice Bianca would have found useful for putting an edge on blunt chisels. 'Only trying to help. I'll leave them here anyway.' Sigh. 'You don't have to read them if you don't want to.'\n\nExhibit One; a stack of women's magazines, late 1980s vintage. Recipes. Knitting patterns. Advice to the frustrated and the suicidal. Two of the three were unlikely to be much use to a girl in traction, but she was getting to the stage where she was quite interested in the third.\n\n'It's very thoughtful of you,' Bianca said. Who was the kid whose nose grew when he told lies? Much more of this and she'd make Cyrano look like an Eskimo. 'I really appreciate it. You're very kind.'\n\nAunt Jane's lips twitched in a tiny sneerlet. Gratitude fell into her without any perceptible effect, like matter into a black hole. 'Well,' she said, 'I suppose I'd better be going, your uncle'll be wanting his tea. I'll _try_ to come in tomorrow, though it'll mean missing Weightwatchers. I'll see if I can find you some more things to read.'\n\nAs Aunt Jane waddled doorwards, Bianca resisted the urge to wish her a nasty accident. She meant well. More to the point, if she had a nasty accident, she'd probably end up in the next bed.\n\nThe sad part about it was, Bianca knew, that in an hour or so, try as she might, she'd pick up one of those damned magazines and start to read. She'd already read all her own books - ever since school she'd been one of those people who zooms through printed pages like motorbikes through traffic - and there was nothing, absolutely nothing, else to do. If the loathsome things weren't there, of course, she couldn't read them. But since they were, she could. And, ineluctably as Death, she would.\n\nThis time, she lasted forty-seven minutes and was just congratulating herself on consummate willpower when she realised that her usable hand had slithered treacherously and nipped a glossy from the pile. Ah well, she assured her soul, I tried. She brought the thing up on top of the sheet and opened it.\n\nThinking it through afterwards, she worked out how it must have happened. Aunt Jane obtained her supplies of obsolescent opium-of-the-female-masses from the waiting room of the doctors' surgery where she worked as receptionist (exceptionally effective in reducing waiting times; you had to be practically dying to want to make an appointment). From time to time, waiting rooms and other similarly depressing public places get leafletted by the keen and eager - bring and buys, craft fairs, save our derelict and unwanted civic amenities and, of course, the amateur dramatics fiends. Easy enough to scoop up a few stray fliers along with the pulp.\n\nThe playbill in front of her read as follows:\n\n **FOR THREE NIGHTS ONLY!  \n_H & H Thespians present -  \n_ SAINT GEORGE AND THE DRAGON  \n_ORIGINAL CAST_!  \nJULY 17, 18, 19**\n\nSadley Grange Civic Centre  \nTickets £2 at the door.\n\nReaction one: now there's a coincidence.\n\nReaction two: coincidence my foot ...\n\nReaction three: ... which is in plaster. Damn!\n\n_Original cast_? Surely not. One key player, she knew, was unavailable due to indisposition caused by having been blasted to smithereens.\n\nUnless ...\n\n_Hey_! Calm down, Bianca, think it through. Just suppose for one moment that blowing up the statue hadn't actually killed the dragon. Now, then; whoever wanted him dead - answers on a postcard, please - presumably would want to try again. First, however, catch your dragon. With his marble overcoat reduced to fine dust, the dragon would be walking the streets in human mufti, impossible to recognise. Hence the need for bait and heavy duty, industrial grade hints.\n\nBianca sneezed; dust from the pile of magazines. Why do I get the feeling, she asked herself, that I'm witnessing the early stages of a major war?\n\nThe irony of her situation made her wince, as if someone had just put a goldfish down her neck. All around her, the forces of weirdness were tooling up for a major confrontation. Somehow, she knew, she might be able to prevent it. Except that she was stuck here, as immobilised in her plasterwork as the dragon and the rogue saint had been in the stone bodies she'd made for them. Quite what the significance of that was, she didn't pretend to understand. But she knew significance when she saw it; she knew it even better when it was forced down her throat with a hydraulic ram.\n\n'Great,' she muttered aloud. 'Just when I'm needed, I have to go and get plastered.'\n\n'Sorry?' She looked up, but it was only Mike, squeezing in for the last five minutes of visiting time with his no longer quite so funny comedy props; grapes, lemon barley water, more bloody magazines.\n\n'Just muttering,' she said. 'Mike, find out how much longer I'm going to be stuck inside all this masonry There's all sorts of things I ought to be doing.'\n\nMike shrugged. 'Anything I can help with?' he asked.\n\n'N—'\n\nOn the one hand, if Mankind was a stockroom, you'd find Mike on the shelf marked _Amiable Idiots._ On the other hand ...\n\n'Yes,' she said.\n**CHAPTER TEN**\n\n**'C** lever,' muttered the dragon, with obvious distaste.\n\nThe storage unit, or dungeon, in which his statue was kept had obviously cost someone a lot of money. You reached it by walking down a long, dragon-sized tunnel, a bit like a torpedo tube, which led from an iron porthole in the side of a very tall cliff something like a quarter of a mile through solid rock to a big chamber. The chamber door was marble, two feet thick, mounted on chrome molybdenum steel hinges and opening inwards.\n\n'Who knows?' Chubby said, indicating all that workmanship and expense with a dismissive wave. 'For all I know, you could smash and burn your way out through that, eventually. But by the time you'd got halfway, we'd have flooded the chamber with gas and you'd be off to Bedfordshire up the little wooden hill.'\n\nThe dragon shrugged. 'Pity,' he said.\n\n'Yes,' Chubby agreed, 'it is. It's like ...' He closed his eyes to help his concentration. 'Although your mum and dad don't mind you borrowing the car, it's irksome having to ask permission and say where you're going every time you fancy a spin. Please note,' he added, 'the little metal box round its, I mean your, neck.'\n\n'I was going to ask.'\n\n'A bomb,' Chubby sighed. 'I know, I feel awful, but what can I do? We're businessmen, not conservationists. Look, there's no nice way to say this. If you muck us about, anywhere in the inner solar system, inside the dragon cozzy or out of it, then a button gets pressed and goodbye dragons for ever. Clear?'\n\n'As crystal,' the dragon grunted.\n\n'No hard feelings?'\n\n'Get real.'\n\nChubby's round face showed a smile with turned down ends. 'Fair enough,' he said. 'If I was in your position, I'd sulk like hell. Actually, what I'd probably do is scrag me in the erroneous belief that I've got the button about my person. Just as well for you you're not me, really. From both sides, as it were.'\n\nThe dragon did some mental geometry. 'Quite,' he said. 'And on general principles, too. What about some lunch?'\n\nOver the Scottish salmon and aviation fuel, Chubby delicately raised the issue of timescale.\n\n'Not that we want to hurry you or anything,' he added quickly. 'Pleasure having you about the place and all that. It's just that time, if you'll excuse the context, is getting on, I can't earn a bent cent while those goat-hooved buffoons are in this dimension - I know because I've tried, God knows - and your old school chum's starting to get on my wick. Every time I go in my office, his blasted screen winks at me.'\n\nThe dragon laughed. 'He used to do that when he was a kid,' he replied. 'Just when you'd got up to answer the teacher's question, he'd wink at you or pull a face. Made you forget what you were going to say. He only does it for wickedness.'\n\n'I'll bet,' Chubby replied morosely. 'Look, I don't like to ask this, but who the fuck is he? I just know him as the genie of the PCW'\n\nThe dragon grinned and helped himself to a tumblerful of liquid propane. 'Guess,' he said.\n\n'Oh come on,' Chubby replied.\n\n'No, three guesses. Odd how guesses come in threes, by the way. Like wishes. And, as far as I can judge from a very limited observation of your culture, petrol-driven public transport vehicles.'\n\n'All right. He's a djinn.'\n\n'Close but no cigar.'\n\n'Evil spirit?'\n\n'Yes, but that's not a proper guess because so am I. And so,' he said, wrinkling his nose and emptying his glass into a flower pot, 'is this. Haven't you got any of that decent stuff we had the other night?'\n\n'You drank it all. Try some of this liquid nitrogen. An insouciant little concoction, but I think you may be frozen stiff by its presumption.'\n\n'Better,' agreed the dragon. 'Two more guesses.'\n\n'Okay. How about a god?'\n\nThe dragon shook his head. 'There is no god but God,' he replied. 'Nice phrase, that. Read it on the back of a cornflakes packet.'\n\n'All right. A devil.'\n\n'Wrong third time.' The dragon swilled the dregs of his glass round to make the vapour rise. 'He's a dragon.'\n\nChubby's eyebrows rose, like the price of gold in an oil crisis. 'Straight up? I thought you were the only one?'\n\n'Far from it.' The dragon frowned. 'Lord only knows what he's done with his body, but my old mate Nosher is, or was, a dragon, same as me. Little, weedy chap he used to be, we called him Nosher the Newt. If he ever reached fifteen feet nose to tail, I'd be surprised.'\n\nChubby let that pass. 'So what's he doing in my computer?' he asked. 'Or didn't you get around to catching up on life stories?'\n\n'No idea. I did ask him, but he didn't actually seem to answer. He was always good at that, too, specially when you were asking him to pay back a loan or something. Bright lad, Nosher, but you wouldn't trust him as far as you could sneeze him. Something tells me that hasn't changed terribly much.'\n\n'We're drifting,' Chubby pointed out, 'away from the subject under review. Namely, when can you start?'\n\n'Not bothered,' the dragon replied. 'It's more a case of where rather than when, isn't it? It's all very well to talk blithely about carbonising these goons, but I don't actually know where to find them. I'd have thought you, with all those resources and instruments and things ...'\n\nChubby looked embarrassed. 'I was afraid you'd say that,' he replied through a mouthful of Stilton. 'And it's bloody curious, I don't mind admitting. Look, every time I've tried taking the crones out to do a spot of rustling, it's been a complete washout because of diabolical interference. Static so thick you could spread it on bread. But can I pinpoint the wretched critters? Can I buggery. It's almost as if the negative vibes are being masked by something else.'\n\n'What, you mean like virtue?'\n\nChubby shook his head. 'Not virtue, chum. That'd counteract it and there'd be no interference. No, it's like a very strong signal on an adjacent wavelength that sort ofblurs out the devils so you can't actually hear them.' He wanted to light a cigar, but thought better of it. 'Which implies it's a very similar sort of signal, though different enough not to jam up my old biddies. It's a bugger, it really is.'\n\nThe nitrogen cylinder fizzed again, until the dragon's glass was replenished. 'Not really,' he said. 'That sounds to me like that bastard George. He's a saint, remember, so he's probably got vibes of his own. And he's an evil little sod but officially Good, which'd account for similar but not identical signals.' He scowled at the thought of George, and the glass shattered in his hand. He didn't notice. 'Sounds to me like George and those demons of yours are still mobbed up together, presumably so that they can have another crack at me. I've got no idea, by the way, why a bunch of devils should wish me any harm. As far as I know I've never done anything to offend their outfit. In fact, since I'm officially Evil they should be on my side.'\n\nChubby wisely said nothing. A certain overtone crept into the dragon's voice when he spoke of George; the sort of nuance you'd observe in a conversation between authors about book reviewers. All to the good, as far as Chubby was concerned.\n\n'Funny bloke, by all accounts,' the dragon went on. 'Oddly enough, I knew a man who was at school with him, that training college for saints they used to have out Glastonbury way.'\n\nChubby, who'd been doing his background reading, nodded. 'You mean the old Alma Martyr?'\n\n'Right little tearaway he was, by all accounts. Bottom of the class in everything, failed all his Inquisitions, always in detention, doing lines. Never even turned up to heresy-detection classes. Nearly got expelled for refusing to shoot arrows at Saint Sebastian.'\n\n'Fancy,' Chubby said.\n\n'Always up to that sort of thing. You know, untying Catherine from her wheel, stuffing the lions in the Amphitheatre full of Whiskas so they wouldn't eat the Christians. Must've been a right pain in the neck.'\n\n'Absolutely,' Chubby agreed. But he was secretly thinking: Hey, what's so terrible about trying to stop people from getting shot, burnt and eaten? Well, different strokes and all that.\n\n'Be that as it may.' The dragon stood up, untucked his napkin from his collar and finished the last of the nitrogen. 'Soon as you get a fix on these jokers, let me know and they're firelighters. See you at dinner.'\n\nChubby stayed where he was, waited for the extractor fans to clear the nitrogen fumes and lit his cigar.\n\nSo the genie of the PCW was a dragon. Well, that explained absolutely nothing at all. As a clue, it made _The Times_ crossword seem like an exploded diagram. But that, surely, was because he was being too thick to see the point. If there was a point.\n\nProbably all a coincidence.\n\nAbsolutely. All a coincidence. Like the remarkable coincidence whereby whenever someone falls off the top of the Sears Tower they die shortly afterwards. You can get paranoid, thinking too hard about coincidences.\n\nMike looked at the address written on the back of his chequebook and then at the building in front of him.\n\nWell, yes. It was the sort of place, by the looks of it, where you had to abandon all hope before entering. But a resort of demons? Surely not. If demons lived here, then Hell was a neat row of 1960s spec-built terraces, with open-plan front gardens and a Metro outside each one.\n\nGood point. Yes. Muttering all he could remember of the Hail Mary (which was, as it happens, Hail Mary), he pushed the front door and went in.\n\n'Eeek!' he said.\n\nThe woman at the ticket desk gave him an impatient, Not-you-as-well look, held up a slip of paper with a seat number on it, and said, 'Two pounds, please.' She was holding the piece of paper in what could only be described as a talon.\n\n'Er, you in the show?' he asked.\n\n'That's right,' she replied. 'Costume startle you, did it?'\n\nMike nodded. 'It's very, um, realistic.'\n\n'How would you know?'\n\n'All-right, I don't. Can I go in now, please?'\n\nHe found his seat (one of those bendy bucket-shaped plastic chairs which you're convinced is going to break when you sit on it, though it never does) and took a long look at the stage. There was no curtain. The usual amateur dramatics set, all black-painted hardboard, silver paper and things borrowed from people's homes. Mundane. Prosaic. Everyday. Like, in fact, the woman at the door had been, except that she was obviously a ...\n\nAnother look round, this time at the audience. There were fifteen or so people scattered about the hall, eating boiled sweets and reading the photocopied programme. Either they hadn't noticed that they'd just been sold their tickets by a ... or else they didn't care. Possible, Mike told himself; very tolerant people, Midlanders. But - _my God, those fangs_! - improbable.\n\nHe looked at the programme. Cast list, as follows:\n\nGEORGE ( _a saint)_ ..... Himself\n\nCHARDONAY ( _a demon)_ ..... Himself\n\nSLITGRIND ( _a demon)_ ..... Himself\n\nPRODSNAP ( _a demon)_ ..... Himself\n\nHOLDALL ( _a demon)_ ..... Himself\n\nSNORKFROD ( _a demon)_ ..... Herself\n\nTHE DRAGON ..... Members of the cast\n\nAh well, Mike said to himself, leaning back as far as he dared and opening his bag of Maltesers, I expect I've been to worse. Most of them, he remembered, at the Barbican.\n\nThe lights went down. The chattering almost stopped.\n\nPlay time.\n\n'Found them!' Chubby yelled.\n\nThe dragon looked up from the encyclopedia he'd been reading and grinned. 'Splendid. Where?'\n\n'Wherever the hell this is.' Chubby handed him a creased playbill and a map. 'Ready to go?'\n\nThe dragon grinned.\n\nAnybody ever wondered, Mike asked himself a quarter of the way through the first half, why so much of medieval literature is anonymous? Answer, easy. Who'd want to own up to having written this?\n\nAt least there hadn't been Morris dancing. Not yet. That, he admitted to himself, was like saying that nuclear bombs are safe because the world's still in one piece. That aside, it had set his mind at rest on one score. No question but that these people were in the everlasting torment business; the cream, in fact, of their profession. Solemnly and with the utmost sincerity, Mike resolved that from now on he was going to be very, very good, for ever and ever.\n\nSo deep was he in silent repentance that he didn't notice that someone was now sitting in the seat next to him, until that person leaned across and whispered a request to look at his programme.\n\n'Sure,' Mike whispered back. He passed over the sheet. As he did so, he became aware of an oppressive heat and a smell like petrol. He glanced out of the corner of his eye.\n\nPerfectly ordinary bloke. All his imagination. Except—\n\nThe bloke had yellow eyes. Round, golden eyeballs, with a narrow black slit for a pupil. And no eyelids.\n\nMidlanders (see above) are tolerant folk, and Mike was from Brierley Hill where they don't care who you are or what you do so long as you leave the buildings still standing afterwards. Devils; no problem, after all, we're all God's creatures. But, as soon as he'd recovered the use of his momentarily paralysed limbs, he was out of his seat, through the door and running like a hare. Sensible chap.\n\nBecause, while he was still running, there was a horrible dull _bang_! followed by a whooshing noise, broken glass music and the very distinctive sound of fire. Instinct sent Mike sprawling on the ground, his head shielded by his elbows, as the first few bits of masonry and timber started to hit the ground all around him. And oh Christ, the smell ...\n\nLate change to the cast as advertised. Whoever was playing the dragon tonight had just brought the house down.\n\nThe dragon opened his eyes.\n\nThere was, he observed, a large steel girder lying across his back. He shook himself like a wet dog, sending it spinning off into the rubble.\n\nHe appeared to have made rather a mess.\n\nThe drip-drip-dripping noise was still-molten steel; wire reinforcements in the concrete. The groaning sound was material contracting as it cooked, rather than an indication that there was still anything else even temporarily alive in the ruined building. No chance of that, whatsoever.\n\nIn the distance, the mechanical wailing noise the dragon had come to associate with impending public attention. He spread his wings, flapped them and rose in a cloud of dust and sparks. Job done, time to go home. Five wingbeats lifted him into the upper air; five more and he was cruising through the sound barrier, heading west.\n\nAs he flew, he couldn't help reflecting that, in exacting his entirely justifiable revenge on George, he'd also killed five demons - well, so what? The worst that can happen to anything mortal is that it dies and goes to Hell; he'd saved them a bus fare - and fifteen or so innocent human beings who happened to be there. Hmm.\n\nNo, the hell with that, it was a matter of omelettes and eggs. They belonged to a different species altogether and were none of his concern. To feed those fifteen, and all the others like them in this city alone, a million chickens a day ride to their deaths on a conveyer belt. And, emotive reactions aside, there was nothing wrong with that either because of a hard but fair rule of Nature called Survival of the Fittest. It was a rule he'd never really had a problem with, even when he'd been hiding in the rocks watching all the rest of his kind being exterminated by these people's great-to-the-power-of-twenty-grandfathers. Plenty more where those came from; and who's the endangered species around here, anyway?\n\nAs he flew, feeling the almost infinite power of his body, acknowledging the potential of his lazy but undoubtedly superior intellect, he sensed that maybe the jury was still out on that one.\n\nThey brought the woman down from intensive care at about half past three that morning and put her in the bed next to Bianca. Superficial burns, light concussion, shock. She'd live. She'd been lucky, the ward sister explained. She'd only been passing outside the Sadley Grange Civic Centre when it blew up. Those poor souls inside never stood a chance.\n\nWhat caused it? Nobody knew, as yet. They'd said on the news that the whole building suddenly burst into flames; not like an ordinary fire, which starts somewhere and gets steadily hotter, more like a firebomb attack, except who'd want to firebomb amateur dramatics?\n\n'Nurse,' Bianca said, 'I think I'm going to be—'\n\nAnd she was right.\n\n'They're saying it was the Libyans,' Chubby reported, topping up the dragon's cup with lighter fuel, 'God only knows why. I s'pose they've got to blame somebody, or what are foreigners for?'\n\n'Don't go on about it,' the dragon said. The bread was stale. He breathed gently on it and had toast, instead.\n\n'Don't see why not,' Chubby replied. 'You did good. Neat job, in and out, nobody saw you; or if they did, they've got too much common sense to stand in front of a microphone and say they've been seeing dragons. You could make a good living if you ... Sorry, I'll shut up. Pass the marmalade, there's a good fellow.'\n\n'Were there any survivors?'\n\nChubby laughed. 'Sure,' he said. 'Just not within a two-hundred-yard radius. Actually, there's an interesting side-light to the story, because that whole area's up for redevelopment, except that there was that tatty old hall bang in the middle of it and absolutely no way of getting rid of it. Now, of course, bulldozers may safely graze. In fact, we could get seriously rich if ever you felt—'\n\n'Chubby,' said the dragon quietly, 'I'd change the subject if I were you.'\n\n'Huh? Suit yourself.' Chubby spread marmalade, drank coffee. 'Sorry to harp on,' he said, 'but what exactly is bothering you? I thought you hated humans.'\n\n'Me?' the dragon looked at him. 'Whatever gave you that idea? As of nine twenty-seven pm yesterday, there's nobody and nothing left alive in this world that I hate, or even strongly dislike, although,' he added, with a slight twitch of his nostrils, 'this may change if a certain topic of conversation doesn't get shelved pretty damn quick.'\n\n'Sorry,' Chubby replied meekly. 'It's just that, since it was us who killed all your people, stole your birthright—'\n\n'Not you,' the dragon said. Inside his skull he could hear the faint chip-chip of a headache hatching from the egg. 'When the last of the people who wiped out the dragons died, there were still wolves wandering around the forests of Islington. And besides,' he added irritably, 'the thing with George and me had nothing to do with the dragon clearances. It was purely personal.'\n\n'Because of the Big Fight, huh? Because he won, simple as that?'\n\nThe dragon shook his head. 'He was _supposed_ to win. It was killing me that I didn't hold with. And now that's all over and done with, so let's drop it. All right?'\n\n'Right.' Chubby folded his newspaper, drained his coffee cup and stood up. 'So, as soon as you've done that little job—'\n\n'Who says I'm going to do the little job?' the dragon interrupted dangerously. 'Fuck you and your nasty bloody schemes. If you want to beat up on your own species, be my guest, it's none of my business. But I'm off.'\n\nChubby shook his head. He didn't say anything, but he patted the underside of his chin with the tips of his fingers. The bomb.\n\n'You bastard,' the dragon said softly. 'I ought to torch you right now.'\n\n'Inadvisable,' Chubby replied. 'With all that inflammable liquor inside you, they'd be picking up bits of you in Tokyo. And like I said, what's it to you? Different species, right?'\n\nThe dragon said nothing. Not that he needed words, exactly. He'd have been sent home from a Gorgons' children's party for pulling faces.\n\n'Welcome to the Baddies,' Chubby said, and left.\n\nThe fire brigade had gone home, the police were brewing up in their big blue-and-white portakabin and even the journalists had given up and gone to the pub. Under a pile of rubble, something stirred.\n\n'Have they gone?'\n\n'I think so.'\n\nThe pile of rubble avalanched, half-bricks and chunks of concrete scudding downslope, stirring up dust. A head and shoulders poked out. Eyes blinked in the starlight.\n\n'About bloody time, too. I've got a crick in my neck like a letter S.'\n\n'Keep your voice down, Slitgrind. And for pity's sake, stop complaining.'\n\nGradually, and with much seismic activity, the demons emerged, all five of them. They were dusty and, after twelve hours under the rubble, stiff as all Shopfloor. Apart from that, no ill effects whatsoever.\n\nA sixth pile shifted and turned into George. He wasn't in quite the same immaculate condition - he had a black eye, and his hair was all singed off - but otherwise he was intact. He dusted himself off, just like Oliver Hardy used to do in the films, and climbed out of the mess.\n\n'Now you see why we had to wear costumes,' he said.\n\nChardonay nodded. 'Good stuff,' he acknowledged. 'What did you call it?'\n\n'Asbestos,' George replied. 'And the lining's Kevlar, which is like old-fashioned steel armour, only lighter and a hell of a lot stronger. I used the same stuff for the scenery, too. Just as well,' he admitted. 'If we hadn't all ducked behind the flats the moment he materialised, I don't reckon the cozzies'd have been enough. Anyway, time we weren't here. Come on, you lot. The Padre'll be worried sick about us.'\n\nNobody had disturbed the rickety old Bedford van and soon they were on their way. Chardonay, sitting in the front with George, raised the obvious topic.\n\n'Well,' George replied, 'he took the bait all right, you've got to admit that much. Maybe we should have spent a little more time thinking through how we were actually going to scrag the bugger, but we'll know better next time.'\n\n_'Next time_!'\n\nGeorge nodded. 'Of course next time,' he replied, faintly puzzled by the demon's tone. 'Okay, so the first two attempts, we bombed. I mean, we didn't do so good. Third time lucky, eh? Think of Robert Bruce,' he added, 'and the spider.'\n\n'No, thanks,' Chardonay replied, shuddering. 'I'm scared of spiders. And now,' he added, with as much unpleasant overtone as he could muster, 'I'm also scared of dragons.'\n\n'Funny you should say that,' George said, blithely overtaking on a blind corner, 'because spiders have always terrified the shit out of me. But eventually I found a way to cope.'\n\n'Really?'\n\nGeorge nodded. 'I squash 'em,' he said. 'Helps put things in perspective when your mortal foe's looking like a raisin with hairs sticking in it. I think the same may hold true of dragons. Only one way to find out.'\n\nChardonay was about to say something, but wisely saved his breath. The way George was driving, he'd need it soon for horrified screaming.\n\n'Mind you,' George went on - he was definitely getting the hang of driving, because this time he remembered to brake with a full thousandth of a second to spare. 'It's going to be harder decoying the creep a second time because he's going to assume we're dead. And we can't exactly publicise the fact we aren't, because of the low profile thing. Tricky one, that.'\n\n'Aaaaagh!'\n\n'What? _Watch where you're going, you senile old fool_! Sorry, you were saying?'\n\nChardonay opened his eyes. 'I think,' he murmured, 'in this country they drive on the left.'\n\n'Ah. That'd explain a lot. Well spotted. To be honest with you, I think from now on it's going to be up to us to look for him, rather than the other way around. Don't you? Of course, we could try this gig again, only next time we'd be a bit better prepared, maybe plant a bomb of our own in the auditorium so as to be sure of getting him first. What d'you reckon?'\n\nA look of horrified disgust pitched camp on Chardonay's face. 'You couldn't do that,' he gasped. 'The audience. Innocent people.'\n\nGeorge shrugged. 'Not people, Char,' he said mildly. 'Potential customers, your lot's and mine. One stone, very many birds, huh?'\n\nIt's hard to stand on your dignity when you're horrified, petrified and covered from head to foot with brick dust. In Chardonay's case, he'd never had all that much dignity to start with; if he'd ever wanted to stand on it, he'd have had to master the knack of balancing on one foot. What little he had, however, he now used to good effect.\n\n'George,' he said, 'when you die, be sure to go to Heaven. We can do without your sort where I come from.'\n\nIn order to sell newspapers, you have to get your priorities right, and an unexplained explosion with fatalities is clearly rather more important than a spate of thefts from art galleries. The lead stories in the next day's papers were, therefore, in order of headline size and column inches:\n\n**ROYAL VET'S SEX ROMP WITH CHAUFFEUR**  \nSOUTHENDERS STAR IN LOVE TRIANGLE WITH PLUMBER  \nBUZZA DECKS REF IN OFFSIDE RUMPUS  \nBomb Kills Sixteen  \n_Statues Stolen From Italian Museum_\n\nThe statues - eight Berninis, three Donatellos, three Cellinis, a Canova and the Giambologna _Mercury_ \\- all went missing from various locations in the space of about eight hours. No sign of forced entry, no arrests, no clues. No visible connection, either.\n\n'Okay, guys. Guys!' Kurt banged on the floor with the butt of his rifle, but nobody took any notice. They were all talking at once, at the tops of their voices, in Italian. With a weary gesture of resignation, Kurt sat down on a packing-chest and waited.\n\n'Finished?' he demanded, ten minutes later. 'Good. Now, listen up.'\n\nSixteen pairs of malevolent eyes fixed on him. I don't need this, he reflected. I've got a nice cosy grave I could be in right now.\n\n'Now then,' he said. 'I guess you're all wondering why—'\n\nMarvellous language, Italian, for talking very fast in. They should insist all peace conferences should be in Italian; that way, nobody'd ever know what was going on long enough to start the war. 'Shuttup!' he cried. Not a blind bit of notice.\n\nScuse me.'\n\nHe turned. 'Well?'\n\n'Looks to me,' David said, 'like they're upset about something.'\n\nKurt scowled. 'What the fuck've they got to be upset about, for Chrissakes? I've just sprung the suckers, they should be goddamn _grateful.'_\n\nDavid made a small head gesture indicative of doubt. 'Look at it this way,' he said. 'They're all male figures, all of Italian origin. Maybe standing about all day being admired is what they like doing best.'\n\nThe proposition had merit, Kurt admitted, but that wasn't his affair. He was only, as the expression goes, obeying orders. _'HEY_! _'_ he said.\n\n'Thank you,' he went on. 'All I can tell you is, my instructions said to get you out of those museums and galleries and bring you here. Which I've done. From now on, guys, you're on your...'\n\nHe stopped, puzzled. Instead of jabbering at him, shaking fists and waving arms, they were standing about like a lot of shop-window dummies.\n\nMaybe that was it; knock off priceless works of art and punt them out at twelve dollars a head to the leading New York department stores. Or maybe not.\n\n'Guys?'\n\nLong silence. Then a statue put its hand up.\n\n'Excuse me,' it said. And, Kurt noticed, in English.\n\n'Shoot,' he said.\n\n'Excuse me,' said the statue - shit, it was a _female_ voice now - 'but can you tell us what's going on, please?'\n\nKurt swallowed. Spooky no longer worried him. He felt comfortable around spooky. Weird was as familiar to him as a pair of well-worn slippers. But this was _strange._\n\n'Hey,' he said. 'I just did.'\n\n'Only,' the voice bleated on. 'I told my husband the play'd be over by ten and I'd be home in time to make him a late tea. And that was hours ago, and he gets all upset if his meals aren't when he expects them.'\n\nGradually, while Kurt was trying to get his larynx working again, the other fifteen joined in, a symphony of bleats and whines forming a baroque fugue around the same main theme.\n\n'I ...' Kurt had raised his hand for silence, and obtained it instantly. Thirty-two eyes were gazing at him. He could feel the blood rushing to his cheeks. It was _horrible._\n\n'I ...'\n\nThirty-two ears, hanging on his every word. Jesus, he told himself, now the suckers are all goddamn British.\n\nHe turned, grabbed David by the arm and dragged him forward. 'My assistant will explain,' he said, and ran for it.\n**CHAPTER ELEVEN**\n\n**'T** he job,' Chubby explained, 'is basically very simple.'\n\nIt was, the dragon wanted to point out, perishing cold. The air was full of high-velocity snow which he could feel even through his scales. There was nothing to be seen in any direction except flat white. Chubby and the dragon stood alone in an albino wilderness, like the last two balls on a white snooker table.\n\n'That's not to say,' Chubby went on, 'that it's easy. Easy and simple don't necessarily mean the same thing. What I want you to do is simple, as opposed to complicated, but very, very difficult. With me so far?'\n\nThe dragon couldn't speak because his teeth were chattering like a school party in a theatre, so he nodded instead.\n\n'All you have to do,' Chubby continued, 'is fly, any direction you like, as fast as you possibly can. Direction doesn't matter 'cos we're at the North Pole. Speed, however, is of the essence.'\n\nThe dragon frowned. 'Don't you mean time?' he queried. Chubby grinned.\n\n'That,' he said, 'is either a naive remark or a very poor joke. Now then, here's your parcel, don't drop it. When I want you to stop, this little buzzer thing on your collar will bleep. Wonder of micro-electronics, that, cost me a fortune.' He paused, recited a check-list under his breath, and took five steps back. 'When you're ready,' he said.\n\nThe dragon shrugged. 'Now?'\n\n'Now.'\n\nTheory: travel faster than light around the Earth and you can move forwards in Time.\n\nA likely story. Like all great hypotheses, the theory of relativity relies on the basic assumption that nobody will ever be able to do the experiment which will prove it wrong; and anything that can't be disproved must be true. Garnish with fresh mathematics, heat and serve.\n\nBut supposing it's true, and feasible. Think, not of the fame, the glory and the Nobel prize, but of the commercial possibilities.\n\nCorrect; there are none. That's why it's a safe hypothesis. Nobody will ever try the experiment because there's nothing in it for the institutional investors. That's why there's a whole lot of scientific theories about the nature of the space/time continuum, and rather fewer about the medium-term acceleration of racehorses. It'd be different, of course, if you could then send a messenger from the future back to the present, notebook crammed with stock exchange results, football scores, winning lottery numbers and the like; but that's impossible, according to the theory. Guess why.\n\nThe truth is that it's possible - simple, even (see above) to travel back through Time, in roughly the same way as you can travel forwards. It involves flying round the world, yes; but at a rather different tempo.\n\nTo go forwards, you have to fly faster than light. To go backwards, you have to fly slower than history. The maths goes like this:\n\nT-d=h\n\nP=n+h\n\n—where T is Time, d is disinformation, h is history, P stands for the Past, and n is the now, or present.\n\nFor anybody who missed the first sixteen lessons, here's a very simplistic summary.\n\nThe past is made up of the present plus an awareness of there having been a time before the present; the awareness is called history. The speed at which history travels is equal to the speed of Time, less the time it takes to record it. The recording of history is slowed down by disinformation; official secrets, the reluctance of participants to tell the story because of the repercussions on themselves, and so on. The quantum of d varies from nation to nation, culture to culture; in Britain, there's a thirty-year rule which means that nobody can look at important official documents for thirty years, whereas in the USA the freedom-of-information statutes say that you can see them straight away, except for the really important ones, which nobody ever gets to see at all. In some regimes, history gets rewritten every time there's a change of government personnel. The constant d is therefore not a constant at all; accordingly history moves at a different speed depending on where you are, and in some places it's at a complete standstill or moving backwards.\n\nFly round the world, therefore, and you're constantly crossing into different history zones. As you soar over the continents, the retrospective march of Time, from present to past, is taking place at all sorts of different speeds. Instead of being a tidal wave, crashing relentlessly down onto the reef of the present, the advance of history is a confused mess of recollection particles, swarming about in no sort of order. And there are always particles that move so slowly in comparison with the others that they're getting left further and further behind; relatively speaking, going the wrong way.\n\nReverse history and you reverse Time.\n\nIn practical terms, then; if as you fly round the world you follow a carefully plotted course through the anomalies of the different history zones, you can get so far behind that you'll be travelling backwards in time. As a further refinement, if you have moles and undercover agents at work in universities, public records offices and national computer archives all over the world, busily hiding, destroying, obscuring, obfuscating, rewriting, stuffing files down the backs of radiators and generally sabotaging the manufacture of history, you can _control_ the production of anomalies and artificially create a navigable course from a given point in the future back to a given point in the past. Or, as the classic equation so elegantly puts it:\n\nI = fd2\n\n\\- where I stands for the Time-traveller's itinerary, d is disinformation as above, and f stands for a statistically acceptable incidence of clerical and administrative fuckups.\n\nWhile we're on the subject of Time, it's universally acknowledged to be a great healer. By rights, therefore, it should be available free of charge through the National Health Service. But it isn't, of course. If you want chronotherapy, you have to go private.\n\n'It'll cost you, mind,' the doctor muttered in a low voice.\n\n'Very, very expensive. Not to mention illegal. If they catch me doing this, I'll be lucky if I can get a job casting out evil spirits in New Guinea.'\n\n'I don't care,' Bianca replied. 'I've got to get well and get out of here as soon as possible. It's urgent. It's a matter of ...' She was going to say life and death, but that could mean anything; like, for example that she'd managed to get seats for the Shrunken Heads concert at the NEC and didn't want to waste them. 'The future of the human race,' she said, 'is hanging in the balance here. It's _essential_ —'\n\n'Hey,' the doctor interrupted, 'you mean you got tickets for the Heads gig? You wouldn't consider selling them, would you?'\n\nHaving your right arm in plaster means you can only hit doctors with your left; unless you're a natural southpaw, this can be a nuisance. 'Shut _up,'_ Bianca snapped. 'Look. Sixteen people, one of them quite possibly a close friend, have died. Most likely, that's only the beginning. The only person who can stop it is me. So name your frigging price and let's get on with it.'\n\n'My price? You mean for the tickets? Well—'\n\n'For the operation,' Bianca hissed.\n\nChronotherapy, also known as Injury Time; a new breakthrough in medical science, brought to you by the pharmaceuticals wing of Chubby Stevenson (Time) Inc.\n\nWhat nearly all medicine boils down to is: leave the human body alone and comfortable, and in Time it'll sort itself out. But if you haven't got Time, this is a non-starter. So; either you die, or bits fall off you, or you buy more Time.\n\nIt's an entirely private and personal envelope of additional Time shoe-horned into an ordinary day - one second in real time, but up to three months as far as the user is concerned, during which bones knit, scars heal, muscles rebuild and so on. Since it's a very small-scale temporal field, it only takes a tiny drop of the raw stuff-less than one microlitre, street value currently £100,000. Double that for the shoe-horn, installation costs, credulity suspension jigs and tooling, the doctor's and Chubby's profit. Fortunately, the sensational manner in which she'd received her injuries (Sultry Brunette In Bomb Horror) had sent her market values rocketing, and she'd arranged a few sales of old bits of junk she'd had cluttering her studio which more than covered the cost.\n\nLater, Bianca was to remember it as the most boring second of her life.\n\nMike arrived, dishevelled and out of breath, to find he was already there.\n\nThis worried him. True, his aggravating vagueness and extremely flexible attitude to punctuality had frequently led people to suggest that one of these days he'd be late for his own funeral. On the other hand, he'd always assumed that they'd have the common courtesy to wait for him. Apparently not so.\n\n'We therefore commit his body to the earth,' said the priest, 'dust to dust, ashes to ...'\n\n'Hey!' he shouted. Nobody heard him. He watched with incredulous fury as they started to fill in the grave. It was like watching a waiter take away your meal before you'd had a chance to unfold your table napkin, let alone start eating. One thing did, however, suggest at least a degree of normality. Nobody had told him anything and he hadn't got a clue what was going on. That made him feel more comfortable. He could cope now.\n\n'Good turnout,' said a voice to his immediate right. 'You must feel proud.'\n\nThe voice was coming from a large, florid Victorian weeping angel. She'd seen better days; acid rain, vandalism and the trainee assistant gardener (who sharpened his billhook on her marble ankle) had all taken their toll, leaving her looking like something found in a sink-trap. Mike recoiled slightly.\n\n'Be like that,' the angel said, apparently not offended. 'Let's face it, you're no oil painting yourself; although, that said, in a bad light you'd pass for a second-rate Jackson Pollock.'\n\n'I beg your pardon?'\n\nThe statue sighed. 'Sorry,' it said, 'I forgot, you're new. Find a puddle or something, take a look at yourself. Or rather,' she added quickly, 'don't. Probably best if you remember yourself the way you used to be.'\n\nMike sat down on a tombstone. As he did so, he studied the process. As far as he could tell, he was solid and real; he could feel the stone against his trousered leg, and when he tried to pass his arm through an ornate granite cross, it wouldn't go. He tried again, only harder; when he banged his wrist on the stone it hurt, and a little smear of blood showed in the graze. In one sense, reassuring; in another, disconcerting.\n\n'Neat trick, isn't it?' said the angel, who had been watching. 'Feels just like the real thing, but isn't. All a matter of timing, you see.'\n\n'Timing?'\n\n'That's right.' The statue yawned. 'God,' she said, 'why's it always me who's got to do this? I don't get paid for explaining to new recruits, I just do it because I'm here. And,' she added, 'because I feel sorry for you, bless your poor disoriented souls. And because I've got absolutely nothing else to do. Still, I really do think it's time they did something official, it's a scandal if you ask me. I mean, there's all those preparing-for-retirement courses you can go on, so the shock of not having to work won't send you to an early grave; but the biggest and most radical change of your entire existence, you're supposed to be able to fend for yourself, puzzle it out from first principles. Cheapskate, I call it.'\n\nMike took a deep breath - presumably it was a deep breath and not just some virtual reality programmer's placebo. 'If you'd explain,' he said, 'I personally would be very grateful.'\n\n'That's all right,' said the angel, 'you're welcome. Look, forget what I said about timing for the moment, it always confuses people. Think of a radio, right?'\n\nMike thought of a radio.\n\n'Now then,' the statue continued, 'there's hundreds, maybe thousands of different radio signals blamming about simultaneously, but the radio only picks them up one at a time. That's because it's tuned in to one specific frequency.' The angel paused. 'Nobody told me this, by the way,' she added. 'I had to work it out for myself. It's true, though, 'cos I had it confirmed by Official Channels when I asked them. They're very good about answering enquiries, so long as you don't forget the stamped addressed envelope.'\n\n'Please go on,' Mike said. 'Like radio waves, you said.'\n\n'Sure.' The angel thought for a moment, remembering where she'd got to. 'Well, just as there's lots of different radio frequencies, there's lots of different chronological continuums. Continua. Timescales. That's a better word, although I shouldn't use it because it's got a separate technical meaning. Strictly speaking, timescale is the residue left after hard time's been boiled down in a copper kettle.'\n\n'Ah.'\n\n'Forget I said that. Different timescales. Now, in the timescale which human mortal life is tuned in to, a second lasts—' She stopped. 'Sorry, got in a bit of a tangle there. Should have done the weights-and-measures spiel before I started. Let's put all that on one side for the time being and stick to Terrestrial Orthodox. As far as you're concerned, a second lasts one second, right?'\n\n'Right.'\n\n'Wrong. A second only lasts a second in your own specific timescale, HMS - that's Human Mortal Standard. That's what you were tuned in to when you were alive. Now you're dead, you're tuned in to HDS, Human Deceased Standard. One second HMS is equivalent to 0.8342 seconds HDS; or 0.0062 seconds SIS, Supernatural Immortal Standard; or 0.000147, SITS, Soul In Torment Standard; or—'\n\n'All right,' Mike said, 'got that. How does that mean I don't exist but I can't walk through tombstones?'\n\nBeing a statue, the angel couldn't shrug, but by extra-subtle voice modulation it did the vocal equivalent. 'Don't exist is a bit of an overstatement,' she said, 'and it's a very complex bit of maths, which I'm still not sure I completely follow. The analogy is, though, think of the radio signals. They're all there, but you can only listen to one at a time. Now, turning back to timescales, think of yourself as the radio signal.'\n\n'Fine. Here am I going bleep bleep. Who's being the radio?'\n\nAnother, broader verbal shrug. 'This is a difficult concept to put across,' she said. 'Basically, the world is the radio, your fellow sentient beings are - no pun intended, promise - the cat's whiskers. Do you see what I'm getting at? You exist, you're here, no question about that. The tombstone there is inanimate - either that, or it's very, very shy, because we've been standing next to each other since 1897 and it's never said a word - and so it couldn't notice you even if it wanted to. Doesn't matter a damn what a tombstone thinks. But living creatures are different; they're all tuned in to their own timescale, and so they just don't see anybody who's in a timescale faster than their own. Dead people move too quick; you know, the magic lantern effect. Marvellous system when you come to think of it, bloody efficient way to store billions of people on a relatively small planet.'\n\nThere was a substantial pause while Mike let it all sink in. 'I see,' he said. 'So do I still have to eat and sleep and so on? Do I still have to go to work and earn money, or is everything free, or don't I need anything? Can I have things even if I don't need them?'\n\n'The question doesn't arise,' the angel replied. 'Life expectancy of a dead human's no more than three days, four days maximum. At the end of that time, either you find an empty property in Mortality you can slip into, or else - phut.'\n\n'Phut?'\n\n'Phut. That's yet another gross simplification,' the angel went on apologetically, 'but so what, I'm pretty shaky on the theory from now on. What actually happens, I think, is that you start to speed up to such an extent that Time just zips by in a meaningless blur and before you know it, you've reached the End of the Universe, entropy time, the big nothing; like you've fast-forwarded and there you are at the end of the tape. What happens after that is beyond me. Maybe they wind it back, maybe they take it back to the library and get out another one. Let's put it this way, you'll know the answer to that particular part of the story long before I will, so if you can, be sure to send me a postcard. I say that to all the new arrivals,' the angel added, 'and I've never had anything from any of them. But maybe they just forgot.'\n\n'Four days?'\n\n'Four days tops.'\n\nMike felt ill. The gravestone was still there under his backside, the breeze was still a little on the chilly side, but he felt as if he was already hurtling past, like a child on a combination merry-go-round and Ferris wheel. 'You said something about an empty property,' he remembered. 'What's that all about?'\n\n'Thought you'd ask,' replied the angel. 'They always do.\n\nJust occasionally, you can slip back in. Sounds nice, but isn't.'\n\n'No?'\n\n'Wouldn't fancy it myself,' the angel replied. 'The reason being, you don't go back into HMS time, so you can't be a human or a cat or a golden eagle or stuff like that. Returns go in HIA time, and that's - well, weird, really. Look at me.'\n\n'You?'\n\n'Me. HIA; Human Irregular Anomaly. We exist in all timescales simultaneously. We're in some more strongly than in others, true, and in practice you ignore everything except HMS, HDS and a few others because - come on, let's ride this radio analogy until it falls to bits - the signals are faint, crackly and in Norwegian. Anyway, that's what happened to me. I came back as a statue. No bloody fun at all.'\n\n'A statue?'\n\n'That's right. More of us about than you'd think.' The angel's voice was getting softer and softer, slower and slower, as though its batteries were running down fast. 'The thing to remember about HIA is, it's very, very...'\n\n'Yes? _Yes_?'\n\n'Boring.'\n\nA fraction of a second later, the statue was just a statue; you could tell just by looking at it that it was no more alive than a cellarful of coal. Run down? Asleep? Switched off? No way of knowing. Mike stood up, felt pins and needles from his knee to his ankle.\n\nFour days ...\n\n_Ninety-nine per cent light speed_!\n\nHead forward, wings back, tail streaming behind him, the dragon bulleted on through the murderous slipstream. His scales glowed cherry-red, and the tears streaming from his eyes boiled before they ever reached his cheeks. His eardrums, at a guess, were halfway down his throat. It was just as well he couldn't open his mouth, because air pressure would have snapped his lower jaw off at the hinge.\n\nUgh, he thought -\n\nwwhhyyyy aaammm IIIII ddoooiiiiiinngg tthhiiiiissssss?\n\nBecause if I don't, that creep Chubby will blow me to Kingdom Come (or, relatively speaking, quite possibly Kingdom Went; wherever, I don't want to go there).\n\nAnd because there's a certain unbelievable thrill in peeling back the final frontier; shit-scaredly going where everybody else has already gone before, but not yet. As it were.\n\nAnd, last but not least, because I've got nothing better to do.\n\nBANG!\n\nLight speed ...\n\nOne very pertinent fact about travelling faster than light—\n\n' _Ouch_!'\n\n\\- is that it's bloody dark and you can't see where you're going. And, at that sort of speed, even a collision with a high-flying clothes moth takes on the stature of a major railway accident.\n\nFortunately, he regained consciousness just in time to pull out of his headlong spin, wrench his battered and groaning body up out of the way of mountains and airliners and jack-knife agonisingly back to straight and level. It was still as dark as thirty feet down a drain, which meant he hadn't lost speed. What he needed now was lots and lots of height.\n\nHey though, he crowed in the back lots of his subconscious, this is quite something. No way those two-legged groundling midgets could do this, for all their precious technology. For a dragon, however, it's just a matter of flying. You do know how to fly, don't you? You just put your wings together and go ...\n\n_'Help!'_\n\nGoing this fast, you lose all track of Time. Or Time loses all track of you. The only semi-constant is the pain; you're being beadblasted with photons, every square millimetre of your body surface is white hot, a grain of dust hits you like a cannon shell. You only continue to exist because entropy hasn't caught up with you yet. But it will.\n\n_Beeeeep!_\n\nWhat? Oh, Christ, yes, Chubby's idiotic signal. I can slow down now, just when I was beginning to enjoy myself.\n\nThe lights came back on, and then the dragon was no longer faster-than-light, just very fast; racing, but no longer against the clock. Now then, the trick is, decelerate slowly. In this context, sudden slowth would hit like a brick wall.\n\nThe sound came back on. The vertical hold adjusted itself. God had fiddled with the aerial.\n\n_Congratulations_! _We all knew you had it in you_!\n\nWhat the hell? The dragon's brain cleared and he realised it was a pre-recorded message, playing tinnily and at not quite the right speed through a miniature speaker inside his ear. He slowed down a little more.\n\n_Please proceed to the following co-ordinates. Longitude ..._\n\n'Fuck you!' the dragon howled. 'I haven't got a map!'\n\n... _Sixteen minutes west; or, in layman's terms, the bookstall in Rockefeller Plaza. You will there buy a copy of the New York_ Times _and turn to page four. Estimated you will arrive in nine, repeat nine, minutes._\n\nHigh over New York, the dragon found out what the parcel was for. As his dragon body suddenly vanished and he felt a rather different, more vindictive slipstream tearing at his human incarnation, he realised that it was a parachute.\n\nNew Yorkers are hard to faze. A windswept man with streaming eyes and untidy hair parachuting down onto the concourse at Grand Central is, to them, just another guy trying to beat the rush hour. So finely tuned is the New Yorker's inbuilt radar that they got out of his way as he landed without even looking at him.\n\nHe picked himself up. No need to dispose of the parachute; in the second and a half during which he'd been rolling on the ground feeling acute pain in both knees, the parachute had been unbuckled, stolen and spirited away. By now, it'd probably been converted into three hundred silk handkerchiefs in a lock-up somewhere in Queens.\n\nFeeling slightly shaky and, for once, almost out of his depth, he tottered to the bookstall, picked up a newspaper and looked at the date. All that trouble and effort, and he'd fast-forwarded six lousy weeks.\n\nHe turned to page four, as ordered, jotted down the closing prices. Then the sports pages, then the lottery results. Then, out of curiosity, he glanced to the front page.\n\nAnd saw a headline.\n\nThe _Times,_ which isn't your run-of-the-mill sensationalist fishwrap, had let its hair down. There were screamingly vivid action pictures, BIG headlines, interviews with witnesses, angles, turn to page six, continued on page seven. It was a BIG story, full of twists, nuances, implications. There was even a three-column feature by one D. Bennett, linking the bizarre events to Contragate, the Bermuda Triangle and the assassination of Abe Lincoln.\n\nThe gist of the story, however, was straightforward enough.\n\nTwelve hours ago, in Mongolia, Saint George had killed the Dragon.\n\nMike didn't sleep well.\n\nFor one thing, since he was going to die, fast-forward, phut, whatever, in four days, he begrudged the time. Also, although he'd never been particularly superstitious, kipping down in a graveyard didn't appeal to him, particularly since he now had the feeling that he'd be able to see his fellow deadies and maybe they weren't very nice to look at ... Mostly, though, he couldn't sleep because he was worried.\n\nFour days to find a - what the hell was it he was looking for? An anomaly, he supposed, but what the hell does an anomaly look like? Apparently, like a statue.\n\nNot any old statue, though; he'd already tried that. There were plenty of statues in the graveyard and he'd knocked loudly on each one, prodded them for disguised doors and escape hatches, even tried climbing in through ears and open mouths. Failure. By the time he'd finished, he was beginning to hallucinate _No Vacancies_ signs.\n\nA statue.\n\nA _statue._\n\nJesus, yes, a _statue!_ Piece of cake, surely, because wasn't the most gifted living sculptress (despair is the mother of exaggeration) a personal friend of his, who also happened to owe him one hell of a favour?\n\nBy the time he'd worked that out, it was half past six and the buses were starting to run. He caught the thirty-seven, which went to the hospital. Buses are inanimate (although they're capable of malice; ask anybody who's run after one, only to watch it draw away from the kerb at the last minute) and accordingly was solid and real enough for him to get on board without falling through the floor. He had no trouble finding a seat, in spite of the fact that there was standing room only.\n\nBut.\n\nAll right, so Bianca can sculpt me a statue to live in; central heating, air conditioned, all mod cons. First, though, I've got to find a way to get a message through to her. How the hell do I do that, exactly?\n\nBy the time the bus drew up outside the hospital gate, the only answer that had occurred to him was, _improvise._ Well, he could do worse.\n\nBianca stirred.\n\nPrecisely one second ago, she'd been very ill; Bianca the human jigsaw, held together with skin, plaster and force of habit. Now, though, she could feel the integrity of her newly restored bones. She was fit, strong, ready to face the incredibly daunting task now facing her. She was also, of course, covered from head to foot in plaster and her limbs were tied to the ceiling with thick wire.\n\n'Hello!' she shouted. 'Nurse! I think I'm better now, can I get up?'\n\nNeedless to say, they ignored her, and an alarming thought walked flat-footed across the wet concrete of her mind. Maybe they wouldn't believe she was better and were going to keep her like this for another six weeks anyway?\n\nIt was then that the table began to move.\n\nAt first, Bianca put it down to a heavy lorry trundling by in the road below. When it stopped simply wobbling and began to tap-dance, she began to wonder.\n\n'Mike?' she whispered.\n\nGrimly, Mike lifted the chair and tapped out a phrase: _'cos I'll be there, puttin'on ma top hat, tying up ma white tie—_\n\n'Mike,' Bianca said sternly, 'stop making that awful noise, you'll disturb the other patients.'\n\nThe table stopped moving. Feeling very foolish—girl gets bang on head, starts talking to thin air, and you're saying she's ready to go home? Get real, nurse, please - she whispered, 'Mike.'\n\nNo reply.\n\n'Mike, if you want to, er, communicate ...' God, how? 'Don't try and answer. Look, I'll think of something.' What? Hell. She looked round. Lying at the foot of the bed was one of those horrid comics.\n\n'Can you pick up that magazine?'\n\nThe pages riffled.\n\n'Good. I'll pretend to be reading it.' She picked it up. 'To answer, turn the pages till you find something that's as close as you can get to what you want to say.'\n\nRiffle. The magazine was now open at the agony column. 'You've got a problem you want help with?'\n\nRiffle. In front of her was a feature, _Mortgage Repossession Left My Family Homeless._\n\n'You're in financial difficulties? Mike, you're dead, how can you be in ...?'\n\nRiffle. _Exchanging Contracts: Part Four in our series on moving house._\n\nBianca thought for a moment. 'You're homeless? You've got nowhere to go?'\n\nRiffle. She looked down and saw the front cover. The name of the magazine was _Yes!_\n\n'I see,' Bianca said, inaccurately. 'So how can I help?'\n\nRiffle. Article on improving your garden. Photograph; petunias, flowering cherry, crab apple tree, herbacious border, garden gnomes ...\n\n'You want me to plant a tree for you? Is that it?'\n\nRiffle. Another photograph; view of Piccadilly Circus. Further riffle. View of Trafalgar Square. Further riffle. For Only _£_ 99.99 You Can Own This Beautiful Porcelain Figurine...\n\n'A _statue?_ You want me to carve you a statue?'\n\nRiffle. Front cover.\n\n'But...' Bianca was going to say Why? Then she thought of the dragon, and George, and she knew why.\n\n. 'Mike, I'm sort of busy right now, can it wait? You see, first I've got to get out of here, then I've got to find that dragon - you know, my statue - and stop him blowing things up, so if you could give me six weeks or so ...'\n\nFurious riffles. Advertisement. Flabstrippers' Guarantee : Lose Six Pounds in Three Days or Your Money Back.\n\n'Three days?' Front cover. 'Mike, that's impossible, I—'\n\nThe magazine flew from her hands, soared up into the air and parachuted down, pages flapping like the wings of a shot crow. The table rocked violently and fell over. The chair began to tap out _Dancin' Cheek to Cheek._\n\n'All _right,'_ she hissed, as the sister came running. 'I'll see what I can do.'\n**CHAPTER TWELVE**\n\n**'I** t's obvious what we've gotta do,' Kurt replied impatiently.\n\n'We've gotta leave the country.'\n\nSeventeen former statues looked at him as though he were mad, making him grateful his band wasn't a democracy. He did his best to ignore them.\n\n'Leave the country?' David asked. 'Why?'\n\nDavid had, somehow, been elevated to the rank of spokesman-cum-courier; that is to say, the other ex-statues tended to hem him in and hiss, 'Go on, _you_ tell him,' in his ear. They also complained to him about the food, the transport and the accommodation; remember, although their outward husks were Italian, inside they were British.\n\n'Because,' Kurt replied, still wondering what in blazes had led him to go back for this miserable lot, 'we've got this job to do. And we can't do it here. Okay?'\n\n'Don't think we can leave the country,' muttered the Giambologna _Mercury._ 'We'd need special export licences, surely.'\n\n'Stolen property,' agreed a Bernini bronze. 'They got these computerised lists, international, worldwide. I saw it on _Lovejoy._ We'd never get past the duty-free lounge.'\n\nAmateurs, muttered Kurt to himself. 'Absolutely right,' he sighed, the sarcasm going so far over his listeners' heads that you could have bounced radio signals off it. 'That's why we've gotta hijack a plane.'\n\nThat left them speechless; but not for long enough. A Donatello Crucifixion objected that surely hijacking was illegal. The Canova demanded to speak to the manager. Kurt bashed the packing case with his fist for silence.\n\n'Okay,' he snarled, 'that's it. I've had enough of this goddamn whimpering out of you guys. The next one of you I hear any shit from ends up at the bottom of the Arno with a human being tied to his ankle. You got that? Good. Now then, this is the plan.'\n\nIn the shocked silence that followed, it occurred to Kurt that he hadn't yet formulated a plan. Kurt Lundqvist without. a plan; impossible. Easier to imagine a Tory minister without a mistress. Something would occur to him, it always did.\n\n'The plan,' he went on, 'is, naturally, top secret. I'll announce the various stages in due course, on a strictly need-to-know basis. The first stage is getting to the air terminal. This is what we do.'\n\nKurt spent the rest of the day shoplifting, hotwiring vehicles, breaking into police station armouries, mugging tourists for their passports, faking photographs, wiring up al fresco bombs and generally relaxing after all the strain he'd been through lately dealing with objects only one step away from being people. By one o'clock in the morning, he felt refreshed and invigorated. He now had at his disposal a carabinieri armoured van, eighteen assault rifles, ditto Beretta 9mm handguns, three cases of grenades, five twenty-pounder bombs, flak jackets, black balaclavas, matching ski-suits, two-way radios, state-of-the-art communications and radio jamming equipment, sandwiches, chocolate and a thermos flask of decaffeinated coffee.\n\nAt three am precisely, air traffic control received an ominous message on the security hotline. Flight TCA8494 from Istanbul, scheduled to refuel before heading on to London, due to arrive at 03.24, had armed hijackers on board. They'd wired up bombs, and were demanding the release of prisoners and a huge cash ransom. A special security team was on its way; in the meantime, act naturally, refuel the plane, pretend nothing untoward is happening. Message received and understood.\n\nAt 03.34, the carabinieri van drew up at a side gate. Kurt flashed an impressive-looking pass (actually an Academy Museum season ticket, but it was dark and Kurt kept his thumb over the words) under the sentry's nose, hissed a few words in his ear and was let through. At 03.40, eighteen shadowy, ferociously armed figures scrambled up the gangway into the plane and burst into the passenger compartment.\n\n'Okay!' Kurt roared. 'Nobody move!' He paused, for effect. 'Okay,' he said, 'where's the hijackers?'\n\nThe cabin staff stared at him. They were just rewinding the in-flight movie, handing out the freeby glossy magazines. 'What hijackers?' they said.\n\nKurt assumed a pained expression. 'Jesus, not _another_ false alarm,' he sighed. 'You _sure_ there hasn't been a hijack?'\n\nThe purser nodded. 'We'd have noticed,' he said.\n\n'Not necessarily,' Kurt replied, motioning to his team to fan out, start frisking the passengers. 'Like, there's these new fundamentalist religious fanatics, some name like Meek Militant Action. Their aim's to inherit the Earth, provided nobody objects. We'd better check things out, just to be sure.'\n\nThe purser, who had the muzzle of a Heckler & Koch G3 sticking in his ear - not because he was a suspect, it was just rather a cramped aircraft - shrugged and nodded. 'Suit yourselves, guys,' he said. 'Better safe than sorry, I guess. While you're at it, would you mind taking round the duty-frees?'\n\nKurt's men duly searched; wonder of wonders, they found no fewer than five twenty-pound bombs wired up to the doors, fuel lines and in-flight catering packs. Gee, muttered Kurt, just as I thought. We'd better stay with this flight till it gets to London. What a truly splendid idea, the captain replied, his subconscious wrestling with the problem of where he'd seen some of these guys before (you don't like to say to a SWAT team officer that you're sorry, you didn't recognise him with his clothes on). While they were at it, he added, maybe they could help out with serving the meals and checking the seat-belts.\n\nAs the plane took off, a Bernini took Kurt aside and asked him to explain something.\n\n'Thought we were meant to be hijacking the plane,' he said.\n\nKurt nodded. 'Neat job, huh?'\n\n'But we're pretending to be the army. The good guys.'\n\n'So?'\n\n'Does that mean we're the good guys or the bad guys? I'm confused.'\n\nKurt shook his head. The ignorance of some people. 'Son,' he said, 'I'm gonna tell you something that's gonna help you a lot in years to come, supposing you last that long. Good guys is just a fancy way of saying Us. Bad guys is only ever Them. You remember that, you won't go far wrong. Okay?'\n\n'But what about moral imperatives? What about Good and Evil?'\n\nThe Bernini suddenly found himself about a centimetre from Kurt's taut face and industrial-laser eyes. 'Where I come from,' he said, 'Evil's a stunt man's Christian name. Now go over there, sit down and shut up. Does that answer your question?'\n\n'Comprehensively.'\n\n'Great. Always knew I shoulda been a philosopher.'\n\nAttack philosopher, naturally.\n\nAlthough the dragon had immediately recognised the sheer brilliance of Chubby's method of travelling back through Time, he'd had an intuitive feeling from the outset that there was one tiny flaw in it somewhere. Now, back in the air and soaring at ninety thousand feet over Angola, he knew for certain what it was.\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nTwenty-seven hours he'd been up here; twice round the predetermined circuit, airspeed and course exactly as specified to the knot, to the metre. All he'd managed to achieve was to distance himself from home by a further twenty-seven hours. Bloody marvellous.\n\nBy the time he was overflying Botswana, he'd worked it out. The course as plotted was half an hour out of synch; the fools hadn't taken into account the time he'd be spending on the ground. He cursed them and himself; if he'd spotted the mistake earlier, he might just have been able to compensate. By now, though, the history nodes would all have moved on so far that it'd be impossible to rechart the course without all of Chubby's formulae, calculating software and history-industry infiltrators' input. He was stuck.\n\nWhen in shit, use brain. All the necessary kit would, of course, still be in Chubby's office. All he had to do was drop in, explain the problem - or would Chubby be expecting him? After all, once he got back he'd tell him all about it, with the result that by the time they got back here, sorry, _now,_ Chubby would already _know—_ but if that was the case, he'd have known to correct the error in the first place, oh _fuck,_ this is complicated ...\n\nHe flew, nevertheless, to Chubby's office, only to find it boarded up, with no forwarding address. Nothing in the phone book. No trace anywhere. Maybe when he got back he was going to roast Chubby alive (sorely tempted), which in turn would mean no Chubby now, just when he needed him most. Hey, maybe it really _is_ impossible to travel backwards in Time. Starting to look that way, no question.\n\nHe slowed down, drifting gracefully high above Madagascar. The hell with this, let's try another way.\n\nSuch as?\n\nIf you don't know, his old mother used to say, ask someone who does.\n\nThink, dragon, think.\n\nThirty-two hours ago, he'd seen a newspaper headline saying that twelve hours before that, he'd been killed. Okay.\n\nIf I was killed before I got here, then it stands to reason that I got back in time to be killed before I got here. Therefore I, the late lamented I, _requiescam in pace,_ must know how I got back. So I should ask myself. Only that's going to be tricky, because I'm dead.\n\nTricky, but possible. Because - give me strength! - in order to have gotten back, I must have asked myself how to do it. My dead self must therefore know that my living self is going to want to make contact, approximately now, and will be waiting in for the call, wherever the flying fuck I/he now am/is. Stands to reason.\n\nOkay, here goes. Just hope I know what I'm doing.\n\nHe peered down. Zululand. Well, why not?\n\nThere are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than give you nightmares in your philosophy.\n\nFew stranger, more wonderful or more terrible, however, than the _isangoma_ —translated, with typical Colonial crass-ness, 'witch-doctor' - of southern Africa. Now, of course, extinct; no place for that sort of thing in the twentieth century. Well, of course.\n\nAlthough he knew virtually nothing about the subject, the dragon was at least able to address the small, shrivelled man sitting in front of him on a low, carved stool by his correct title: _amakhosi,_ 'my lords', plural, because when you speak to the _isangoma_ you're talking not to the little old man but to the countless mighty spirits who bed-and-breakfast, so to speak, in the vast mansions behind his eyes.\n\nNkunzana's small, tidy kraal lay in a miniature valley, a crack between two great rocks, which meant the sun's nuisance was kept to a minimum. For twenty hours in the twenty-four it was dark at Izulu-li-dum-umteto, and for Nkunzana darkness was a natural resource essential to his business, like the mill-streams of Lancashire. He himself was a comic, horrifying figure; small, crooked and smooth-skinned, like a freeze-dried child. He wore the uniform of his craft: leopards' teeth, goats' horns, pigs' bladders, gnu's tail. He looked like God's spares box. Slow to move, quick to laugh; smiling toothlessly, staring unblinking at a space two feet above and eight inches to the right of the head of the person he was talking to. A little ray of sunshine. Your local GP.\n\n_'Sakubona, baba'._ We saw you, my father; hello. A grave nod accompanied the formal greeting. The dragon relaxed a little. He'd managed to get to see the doctor without an appointment. 'And what can I do for you?'\n\nThe dragon licked the roof of his mouth, which was dry; _why am I afraid of this little toe-rag? I'm a dragon, for crying_ out _loud ..._ 'I need to speak to someone who is dead, _'makhosi,'_ he replied, a little nervousness spilling out with the words. 'For you, surely, this is possible.'\n\n'Possible.' The little man nodded. 'A small matter, my father. Who among the snakes do you wish to talk to?'\n\nThe dragon hesitated. 'This is, um, embarrassing.'\n\n'Relax. Say the name.'\n\n'Well - look, how would it be if I wrote it down on a bit of paper? Sorry to be all silly about this, but—'\n\n'I cannot read, my father. Say the name.'\n\n'All right. Um. Me.'\n\n'You?'\n\nNod. 'Me.'\n\nLong pause.\n\n_'Wo, ndoda; ngitshilo.'_ Hey, man, you sure said a mouthful. 'Talking to yourself is a sign of madness. Talking to yourself, dead, is class.'\n\nThe dragon shuffled. 'Said it was embarrassing. Can you do it?'\n\nNkunzana shrugged. 'Why not?' he said. 'If it's possible. If not, not.'\n\n'It's possible. Cross my heart and hope to die. Er, be dead.'\n\n'We will see what we can do, my father.' The old man closed his eyes, leaned forward until his knees touched his shoulders, and tossed something onto the fire. Nothing happened.\n\n'About time, too,' said the dragon.\n\nThe dragon looked up. 'Aarg,' he said.\n\n'Have you any idea,' his deceased self went on, 'how long I've been hanging around this boghole waiting for you to turn up? Gives me the fucking creeps, and I'm _dead.'_\n\n'Sorry.' Really, truly embarrassing. 'Look, I guess you know why I needed to talk.'\n\n'Reverse time travel, how we got home.' The dragon nodded. 'Piece of cake. Why you needed to bother me I don't know. I managed to work it out all by myself.'\n\n'Clever old you, then.'\n\n'Indeed.' The dragon sighed contemptuously. 'Listen carefully. I'm dead, right?'\n\n'Right.'\n\n'But I can't be, or I couldn't be talking to me, right? Say yes.'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Therefore I must be alive. Nod.'\n\nThe dragon nodded.\n\n'And if I'm alive now, I must have been alive six weeks ago. Well?'\n\n'Obviously.'\n\n'Okay.' The dragon grinned. 'There you are, then.'\n\nAnd there they weren't, either of them.\n\nFor ten minutes or so, Nkunzana sat, gazing at the empty stool. Then he stood up, threw another log on the fire.\n\n_'Hambla gahle,'_ he said quietly, go in peace. 'I'm Logic, fly me.' He shook his head, picked up his catskin bag of medicines and walked to his hut.\n\nIt only occurred to him when he reached the doorway. He stopped dead, swore, _('Wangi hudela umtwana wami!')_ and banged his head savagely against the lintel. Bloody old fool.\n\nAll that work, unsocial hours, and who the hell was he going to send the invoice to?\n\nBianca's arm ached, the newly mended bone resenting the heavy vibration of hammer on chisel on stone. She glanced up at the clock. No time to rest, she observed mournfully. Not even time for a quick brew and a garibaldi biscuit. She raised the chisel, positioned it carefully, tapped gently. Boy, was she _tired._\n\nIt was starting to take its toll. Already her hand had slipped, uncharacteristically, when she'd been doing the left side of the collar bone. Oh dear, what a shame, never mind. The old Mike had always had a chip on his shoulder. Now he had a chip out of it; same difference.\n\nDo the head last, shrieked her common sense. Just in case the bloody thing comes alive before I've finished it. Last thing I need is Mike's head looking over my shoulder, telling me how I should do my job. Probably try and sweet-talk me into making improvements on the original. No prize for guessing what he'd want improved.\n\nFurthermore, once this job was finished, no chance of taking a day off or putting her feet up. The moment she'd finished Mike, she had a dragon to find and reason with. And what if the wretched thing wouldn't listen to reason? Then what the hell was she supposed to do?\n\nShe paused, brushed away chippings and thought hard. Why me, anyway? Go on, then, if you're so damn clever.\n\nThe trouble was, she could feel reasons there under her skin, like the palmed coin hidden in the magician's handkerchief. It _had_ to be her, because ... Well, because she believed in what was going on - not through choice, but because she knew it was all horribly true - and she knew full well that nobody else would believe her. If she tried to enlist the help of the proper authorities (Police? Army? Church? No idea), they'd have her inside a fruitcake repository and connected up to the mains before she got much further than, 'Well, it's like this...' Because she owed it to the dragon for the wrongs her species had done to his species - No, the hell with that. Follow that line of argument and she'd be pouring petrol through delicatessens' letterboxes. Because it was her statues that started it all. That was the reason. Very silly reason; holding herself responsible for the acts of a bunch of semi-legendary joyriders. But it was the reason and she was stuck with it.\n\nBut what was she to do if the dragon wouldn't listen to her? An entrancing picture floated before her mind; the damsel fights the dragon to save the knight chained to the rock. Great feminist statement; bloody silly game plan. And how do you go about fighting dragons, anyway?\n\n'Reluctantly,' Bianca said aloud. 'Copper mallet, copper mallet, come out wherever you are.'\n\nThree hours later, there wasn't much left to do. The face - well, far be it from her to seek to amend Mother Nature's banjax. The small of the back and the bum; there is a destiny that shapes our ends, she muttered to herself laying in hard with the chisel, rough-hew them how we will. In this instance, it had shaped Mike's end rather like a very old, tired sofa. There were lots of untidy chisel-marks, but his trousers would hide those. Time Mike learnt to take the rough with the smooth.\n\nChip chip, tap tap. 'All right,' she said. 'It's ready. Phase One in an exciting new development of starter-homes for unfussy ghosts.'\n\nShe waited.\n\nSlight miscalculation? Maybe. Or maybe a very precise calculation indeed.\n\nBelow him, the dragon saw the still-smoking embers of the hall. A gaggle of peculiar-shaped creatures, led by a human, were picking their way through the hot-rubble towards a beat-up old motor vehicle. They got in and drove away.\n\n_Banzai_! He'd come back in a day or so earlier than scheduled, just nicely in time to see George and his sidekicks clambering out of their incinerator and making a run for it. Maintaining his height, he tracked the van; wingbeats few and slow, a handy thermal buoying him up.\n\nHe was, he hoped, too high for the wretched creatures in the van to see or notice, although what could they do if they did? Drive faster than light? Try and defend themselves? Attack? Let them. The dragon was wearing under his metaphorical dinner jacket the bullet-proof vest of zombie-hood; _you can't get me 'cos I done dead already._ Looking ahead up the road, he picked his spot. Fire? Twelve good nosefuls before he was into reserve. He accelerated, put his wings back, fell into the glide ...\n\n'George.'\n\n'Now what?'\n\n'There's a dragon following us.'\n\nThe van had slewed to a sudden dramatic standstill and its contents were dispersing at top speed. Drat, the dragon thought. Never mind, he was locked on to George now; he didn't care about the others, as soon let them go as not, provided they didn't interfere. And they wouldn't. Not many demons are prepared to lay down their lives for a saint.\n\nNice to watch George run. For a short, fattish lad he had a pretty turn of speed. Slippery, too, as soap in a bath, so no time for mucking about. It's when the stage villain pauses to twirl his moustaches and cackle that the hero sees his chance and the underwriters of his life policies start to breathe again. Time to nail the sod.\n\nHe dived, breathed in. A smart sneeze, pinpoint accurate. A very loud, _very_ short scream. Job done.\n\nHome.\n\nOh.\n\nSo that was death, was it? Typical, I missed it.\n\nGeorge watched the dragon recede into the sky, then looked down; although he knew there'd be nothing to see. His body—gone. Which body? Didn't matter. The jet of fire that had wrapped round him like a cat round legs had been so hot it'd have evaporated marble as easily as flesh. An exemplary snuff; quick, sure and completely (as far as he could remember) painless.\n\nGeorge was suddenly aware of something -\n\n\\- God knows what. The nearest he could get to it was an invisible lead, dragging him like an over-inquisitive dog. Balls, muttered George, I'm going to Heaven. Don't want to go yet. Haven't finished.\n\nDon't have to go. As the unseen rope tugged him along, he was aware of a handhold, an escape hatch, rushing towards him. An anomaly! Saved!\n\nThere's many a slip, as the saying goes, between toilet bowl and sewage farm. George only saw it for the most fleeting sliver of a second, but it was long enough to judge his escape attempt and make it.\n\nA statue, its back door wide open. In fact, so conveniently placed, handy for the stream of traffic, that you'd be forgiven for thinking it had been put there expressly for the purpose. A mousetrap? Or a getaway car?\n\nWhatever; who gives a shit? As far as George was concerned, it was a case of any portrait in a storm. He threw himself at the anomaly and hit the mark.\n\n'Mike? You in there yet?'\n\nComing, coming. Being dead takes it out of you, makes you realise just how out of condition you can become in three days. Painfully, Mike dragged himself towards the nice welcoming statue. Dear, kind, clever Bianca, she'd done a good job. Almost there ...\n\nWhat? _What?_\n\n_BASTARD!_\n\nJust as the door in the back of the statue opened and he'd been reaching out a frail and shaky arm to touch it, some evil git had bounced up from behind, swept past him, jumped into the statue and slammed the door. Was that face familiar? The ill-fated play where he'd been killed. Oh _no._ Saint George. The saint had stolen his body.\n\nEven if he'd had the strength to hammer on the door and tug at the handle, it'd have done him no good. With statues it's strictly first come, first stored. He'd been gazumped, at the last minute.\n\nHe had no more strength left to hang on. He let go.\n\n'Mike? You in there yet?'\n\nThe statue's eyes flickered.\n\n'Mike!'\n\nWith an effortless smoothness that did her no end of credit, the eyelids lifted.\n\n'Mike?'\n\n_That's not him in there!_ Odd, how you just know, simply by looking people in the eye. Just a coloured circle on a white background, a fried egg with a jewelled yolk. Perhaps we can actually see the retina, the way they do for ultrahigh-security identification routines, but too fast for our conscious minds to know what we've actually done.\n\n'Who?'\n\n_I know who! I'd recognise those beady, shifty little eyes anywhere_!\n\nBianca had quick reactions. Very few scientific instruments known to Man would be precise enough to measure the tiny instant it took her to grab the two-pound lump hammer and swing it at the head of her newly completed masterpiece. Compared to Saint George, though, she was a dinosaur in slow motion. Before her fingers had contacted the hickory handle, he was moving. As the hammerhead rushed towards him, he stuck out his newly acquired right arm, punched Bianca neatly in the eye, ducked the hammer blow and ran for it. Behind him, he heard a crash, suggesting that Bianca had sat down uncomfortably on the floor. He made a mental note to laugh triumphantly later, when he had the time.\n\nHe was through the door and out into the street faster than a jack-rabbit absconding with the Christmas club money.\n\nPainfully, feeling like a Keystone Kop five seconds after the director's yelled 'Cut!' Bianca hauled herself up off the floor and swore.\n\nGeorge, that bastard of a saint, had stolen another of her statues. Worse, he'd probably just killed her friend. Nice touch, that; poor old Mike had just had the rare privilege of being killed by both Good and Evil consecutively. Not that she had a clue any more which was which; nor did she care. If Mike still existed, anywhere in the cosmos, she guessed he was feeling the same way.\n\nThe hammer was still in her hand and she realised; Jesus, I just tried to _kill_ him. A saint. My own statue. I tried to kill one of my own statues, just when it was on the point of coming to life.\n\nIt wasn't being the sort of day you look back on with pride.\n**CHAPTER THIRTEEN**\n\n**'W** hat the Shopfloor,' Chardonay quavered, 'was _that?'_\n\nSlitgrind levered himself up out of a puddle with his forearms. His eyes were blind with saint-ash and his lungs were full of holy smoke. 'Guess,' he grunted, and then started to cough.\n\n'The dragon again?'\n\nBefore Chardonay could say anything else, Snorkfrod was at his side, hauling him up like an adored sack of spuds. Was he all right? Any bones broken? Did it hurt if she prodded him there?\n\n'Yes,' he yelped. 'Not that that means anything. That'd hurt under any circumstances.'\n\n'That dragon,' muttered Prodsnap, 'doesn't like us very much. What did we _do?'_\n\n'We tried to kill him,' Holdall replied. 'First we wee'd all over him, then we blew him up with dynamite. Maybe he's paranoid or something.'\n\nHaving dislodged the proffered paramedical assistance, Chardonay sat down on a low wall and put on the one boot he'd been able to find. 'Well,' he said, 'one thing's for certain, that dragon isn't dead. Not as such. Where's George?'\n\nThe other demons looked at each other.\n\n'Look,' Prodsnap said, 'let's put it this way. He's gone to a better place, and I don't mean Solihull.' He sneezed. 'I suggest we do the same. In our case, of course, we want to go to a worse place, but the principle's the same.'\n\n'Where's that damn priest got to, come to that?' Slitgrind growled. 'I'm trying to remember if he was with us in the van. Who saw the bugger last?'\n\nChardonay was staring at the abandoned van. Its engine was still running. 'That dragon,' he said, in a strange flat voice, 'just killed a saint.'\n\nSlitgrind shrugged a few shoulders. 'Plenty more where he came from. Look, can we get the Shopfloor out of here, before the sucker comes back?'\n\n'The dragon,' Chardonay repeated, 'just killed Saint George. That's _wrong.'_\n\nThe exasperated sound came from Slitgrind. 'Look, love,' he stage-whispered to Snorkfrod, who was putting powder (powdered what, you don't want to know) on her face, using a puddle for a mirror. 'Can you explain to that thick prat of a boyfriend of yours, any minute now that flying bastard's gonna come back and fry _us._ We gotta _go,_ for Chrissakes.'\n\n'All right, then,' Snorkfrod replied, 'you go.'\n\n'Huh?' Slitgrind's face was a study in bewilderment. Imagine what God would look like if he opened his post one morning and found he'd got a tax rebate. As bewildered as that.\n\n'Go. Bugger off. Sling your hook. We'll see you back at the factory.'\n\n'But...' Slitgrind's expression added terror to its repertoire. 'But we've got to stick together,' he whimpered. 'We can't go wandering about on our own, it's not _safe.'_\n\nSnorkfrod gave him a stare you could have broken up and put in whisky. 'Slitgrind, you nerk,' she said, 'you're a demon from sodding Hell. You're twenty million years old. I think it's probably time you learned to cross the road on your own.'\n\n'We aren't splitting up.' Chardonay had spoken with - well, virtually with authority. Not a large-scale authority - something like the English Tourist Board - but enough to get him his colleagues' attention. 'We've got work to do. Come on.'\n\nHe stood up, knees wobbly and calflike, head erect, and started to walk towards the van. The others had to trot to catch up with him.\n\n'Where're we going, Chiet?' Prodsnap asked, puffing.\n\n_Chief,_ noted Chardonay's subconscious. 'To find the dragon,' he replied. 'And kill it.'\n\nThree demons stopped dead in their tracks. A fourth used the delay to catch up - it's always hard to run in high heels, even when they're an integral part of your foot.\n\n'Are you crazy?'\n\n'No,' Chardonay replied. 'I'm bruised, lost and very frightened. But it's our duty. We're peace officers, with a responsibility to maintain the Divine Order. That dragon has just killed Saint George, it's against all the rules. It's got to be sorted out. And,' he went on, swallowing, 'since it's us here on the spot, we've got to do it. Is that clear?'\n\n'Stone me,' Prodsnap muttered. 'He's serious.'\n\n'I'm with you all the way,' sighed Snorkfrod, passionately. 'And I want you to know, I think that's the most moving thing I've ever heard.'\n\n'Thank you,' Chardonay replied. 'That means a great deal to me. How about the rest of you lads?'\n\nProdsnap, Slitgrind and Holdall exchanged glances.\n\n'We're right behind you, Chief.'\n\n'Count me in.'\n\n'You can depend on us.'\n\nFor a moment, Chardonay was lost for words. He glowed and seemed to grow an extra inch or two. 'Thanks, guys,' he said softly. 'Right, here goes.'\n\nHe punched his left palm with right fist, turned and headed off towards the van, Snorkfrod's arm through his. The other three fell in behind them.\n\n'Men.' Chardonay settled himself in the driver's seat, put on his seat-belt and took off the handbrake. 'I just want you to know, whatever happens from hereon in ...'\n\nWords failed him, not because of any sudden access of emotion, but because at that moment the back-seat passengers clobbered him and Snorkfrod silly with the tyre iron.\n\n_Not even for old times' sake_?\n\nThe dragon shook his head. 'No way, Nosher,' he replied. 'Look, I really am grateful to you, saving my life and all that, but I've had enough. I've done what I came to do and now I'm off.'\n\n_Just ten minutes of your time to vaporise a few trifling demons, Fred. For a pal._\n\n'No. Think about it, Nosher. I've got my whole life in front of me. I can go where I like, do what I want. Last thing I need is Hell putting a price on my head for snuffing five of their people. I'm more conspicuous than Salman Rush-die, Nosher. Longer. Harder to conceal. It'd be a confounded nuisance and I can do without it.'\n\n_I can take care of that. I can give you a whole new identity._\n\nThe dragon laughed. 'Sure you can, Nosh,' he replied. 'I mean, twentieth-century Earth is positively teeming with dragons, I'd have no trouble whatsoever blending in with the crowd. Get real, pal. I'm out of here.'\n\n_Fred._ The letters on the screen grew dim, flickery, as if to suggest deep and sincere regret. _If you walk out on me - well, around your neck be it._\n\nThe dragon froze. 'You bastard.'\n\n_Blown to smithereens, Fred, whatever a smithereen is. Walk out on me and I'll find out. Shame you won't be there to share the knowledge with me._\n\nChubby, who'd been silent, nodded sagely. 'Besides,' he added, 'how'd they know it was you? I've been making enquiries. As far as Hell Central's concerned, those five idiots are with a coachload of other idiots over in Nashville, Tennessee. Nobody knows they're here. When they don't come back, I expect Hell will assume they've defected to the other side, something like that.'\n\n'Defect?'\n\n_Actually, I think Chubby's a bit out of touch with recent developments. He's still got a Cold War mentality, which is thoroughly out of date these days. Let's say desert, shall we, rather than defect? They'd buy that, I'm sure._\n\nThe dragon growled ominously. 'You're bastards, both of you,' he said. 'All you care about is your stinking profits.'\n\nChubby clicked his tongue. 'Why is it,' he demanded, 'that people are always so rude about profits?'\n\n_Never honoured in their own country._\n\n'Free enterprise,' Chubby went on, 'is the life blood of commerce.'\n\n'Maybe,' the dragon snarled. 'But I'd rather not have their free enterprise on my paws, if it's all the same to you.'\n\n_I've just accessed my database and it says a smithereen is a small fragment or particle, usually the result of a catastrophic explosion. I assume it knows what it's talking about, but there's only one way to be absolutely certain._\n\n'You'd do it, wouldn't you?'\n\n_With infinite regret but negligible hesitation, yes._\n\nThe dragon sighed. His eyes, as he glowered at the screen, were case-hardened with contempt. 'You know something, Nosher?' he said. 'You're evil.'\n\n_You reckon? Sending you out to do battle with the forces of darkness and you say I'm evil?_\n\n'I do.'\n\nThe screen flickered, by way of a dry chuckle.\n\n_Evil schmevil, old pal. Go out there and fry some fiends._\n\nWith an effort, Mike stopped screaming and pulled himself together.\n\nIt took some doing. Sixty per cent of him was slowly drifting away through space. Forty per cent of him was slipping unobtrusively into the future. It was like trying to impose your will on seven over-excited Highland terriers.\n\nHeel, Mike commanded. And toe. And leg. And arm. Oh Christ, and head too.\n\nYou know the bit in all the films where they've just found the suitcase full of the money from the big heist; and suddenly the wind gets up and the air is full of flying banknotes; and first they all caper frantically around trying to catch them; and then they realise it's hopeless and collapse laughing to the ground while the credits roll all round them? Well, it was rather like that, hold the laughter. All Mike could manage (particularly since his face was now thirty yards and four hours away from the majority of him) was a wry grin.\n\nThe hell with it. Why bother? He was just about to relax and finally let go when ...\n\n_Oh my god, a statue! Where the hell did that come from ?_\n\nLook gift horses in the mouth if you must, but when confronted with a wholly unlooked-for, vacant, unlocked, fully furnished statue just when you're on the point of dissolving into space and time, you look for the little hatch between the shoulder-blades, you grab as much of you as you can reach, and you jump.\n\n'And this,' said the Council spokesman, 'is where the fountain was to have gone, and here's where we would have put the floral clock, and here's where we'd planned to have the big brass plaque recording the munificent generosity of Kawaguchiya Integrated Circuits (UK) plc.' He paused and drew breath. 'And here ...'\n\nFive pairs of impassive Japanese eyes followed his pointing finger and fixed on another part of the bomb crater.\n\n'Here,' continued the spokesman, 'we intended to have the centrepiece of Kawaguchiya Integrated Circuits Plaza, the staggeringly impressive statue of Saint George and the Dragon, by possibly the world's most talented living sculptress, Bianca Wilson.' Time for another breath; a deep one. 'Instead...'\n\nHe stopped. He blinked, rubbed his eyes. It was still there. 'Excuse me,' he said.\n\nHe touched it; solid. As a rock, you might say. Just to be sure, he kicked it, hard. _Ouch!_\n\n'Instead,' he went on, 'we have no dragon, but now we do seem to have got St George back. About three seconds ago, to be precise. Don't ask me how we did it, but we did it.' He sat down and removed his shoe. 'Clever old us, eh?'\n\nIf the KIC people had noticed anything odd, they didn't let it show. Two of the younger ones whispered to the grey-haired type who seemed to be the delegation leader. He nodded and whispered something back.\n\n'Very big statue,' he said.\n\n'It is, yes,' the spokesman agreed. 'And, um, solid. Made of solid stone, all the way through. Yessiree, this baby's here to stay.'\n\n_(Because, at the moment when George entered the newly completed statue of Mike, he broke the morphological link with his own former statue. No longer caught up in George's anomalous timestream, it went back to where it had come from; once again, just a statue, lifeless and inert.)_\n\nThe Council spokesman pulled his shoe back on, stood up and assumed a didactic pose. 'You will observe,' he said, 'the remarkable use of line which Ms Wilson has managed to achieve; the dynamic tension implicit in the composition of this masterpiece; the impression she conveys of desperate, headlong motion frozen for all time in the ...'\n\nSlowly, as if it had the cramp in its left leg, the statue got up, winced, swore and hobbled away down Colmore Row.\n\nYes, Bianca said, she'd accept the charges. 'Mike, where the hell...?'\n\n'In a call-box just off Pinfold Street,' Mike replied. 'Can you come and pick me up? Only ...'\n\n'Well?'\n\nMike glanced over his shoulder. Because it was only an ordinary-sized call-box, he was on his knees with his nose pressed right up against the glass. People outside were staring.\n\n'Just hurry, will you? And bring a lorry.'\n\nHe put the receiver down, breathed out hard. Someone was hammering on the door. Edging round carefully, he opened it and scowled.\n\n'What's the matter, you daft bitch?' he growled. 'You never seen a statue before?'\n\nBy coincidence, at precisely that moment another lorryload of statuary chugged round junction four of the M42, taking the exit signposted to Birmingham. In the back were eight Berninis, three Donatellos, three Cellinis, a Canova and the Giambologna _Mercury._ Michaelangelo's _David_ sat next to a harassed-looking man in a black jump-suit in the cab.\n\n'Sorry,' David admitted. 'I've never been much good at map-reading. Well,' he amended, 'this is actually my first attempt, but if I'd ever tried it before, I don't suppose I'd have made much of a fist of it then, either.'\n\nKurt muttered something under his breath. 'We're on the right road now, huh?'\n\n'I think so. We want to go to the big sprawly grey blob, looks like a squashed spider, name of Birmingham, right?'\n\nKurt swore and hauled on the wheel. 'Okay,' he said, 'I've turned right. Now what?'\n\nDavid bit his lip. 'Sorry,' he said, 'I meant right as in okay, not right the opposite of left. I think actually we wanted to go straight on.'\n\n'Oh, for Christ's sake!' Kurt had strong views on the subject of suffering fools gladly. It made him glad if fools suffered a _lot._ 'Now we've gotta go miles out of our way. Concentrate, dammit.'\n\n'Sorry.'\n\nThey drove on in silence for a while; Kurt sulking, David feeling guilty. When they were safely back on the right road, however, David turned to Kurt and said, 'Excuse me.'\n\n'Well?'\n\nDifficult to find a tactful way of putting this. 'What are we, like, doing here exactly?' David asked.\n\n'The job,' Kurt replied. 'You realise they drive on the wrong side of the road in this faggot-ridden country?'\n\n'What job?'\n\n_'The_ job. Deliver the statues, snuff the dragon, and then we're outta here. Not the weirdest thing I ever got hired to do,' Kurt added. 'In the top twenty, maybe even the top ten, but not in at number one. Still, it ain't exactly difficult. And it sure beats what I was doing before.'\n\n'Which was?'\n\n'Being dead.'\n\n'Ah. Right.'\n\nKurt frowned, detecting a certain lack of awe in his companion. After all, not many people come back from the dead. Even fewer come back from the dead and walk straight into a plum job in their chosen profession, as though they'd never been away. Jesus Christ and maybe Sherlock Holmes—Kurt, who'd been around and heard a thing or two, knew all that stuff about surviving the Reichenbach Falls was just a tax dodge - but that was it.\n\n'You ever been dead, son?' he queried:\n\n'Not to the best of my knowledge.'\n\n'Give it a miss,' Kurt advised. 'Don't get you anywhere.'\n\n'Who're we working for, then?'\n\nKurt's spasm of impatience nearly caused an accident. 'You don't ask questions like that in this man's business, boy. You can come to harm asking questions like that.'\n\nTrue, David reflected, we nearly did. We only missed that car by an inch or so. 'Sorry,' he said. 'But I'm really curious.' He paused; a thought had struck him. 'You do know, don't you?'\n\nKurt avoided his eye. 'Of course I frigging well know,' he snapped.\n\n'And?'\n\n'Read the damn map.'\n\nThey drove on in silence, if you could call it that, because Kurt was convinced that the sound of cogs turning in his brain was probably audible in Connecticut.\n\nIt had been a good question.\n\nJust who _was_ he working for?\n\nGeorge stopped running, ducked down behind a dustbin and froze.\n\nDebits and credits time. On the negative side, he was lost, confused, penniless, naked, in an unfamiliar and distinctly economy-class body and on the run from a livid sculptress and a fire-breathing dragon. On the positive side, he was alive. He closed his eyes and allowed himself to relax. On balance, he was further up the ladders than down the snakes, by something in the order of a thousand per cent.\n\nAbout four minutes later, he solved the clothing and money problem by jumping out on an unsuspecting passerby, knocking him silly with a broken bicycle pump he'd found in the dustbin and helping himself to his victim's personal effects. Fortunately, he and his unwitting benefactor were more or less the same size, although personally George wouldn't have chosen a lilac shirt to go with a navy blue jacket. But there; muggers can't be choosers. The shoes hurt his feet, but not nearly as much as the pavement would have done.\n\nAn appropriate moment, he told himself as he sauntered down the alleyway into New Street, to draw up an agenda. It went as follows:\n\n1. Find and scrag that bastard dragon.\n\n2. Easier soliloquised than done, of course. He still wasn't a hundred per cent at home in this century and maybe he was missing a trick somewhere, but he had arrived at the conclusion that the old Wormex™-in-the-water-supply tactic was going to be out of place here; although, to judge by the stuff he'd had in his whisky, a stiff dose of dragon powder could only improve the taste.\n\nThe basic principle, however, was surely a good one: get the dragon to drink something that'd disagree with him. The recipe ought not to be a problem. The ancient proverb stuck in his mind: you can lead a dragon to water, but you can't make him drink. How did you go about conning a dragon into slaking its thirst from your specially prepared homebrew; leave a big bowl with DRAGON on the side lying about in a public place? Unlikely to work.\n\nHold that thought. Since he was now wearing a whole new body, the dragon wouldn't know who he was. All he had to do, given the element of disguise, was walk up to the dragon in a bar and offer to buy him a drink.\n\nThe ugly snout of practicality intruded into his plans. As far as he could tell, this was a liberal century, uninhibited, where anything went (so long as you weren't fussy about it coming back again afterwards), but even so, you'd probably be pushing your luck sidling up to strangers in bars asking if they were a dragon and wanted a drink. On the right lines, he decided, but could do with a little bit more fine tuning.\n\nStill, at least he had a plan now, which was something. Next step, food. It had been a long time since breakfast and the body that had eaten the breakfast was now cinders and ashes. He pulled out his victim's wallet and opened it up; a nice thick wad of notes reassured him. Grinning, he crossed New Street, heading for the big McDonald's.\n\n'Wotcher, Mike.' A hand clumped down between his shoulder-blades, momentarily depriving him of breath. Before his instincts - well, they weren't his instincts of course - had time to send the kill message down to his arms, he cancelled the instruction. Whoever this body was, it had friends. And dragon hunters need friends, the way fishermen need maggots.\n\n'Hello yourself,' he replied, and turned to face whoever it was. 'How's things?'\n\n'Not so bad.' His friend, a tall, gangling bloke with round bottle-end glasses, was giving him a funny look. 'Heard you were, um, dead,' he said. 'Like, blown up or something.'\n\n'Not as such,' George replied. 'What you probably heard was that I was slowly dying of hunger and thirst, which is true. Of course, you can help me do something about that.'\n\nThe stranger laughed. What had he called him? Mike? Good old Mike, always cracking jokes.\n\n'Good idea,' the stranger went on. 'We could have a couple of pints, then maybe go for a Balti. Suit you?'\n\n'Sure.' Mike's friend started to walk, presumably knew where he was going. George fell into step beside him.\n\n'Haven't seen you about for a while now,' said Mike's friend.\n\n'You know how it is.'\n\n'So what's it like, working with the great Bianca Wilson?'\n\nGeorge put two and two together, and got a mental picture of a fast-swinging lump hammer narrowly shaving his ear. 'Eventful,' he said. 'Quite an education, in fact.'\n\n'I'll bet.'\n\nIn front of them, a pub doorway. Oh good, we seem to be going in here. I could just do with a—\n\nHe stopped dead. Ah _shit_!\n\nSitting at the bar, staring at him, were Bianca and—'Christ, Bianca, there's my body. Hey, grab him, someone. That's the bastard who stole my body!'\n\nIt's mortifying enough to be loudly accused of theft in a public place. To be accused by _yourself ..._ George, as always in such circumstances, gave serious thought to running away, but his erstwhile friend was standing between him and the door, giving him ever such a funny look.\n\n'You bastard!' Bianca was yelling at him too. 'Don't just stand there, Peter, grab the swine!'\n\nWho the hell was Peter? Oh, him. The treacherous bugger who'd brought him here. Stronger than he looks, our Peter. George's arm was now twisted up behind his back and there was very little he could do about it. Behind the bar, an unsympathetic-looking girl was muttering something about ringing the police.\n\n'Let go of me,' he grunted. 'I'm a saint.'\n\nPeter tightened his grip. 'You're a _what?'_\n\n'A saint. You deaf or something?'\n\n'That's right,' said Bianca, grimly, 'he is. If he tries to make a run for it, break his sodding arm.'\n\n'Hang on,' Peter was saying. 'If he really is a saint—'\n\n'That does it,' said the barmaid. She picked up the phone and started pressing buttons.\n\nGeorge struggled, painfully. 'You realise this is blasphemy,' he gasped - breath is at a premium when you're being half-nelsoned over a bar. 'You'll fry in Hell for this!'\n\n'You _bastard!'_ His body - Saint George's body - had a hand round his, Mike's, windpipe. 'Give me back my body _now,_ or I'll bloody well throttle you. It.' The significance of his own words struck him and he relaxed his hold slightly. 'Here, Bee, is there any way of getting him out of it?'\n\n'We could try death,' Bianca replied icily. 'Seems to work okay.'\n\nThe other occupants of the pub, though interested, seemed to regard saint-bashing as primarily a spectator sport. Wagers were being exchanged, theories aired. The barmaid had got through to the police and was giving what George felt was a rather one-sided account of the proceedings. It was time, he reflected, for a brilliant idea.\n\nAvailable options; not an inspiring selection. Be mutilated by Peter, strangled by - who _was_ that guy? Mike, presumably, whoever the hell he was, surgically dissected by the snotty sculptress or arrested by the cops. None of them, George admitted, felt intuitively right.\n\n'Help,' he croaked.\n\nThe prayers of saints seldom go unheard. Just as Mike was saying that maybe Bianca's suggestion had something going for it, and the distant sirens were coming closer, there was a refreshing sound of splintering glass, the thump of an unconscious body hitting the deck and a familiar voice at his side.\n\nFather Kelly. And about bloody time, too.\n\n'Of course he's a friggin' saint,' the priest was yelling. 'Can't ye see his friggin' halo, ye dumb bastards?'\n\n'Keep out of this, vicar,' Mike said angrily. Fortunately, Father Kelly took no notice, or perhaps he was just enraged at being confused with an Anglican. More broken glass noises, Father Kelly proving he knew the uses of empty Guinness bottles. He'd apparently used one on Peter, because George could now move his arms. He straightened up, to see Bianca swinging a bar stool at him. Fortunately, he had just enough time to thrust Father Kelly into the path of the blow—loud thunk, priest drops like stone, never mind. Leaving Bianca holding a broken stool and looking bemused, he jumped nimbly over the dormant Peter, shoved open the door, kicked an advancing copper squarely in the nuts and legged it.\n\nGod, he couldn't help thinking, looks after his own.\n**CHAPTER FOURTEEN**\n\n**'I** t's not on the map,' Slitgrind protested.\n\nThe van stood on the hard shoulder of the M6. In the front, Prodsnap and Slitgrind were poring over the vintage road atlas they'd found in the glove compartment.\n\n'There it is, look,' said Prodsnap, pointing.\n\n'No, you fool, that's Hull.'\n\n'Maybe that's just lousy spelling.'\n\nSlitgrind closed the atlas with a snap. 'Stands to reason,' he said. 'They don't put it on mortal maps, 'cos otherwise we'd have hundreds of bloody tourists blocking up the front drive all the time.'\n\nIt occurred to Prodsnap that maybe his colleague was being a trifle alarmist, but he didn't say anything. It was true, Hell wasn't on the map. He tried hard to remember the route the coach-driver had taken, but it had all been homogeneous motorway, with no landmarks whatsoever.\n\n'We'll have to ask someone, then,' he said:\n\nSlitgrind scowled. 'Don't be thick,' he replied.\n\n'Someone who knows, obviously,' Prodsnap said. 'Shouldn't be too hard.'\n\n'But ...' Slitgrind was about to protest, but the penny dropped. 'Do we have to?' he objected. 'Those people always give me the shivers.'\n\n'Me too.' Prodsnap suited the action to the word. 'But they'll know the way and we don't. Looks like we don't have much choice.'\n\nHis colleague grimaced, acknowledging the logic. 'Well,' he sighed, 's'pose they're on our side. In a way.'\n\n'Better the colleague you know, huh?'\n\nSlitgrind shrugged and turned the ignition key.\n\n'Give me the deep blue sea any time,' he muttered, and indicated right.\n\n_'I conjure you by Asmoday and Beelzebub, Sytray and Satan, eloi, elohim and Miss Frobisher, do please be careful, you nearly made me spill the Black Host_ ... '\n\nBarbed whips of wind flicked cruelly through the slighted walls of the ruins of Castle Roche. The moon had long since hidden her face behind the clouds and the only light was the livid orange glow from the foul-smelling fire. In the shattered keep of the castle, five white-clad figures, hooded and barefoot, huddled inside the arbitrary confines of a chalked ring. Around them lay the horrible impedimenta of the Black Rite: pantangles, tetragrammata, a sword, a mutilated Bible, a goat's skull, a frozen chicken, slowly defrosting ...\n\n'Are you lot going to be much longer?' demanded a querulous voice from outside the ring of firelight. 'It's _freezing.'_\n\nThe Great Goat sighed petulantly. 'These things can't be rushed, Miss - ah—'\n\n'Filkins,' hissed the Lesser Goat. 'Sonia Filkins. She's Mrs Brownlow's niece, from the Post Office.'\n\n'Can't I at least have a blanket or something?' whined Miss Filkins. 'I'm getting all goosepimply. And it's damp. Auntie Edie didn't say anything about sitting in the damp.'\n\nThe Lesser Goat simpered slightly. 'I'm sorry,' she whispered. 'But Brenda's babysitting up at the vicarage, and now Yvonne's started college ...'\n\n'I know,' sighed the Great Goat. 'Maybe next time, Miss Frobisher. I can't really see any point in continuing under these conditions.'\n\nMournful silence. The Lesser Goat started to pack away the horrible impedimenta.\n\n'If you've finished with the chicken,' said Miss Filkins, 'do you mind if I take it on with me? There's a really nice recipe in my magazine for chicken.'\n\n'Please,' grunted the Great Goat, carefully snuggling the skull in cotton wool. 'Help yourself. Such a pity to let good food go to—'\n\nHe fell silent. Although he was right next to the fire, his legs were suddenly icy cold. He didn't look round.\n\n'Miss Frobisher,' he croaked.\n\n'Yes, Dr Thwaites?'\n\n'Perhaps Miss, ah, Filkins needn't put her clothes back on quite yet.'\n\nThe Lesser Goat looked at him. 'But I thought—' _'Over there.'_ He jerked his head in the direction of the shattered tower. 'Um, by Asmoday and Beelzebub, Sytray and—'\n\n'Excuse me.'\n\nMiss Frobisher let out a little scream. The thurifer hastily stubbed out his cigarette. The sword-bearer, who was half in and half out of his vestments, made a grab for his trousers. Old Mr Blakiston, the Black Verger, dozed peacefully on.\n\n'Excuse me,' repeated Prodsnap. He was carrying an electric torch and wearing an old Barbour jacket he'd found on a scarecrow, for the night was cold; but the firelight dazzled vividly on his hooves and horns. 'We haven't missed it, have we, only we got a bit held up. Roadworks on the A34 just south of Chipping Norton.'\n\n_'Please_ can I put my clothes on now, Miss Frobisher? I'm going _blue.'_\n\nThe Great Goat winced. 'Please be _quiet,_ Miss Filkins,' he snapped. 'Um, would you, ah, care to join us? Quick, Miss Frobisher, the chicken!'\n\n'You said I could have it!'\n\nProdsnap shivered, despite his Barbour. 'Please,' he said, 'don't go to any trouble on our account. We had something at a Little Chef on the way. We really only wanted to ask—'\n\n'Bludy ew,' squeaked the thurifer. 'Issa bleedin' _deviw!'_\n\nThe Great Goat closed his eyes, mortified. First thing in the morning there'd be a vacancy for the post of Black Thurifer, and never mind the fact that Barney Philpot was the only twenty-four-hour plumber in the district. 'Thurifer,' he commanded, 'be quiet. By Asmoday and ...'\n\nSlitgrind nudged his colleague in the small of the back. 'For Chrissakes, Prozza,' he hissed, 'let's get out of here. I'm _scared._ Ow! That was my shin, you clumsy—'\n\n'We were wondering,' Prodsnap went on, raising his voice slightly, 'if you could help us out. You see, we're lost, and—'\n\n'Lost?' The Great Goat peered at him through thick-lensed bifocals. 'You mean, you fell with Lucifer, Son of the Morning, wantonly preferring the path of damnation to the—'\n\n'Missed the bus,' said Slitgrind. 'Got left behind. I think they did it on purpose,' he added resentfully. 'Someone's going to cop it when I get home.'\n\nThe Great Goat's mouth was hanging open, like a broken gate. 'Bus,' he repeated.\n\n'Outing,' said Prodsnap. 'To Nashville. And now we're having to make our own way home, and it's not actually shown on the map, so we were wondering if—'\n\n'Hey.' The Great Goat felt a tug on his sleeve. 'These two,' the sword-bearer was muttering. 'They for real?'\n\n'Of course they are, you foolish man!' hissed the Great Goat. 'Look at the horns! The tails!'\n\nThe sword-bearer shrugged. 'All right,' he said. 'Not what I expected, though.'\n\n'Not what you ...!'\n\n'Bit of a disappointment, really.'\n\n'How _dare_ you! These are ...'\n\nHe hesitated. Unshakable his faith might be, but there was something about the way that one devil was trying to hide behind the other that did tend to sap the forbidden glamour. 'Do excuse me asking,' he said apologetically, 'but do you gentlemen have any form of identification? Only, you see—'\n\n'It's that Great Horwood lot,' muttered the sword-bearer, 'dressed up in a lot of fancy dress. Here, is that you, Jim Partridge? 'Cos if it is, you can forget having your car back by the weekend.'\n\nProdsnap blushed green. 'Sorry,' he said. 'We don't actually have cards or anything. Usually,' he added, with his remaining shreds of dignity, 'we don't feel the need.'\n\n'Prozza—'\n\n'Shuttup, Slitgrind. I'd have thought,' Prodsnap soldiered on, 'the horns and the hooves and all that, they do rather speak for themselves.'\n\n'Cardboard and spirit gum,' sneered the sword-bearer. 'Do us a favour, Jim. You've had your joke, now bugger off.'\n\n'Prozza,' Slitgrind hissed; Prodsnap noticed that he was grimly averting his eyes from something. 'There's a bint over there with _no bloody clothes on_!'\n\nMoments like these, Prodsnap reflected, made you realise that the Chardonays of this world do have their uses. Chardonay, of course, was nice and snug in the van, tied up and gagged, likewise the demon Snorkfrod. Now _she'd_ know how to handle a situation like this, no trouble at all.\n\n'Quiet!' he snapped, then turned to the Great Goat, who was peering disconcertingly at him over the rims of his glasses. 'Um.' He racked his brains. Something convincing; a display of black magic, perhaps, an anti-miracle. Trouble was, he didn't know any. Not much call for black magic when you're a clerk in the wages office.\n\nThe nasty, suspicious one was leering at him. He decided to improvise.\n\n'Maybe this'll convince you,' he said, and threw something on the fire. There was a whoosh of flame and a loud bang. The sword-bearer leapt out of his skin. Old Mr Blakiston woke up, mumbled something about coffee and went back to sleep again. It had worked.\n\n'What the Shopfloor was that?' hissed Slitgrind.\n\n'Cigarette lighter,' Prodsnap hissed back. 'Now then, my, er, good man,' he went on, trying to look demonic, 'if you could just, I mean, I command you to give us directions. Now,' he added, and snarled. He inhaled a whiff of Black Incense and sneezed.\n\nThe Great Goat bowed humbly, felt in his inside pocket and produced an envelope and a biro. 'Now, if you go back the way you came as far as the Bunch of Grapes ...'\n\nEventually, George stopped running.\n\nOnly when he was absolutely convinced nobody was following him, of course. One long life and one short (so far) but highly eventful one had taught him the value of running away as a solution to virtually all problems. The way he saw it, if you can run, why bother to hide anyway?\n\nAbsolutely no idea where he was. A road sign said Hockley Street, but even if it was telling the truth (George had, on a number of occasions, prolonged his first life by not taking local authorities' words for it - 'Sure, that dragon's dead; ain't that so, Mr Mayor?' and 'Yup, we fixed that bridge last October' were notable examples) it didn't actually get him very far. Chances were, Hockley Street was every bit as lost as he was.\n\nBut it did contain a pub and all that running had given George a thirst you could rub down paintwork with. With a sigh of satisfaction that would have convinced you he'd just created the world ahead of schedule and under budget, he leaned on the door of the public bar and flowed in ...\n\nMarvellous thing, the human brain. In its vast, multi-megabyte subconscious memory, it stores everything - _everything —_ seen, heard, glimpsed, semi-noticed, unconsciously observed. If the librarians of the brain could get stuff up from the stacks just a little bit quicker, we'd all be supermen, and the planet would probably have been a radioactive shell back in 1906.\n\nThe Dun Cow, Hockley Street. Been there before. Recently...\n\nAs he walked in, Bianca was just explaining to the police officer (not the one who was still curled up in a ball, moaning softly; a different one) that the man who she'd tried to maim with a stool was guilty of art theft, causing explosions, attempted murder and innumerable counts of genocide. She'd never seen the priest before in her life, she could think of no reason why he should want to clobber two of her friends with beer bottles, and she was really sorry about his teeth, honest to God just an accident, probably the tooth fairy was on the phone right now to leading merchant bankers trying to raise some venture capital to finance such a major shipment ...\n\nBeen there. Wrecked that. Got the summons.\n\nGeorge turned, smoothly and swiftly, but not swiftly enough. A hand settled on his shoulder like a speeded-up glacier. Someone enquired of him where he thought he was going, then sidestepped his vicious elbow jab, kicked his knees from under him and clocked him one with a Lowenbrau ashtray.\n\n'It's him!' Bianca shrieked, pointing. 'Let go my arm, I want to _kill_ him!'\n\nSo, apparently, did the witnesses Mike and Peter; and George, who majored in cheating at the University of Life, saw a tiny sliver of a chance. They rushed at him, heavy policemen dragging along behind them like slipped anchors. He accordingly dived towards them, taking the direction his captor least expected. Grabbing hands missed him on all sides. He vaulted onto a table; from the table to the bar top; skidded along the bar like a glass of whisky in a Western; braked sharply; kicked the barmaid neatly in the eye as she lunged for his ankles; hopped down and legged it through the kitchens. As it says in the director's cut of the Sermon on the Mount: Blessed are those that fight dirty, for they shall be one jump ahead.\n\n'Stop him!'\n\nThe cook, assuming that the fast-moving character who'd just burst into his kitchen was a fugitive from payment, upended a tray of chilli over his head, causing him to misnavigate and cannon into the dustbin. It was then just a matter of scooping up his feet, tucking them in after the rest of him, putting on the lid and sitting on it; job done. If cooks were generals, wars would last hours, not years.\n\n'He's in here!' the cook shouted. 'And he owes for twelve portions of chilli.'\n\nInside a dustbin, nose full of potato peelings and the nasty things people leave on their plates after they've finished eating, even someone as resourceful as George has to take an enforced rest. If he's wise, he'll put the time to good use, analysing his position, evaluating the merits of alternative strategies, trying at all costs not to breathe in.\n\nThey emptied the bin on the floor - the cook joined the arrest roster; obstructing the police, assault with a wet colander—and fished George out. A policeman knelt down, handcuffs at the ready.\n\n'Hey, sarge!' he screamed. 'The bloke's on fire!'\n\nIf you're not used to them, halos can look remarkably like burning petrol, worn externally. There was yelling, milling about, wrenching of fire extinguishers off walls. Some fool set off the fire alarm, adding deafening noise to the feast of sensory input. George wriggled and struck out. In close combat, a discarded Fairy bottle covered in pan scrapings can be as effective as an Ingrams gun.\n\n'Grab the bastard!' somebody yelled, but you might as well have shouted 'Fix the economy!' to a gaggle of politicians. All that happened was that the barmaid got knocked into the sink and one policeman scored a direct hit on another policeman with the first exuberant jet from the fire extinguisher. After that it was sheer Brownian motion, Gorbals-style.\n\nEmerging from the scrum, George scrabbled across the floor, hauled himself up by the dishwasher and headed for the door. Like Napoleon's at Waterloo, it was a sound strategy undermined by treacherous conditions. He stood on a second-hand fried egg, skated three yards and collided with Bianca, pushing her into the remains of the Black Forest gateau. As he looked about him, George saw he was surrounded.\n\nThe saw _never say die_ didn't mean much to George. He frequently said _Die,_ or more usually, _Die, you bastard!,_ generally when standing over a fallen opponent. The principle behind it, however, was a dominant influence on his life. Without looking down he trawled the worktop, snatched up the first thing that came to hand, levelled it at his attackers and snapped 'Freeze!' Three quarters of a second later, they realised he was threatening them with a cheese-grater, but three quarters of a second was all he needed. There was a window. He jumped.\n\nGlass was still landing all around him when he opened his eyes. Scrambling to his feet, he launched himself forwards, aware that the window frame was full of swearing policemen cutting their fingers. He had the feeling that if they caught up with him, there'd be major sacrilege committed. He ran.\n\nThe back yard wall of the pub was low enough to swarm over if you weren't fussy about trifles such as broken glass. George dropped down the other side, turned over his ankle, sprawled headlong and banged his head against a car door in the act of opening.\n\n'Get in!'\n\nGeorge lifted his head. 'Sorry?'\n\n'I said get in. Come on!'\n\nHe looked up to see a black Mercedes, back door ajar, on the rear seat a wry grin with a human being attached to its back. Close at hand, angry policemen had discovered the yard gate was locked.\n\n'Who're you?' George asked.\n\n'My name's Stevenson,' the grin replied. 'And you're George. Pull your finger out, old son.'\n\n'But—'\n\nChubby Stevenson reached inside his jacket, produced a .45 Colt (like it says in the Book: _blessed are the Peacemakers)_ and pointed it at George's head. 'Chop chop,' he said, 'there's a good lad.'\n\nGeorge realised that it would be discourteous to refuse and got in.\n\n'Have they gone?'\n\n'Yes, Dr Thwaites.'\n\n'Good.' Wearily, the Great Goat picked up the Black Chalice, shook out the last dregs of cold tea and put it back in its straw-filled shoebox. Nobody had said anything, but they all knew that the handsome silver goblet was about to resume its career as the Swerford Golf Club President's Cup. Having your nightmare come true is the final disillusionment.\n\n'Dr Thwaites.'\n\n'Mmm?'\n\n'About next Thursday' Miss Frobisher's voice was heavy with the embarrassment of betrayal; the same tone of voice Judas Iscariot used when telling the Chief Priest he'd rather have cash, if it was all the same to him. 'I've just remembered it's the Red Cross whist drive, so I won't be able to make it after all. I do hope—'\n\n'Not at all, Miss Frobisher, not at all.' The Great Goat sighed. 'As it happens, I think I'm busy that day, too. What about you, Barney?'\n\nThe thurifer was. about to explain that coincidentally, he'd probably be working late next Thursday, when all five of them became aware of a richer darkness, as some great shape interposed itself between them and the fleeting moon.\n\n'Go away!' snapped the Great Goat. 'Can't you see we're closed?'\n\nThey ducked. As non-verbal responses go, a fiery tsunami unleashed about three feet over one's head is remarkably eloquent.\n\n'Won't keep you a tick,' said the dragon.\n\n_About Good and Evil._\n\nKurt twitched impatiently. Moral philosophy had never interested him much, having as much relevance to his profession as a pipe-cleaner to the Mersey tunnel; if he'd wanted a lecture on ethics, however, his first choice wouldn't have been a word processor.\n\n'Hey,' he said, 'save it for the customers, will you? I delivered the goods, just pay me and I'll split.'\n\n_You also have a dragon to kill, don't forget._\n\nKurt made an exaggerated show of looking round. 'Nope,' he said at last, 'don't see any dragon in here, unless he's hiding in the drawer disguised as a pencil. Look, pal, you do your job and I'll do mine, okay?'\n\n_No. Look at me. This is relevant._\n\nWith a sigh, Kurt perched on the edge of the desk and folded his arms.\n\n'Shoot,' he said.\n\n_With pleasure. Good and Evil, then. Define Goodfor me._\n\n'Huh?' Kurt thought for a minute. 'Good what?'\n\n_Not good anything. Just Good._\n\nKurt's eyebrow lifted, Spock-like. 'Dunno,' he said. 'All depends on where you're at, I guess. Like,' he went on, 'it's a good shot if you fire it and hit me, but from where I'm standing there ain't much that's good about it.'\n\nThe screen filled with glowing green ticks. _Very good, Mr Lundqvist, you're way ahead of me. Nevertheless, I'll explain further._\n\n'Why?'\n\n_Indulge me. Good and Evil are, of course, two sides of the same coin. What's good for me is bad for you. One man's Mede is another man's Persian. The current of morality is more often alternating than direct. That, I imagine, is scarcely news as far as you're concerned. Am I right?_\n\n'More right than Franco, buster. What's this to do with—?'\n\n_Please don't interrupt. You've been hired to kill a dragon. Dragons are Evil, yes?_\n\n'Guess so.'\n\n_Saints, on the other hand, are Good. Agreed?_\n\n'Yeah.'\n\n_Wrong. It all depends on the individual concerned. And even then, it's still very much a question of subjective interpretation. Take Saint George, for example._\n\n'Huh?'\n\n_Saint George. Noted dragon-slayer. Come on, you must have heard of him. A legend in your profession, surely._\n\nKurt nodded. 'In his day,' he replied absently. 'Lotta blood flowed under the bridge since then.'\n\n_Nevertheless. A killer, Kurt. Someone who destroyed other intelligent life forms for money._\n\n'A professional.'\n\n_A saint. And not just any old saint, but the patron saint of peaceful, law-abiding, animal-loving Albion. You know why that is_?\n\n'Never gave it any thought,' Kurt replied honestly.\n\n_Three thousand a year patronage allowance, that's why. And because no other saint of adequate seniority was prepared to be associated with a cluster of wet, foggy islands on the very north-western edge of the known world. Nobody could believe it when he volunteered. It was like asking to be made Secretary of State for Northern Ireland._\n\nKurt shrugged. 'So?'\n\n_So, with George as its patron, this poxy little cluster of islands built an empire, the biggest ever. Top nation for a time, this poxy little cluster; bigger than France or Italy or Germany, owned half of Africa, half of Asia. Remember Agincourt, Kurt? God for Harry, England and Saint George_?\n\n'I missed that game. I was working. Saw the highlights, but—'\n\n_Not bad for the last place God made, under the patronage of a hired killer. And God was an Englishman in those days. Results count for something, wouldn't you say?_\n\n'Do me a favour,' Kurt protested. 'All that time, the sucker was dead.'\n\n_Doesn't matter. When you're a saint, it's not what you_ do _that really matters, it's what you are. George was the dragon-slayer. He won the Big Fight. He inspired generations_ of _Englishmen to go out and beat the crap out of all foreigners. Name me a European country England hasn't beaten in a war. France? Twice. Germany? Twice. Italy, Spain, Russia, Norway, Austria ..._\n\n'Greece,' Kurt interrupted. 'Switzerland. Monaco...' He fell silent. 'Okay, point taken,' he continued, 'but so what? That don't prove nothing.'\n\n_Wrong. The good guys are always the winners, aren't they? I mean, the President doesn't get up on the rostrum at the Victory Parade and say to all the world, 'Okay, we admit it, we were in the wrong but fuck it, we won anyway.' Who's Good and who's Evil is decided by trial by combat; it's the only way. Or can you admit the possibility of a scenario where the good guys are all stomped on and the baddies are singing here-we-go, here-we-go, when the final credits are actually rolling? You can't, not without your brain getting squeezed out your ears._\n\n'Get to the point,' Kurt grunted awkwardly.\n\n_Simple. England prevailed because she was in the right, because George killed the dragon. How or why he did it doesn't matter a cold chip. Agreed_?\n\n'If I agree, will you pay me the money you owe me?'\n\n_But all that's changed now. England's finished. She's a suburb of Europe, the USA's poor relation, got about twenty-five per cent of the international stature of the Philippines. You could saw Europe off at Calais and it'd be a month before anybody noticed. So what happened_?\n\n'I have this dreary feeling you're gonna tell me.'\n\n_The result must have been wrong, Kurt. There's got to have been a foul-up. The wrong guy must have killed the dragon. And that's why there has to be a rematch._\n\n'Kurt shrugged. 'Okay,' he said. 'If I was the kind of weirdo who went along with that kinda crap, maybe I'd buy that too. But you want me to kill this goddamn dragon, so—'\n\n_After the fight, Kurt, after the fight. The dragon wastes George, you waste the dragon. The United States conclusively defeats the personification of Evil, and under the patronage of Saint Kurt proceeds to manifest its destiny. Everybody lives happily ever after._ The screen filled with little wavy lines; cybernetic laughter. _That's why I've just arranged for George to be rescued. Can't very well go fighting dragons if he's doing three years for assault and battery._\n\nKurt thought it over for a while.\n\n'Once I've killed the dragon,' he asked, 'do I get paid?'\n\n_Of course._\n\nKurt nodded. 'Okay,' he said. 'That's my definition of a happy ending.'\n\n_You heard all that_?\n\nChubby nodded to his laptop and smiled. 'You bet,' he said. 'I thought you handled that very, um, adequately.'\n\n_He'll do what he's told. After all, what else are people for?_\n\n'Indeed.'\n\n_Talking of which ..._\n\nChubby sighed. Whenever the blasted box of tricks went all parenthetical on him and started ending sentences with three dots, he knew he was in for something more than usually shitty. 'Hm?'\n\n_After he's dealt with the dragon, kill him._\n**CHAPTER FIFTEEN**\n\n**'W** ith respect.' Lin Kortright whitened his knuckles around the telephone, swivelled his chair, bit the end off a cigar and spat it into the ashtray. 'With respect,' he repeated, 'you guys are obviously experts in the recycled Time business, but you don't know the fight game from _nothing._ Otherwise ...'\n\nTraditionally, sudden explosions of devastating elemental power have to be heralded by fair warning. Civil wars and the deaths of princes, therefore, are announced by comets and portents. Cyclones and tempests are preceded by gathering clouds and torrential rain. And Lin Kortright says, 'With respect.'\n\nAnd then something extremely peculiar happened.\n\nMr Kortright _listened._\n\nWhich is a bit like opening your daily paper and seeing that because of hitherto undetected design faults God has just issued a recall notice on the human race. You don't expect it. Large chunks of the fabric of reality start to come away from the joists.\n\n'Yeah,' he said, eventually. 'Yeah, you're right, we could do that. Say, that's a pretty neat idea. Only wish I'd thought of that myself.'\n\nNo sooner had the words left his mouth than six lifeboatloads of rats lowered themselves over the side of The Universe As We Know It and started to row like buggery. For Lin Kortright to say, 'You're right' in a room containing no mirror was utterly, absolutely...\n\n'Brilliant,' he added. 'Hey, man, I'm beginning to wonder if you need me in on this at all. Seems to me you got it all sewn up already.'\n\nDistant thunder rumbled. Eagles towering in their pride of place beat a hasty retreat, while mousing owls exchanged evil glances, rubbed their talons together and said, 'Right, let's get the bastards.' The air crackled with static.\n\n'No, really,' Mr Kortright went on, 'in the circumstances I couldn't possibly accept ten per cent. The most I'd feel justified in taking would be five, and even then...'\n\nNormality flung a few things in a suitcase and emigrated.\n\nTo hype a big fight, you have to follow set procedures. First, you must find a few toothless old duffers for the contenders to massacre, by way of setting the scene. Then you book the chat-show appearances so that the Boys can glower at each other over the presenter's shoulder. Then you hire a hall and start printing tickets.\n\nIn this case, however, the rules were there to be broken. For a start, there could be no warm-up fights for fear of irreparable damage to the Earth's crust. No late-show appearances for the contestants; the whole point of finding George was to make sure he'd be safely out of the dragon's way until the bell went for the first round. As for the venue, that couldn't be rushed; it had to be the Gobi desert, or the whole fight was off. Above all, the fight couldn't be advertised in case the two contestants found out that a fight was being organised.\n\nNevertheless, it seemed unlikely they'd have any trouble getting rid of the tickets, seeing that on the same morning both Nostradamus and Mother Shipton called almost simultaneously to point out that they'd predicted the fight and booked seats four hundred years ago. That just left the venue; a bit like saying, _We've made the sandwiches and filled the thermos, that just leaves turning the water into wine, plenty of time to do that after we've been to the supermarket._\n\nCue Lin Kortright ...\n\nFurtively, guiltily, five shadowy figures crept along the wire perimeter fence, wirecutters in hand.\n\nThey were about to commit burglary. That's theft, and a sin.\n\nThey were about to burgle the nuclear power station at Sellafield. That's just plain _stupid._\n\nOne of the five demons was considerably more relaxed about the proceedings than his colleagues, it must be said. When Chardonay came round and Prodsnap explained to him that there'd been a mutiny and he was now talking to _Captain_ Prodsnap, his abiding reaction had been amazed, delighted joy. No more decisions. No more responsibility to the other members of the team. No more getting the blame for such mistakes on his part as the weather, the alignment of the moon with Mercury or the battle of Salamis.\n\nThe other four weren't so cheerful.\n\n'Quit snivelling,' Prodsnap muttered sharply. 'Nothing to be afraid of. Home from home. Only danger I can foresee is, you'll all like it so much you won't want to leave.'\n\nHis followers exchanged glances. The mood of the meeting was that if he'd just taken out a correspondence course in dynamic leadership techniques, he'd be justified in asking for his money back.\n\n'Run through it again,' Slitgrind said. 'Go on, one more time.'\n\n'I've explained five times already.'\n\n'I wasn't listening.'\n\nProdsnap sighed. 'Okay,' he said, 'listen up, people.' He'd heard the expression somewhere - the extremely nasty part of Hell reserved for Europeans who try to play American football, probably - and guessed it might be worth a try. Right now, _anything_ was worth trying. 'In order to get home we really need that uranium, right?'\n\n'We're fairly straight on that bit,' interrupted Chardonay mildly. 'I think it's the actual burglary where we're all still a bit at sea.'\n\n_Wish you were_ , thought Prodsnap savagely. 'What's so hard to understand?' he replied, demonstrating his contempt for the minor problems that confronted them with an airy gesture. 'We cut the wire, smash down the doors, go in, help ourselves. The pink bloody panther could cope with that. Now then, Slitgrind, you've got the wirecutters. Snorkfrod, you're doing the big hammer stuff. Holdall, you're the smallest, you climb in through the window of the main office and nick the keys. Chardonay, you go into the fusion chamber and lift the actual stuff...'\n\n'Wilco, boss.'\n\n'Chardonay, what the Shopfloor are you doing?'\n\n'Saluting, boss.'\n\n'Are you taking the ...?'\n\nChardonay sounded genuinely hurt. 'No, boss. I want you to know that whatever happens, I'll be in there giving it my best shot. Sir,' he added.\n\nProdsnap shuddered. 'After that, it's just a matter of running for it. If we get separated, we meet up back at the van. All right so far? Splendid. Slitgrind, the wire.'\n\nSnip. Snip. The alarm went off.\n\n'Oh.' Prodsnap's face fell like a drunken trapeze artiste. 'That's a pity. Um...'\n\n'Sir.'\n\n'Not now, please—'\n\n'Sir,' Chardonay insisted, 'I'd love to volunteer to locate and disable the alarm. I'd also be thrilled to bits if you'd let me stalk and neutralise the guards who may be hurrying to the scene. If that's all right with you.'\n\nProdsnap could feel one of his headaches coming on. 'Yeah, right,' he said. 'Whatever you...'\n\nBut Chardonay wasn't there any more. He'd already scaled the fence—it was electrified, but as far as a demon's concerned the difference between an electric fence and an inert one is the same as between thermal and standard underwear - and was inside the compound. Inside his own personal cloud, he caught a fleeting glimpse of silver.\n\n'Well,' he said, 'that seems to have got rid of him. Snorkfrod, you wouldn't mind just nipping after him, make sure he's okay? Right, see you later.'\n\nAs Snorkfrod's fishnetted leg vanished over the top of the fence, Prodsnap counted up to five and rubbed his claws together.\n\n'Looks like we've got shot of both of them,' he said perkily. 'Come on, lads, we've got work to do.'\n\nSlitgrind frowned. 'Where're we going?'\n\n'Round the front gate, of course. Come on, guys, let's move it.'\n\nThe main gates of the compound were manned by three large men and two Rottweilers. The dogs were no trouble - in Hell, they'd have been relegated to tartan-collar-and-knitted-jacket status. The guards would probably take some finessing.\n\n'Excuse me.'\n\nThe guard's neck swivelled. 'Halt!' he snapped. 'Who goes...?'\n\n'Excuse me,' repeated the voice from the darkness. 'I'm coming towards you. Don't do anything hasty, I just want a quick word.'\n\nProdsnap advanced, smiling. As he stood under the floodlights, the guard made a funny noise in the back of his throat and started to edge away.\n\n'Evening,' Prodsnap went on. 'You can see me all right, then?'\n\n'What the fuck...?'\n\nProdsnap nodded. 'I know,' he said. 'No oil painting, huh? Bit on the weird side, too.'\n\nJust sufficient motor function control remained in the guard's body to enable him to nod. Prodsnap extended a hand, but the guard didn't respond.\n\n'I'll ask you to imagine,' Prodsnap was saying, 'what you're going to tell your sergeant when you report this incident. Think about it.'\n\nThe guard was already thinking.\n\n'The way I see it,' Prodsnap said, 'I can picture you tapping on the office door. \"Well?\" says Sarge. \"Sarge,\" you say, \"the compound's overrun with horrible-looking devils.\"' Prodsnap paused for effect. 'Not much good for a bloke's career, is it, getting a reputation for seeing things? Now we both know you're not imagining this, but—'\n\n'Pass, friend.'\n\nThat, however, was about as far as Prodsnap's plan took him. Somehow he'd imagined that once he was inside the wire, finding the uranium would present no great problem. He didn't know what he expected - a glow? Fingerposts saying _This Way To The Nukes_ —but he'd expected something. What he found was a settlement, certainly no larger than Manchester.\n\n'Bugger,' he said.\n\nBecause the sirens were still yowling themselves silly, nobody much was about; there were a few harassed-looking types running around, jumping in and out of vehicles and shouting orders into walkie-talkies, others sedately walking, ticking things off on clipboards. Some men in overalls were creosoting windowframes. Four men in suits were eating sandwiches out of tupperware lunch-boxes. No uranium on display anywhere.\n\nOh well, only one way to find out. 'Excuse me.'\n\nA tall, thin girl, big shoulder-pads, wearing what was either a skirt or a belt (impossible to say which), turned her head, double-took and said, 'Eeek!' Prodsnap advanced a step, wisely decided against smiling, and instead said, 'Hi.'\n\n'Um. Hi.'\n\n'Wonder if you could help us,' Prodsnap went on. 'We're looking for the, um, core. Do you happen to know where...?'\n\nThe girl backed away, her eyes big as melons. 'The core,' she repeated.\n\n'That's right.' Prodsnap let his mind freewheel. 'We're the inspectors. You saw the notice, presumably?'\n\n'I don't think I ... Inspectors?'\n\nProdsnap nodded. 'You don't think we were born like this, do you?' he said, in a tone of voice that suggested that any further references to appearance would constitute gawping at the misfortunes of the disabled. Good ploy; a microsecond later, you could have sworn the girl hadn't noticed anything at all out of the ordinary in their appearance. 'Anyway,' Prodsnap went on, 'there was supposed to be someone here to meet us, but I think there may have been a bit of a mix-up...'\n\n'Actually,' the girl said, 'I only work in Accounts, I don't actually know here they keep the, er...'\n\nProdsnap shrugged. 'Never mind,' he said, 'thanks anyway. There isn't a map or anything, is there?'\n\nThe girl thought for a moment. 'Well,' she said, 'you could always try the Visitors' Centre, I suppose. You know, where they have all the tourist stuff. It's just over there, by the gift shop.'\n\nIt was Holdall's idea to steal a van. The first one that came to hand was a mobile canteen, with tea-urns, film-wrapped sandwiches, KitKats and packets of crisps. Slitgrind parked it outside the Visitors' Centre with the engine running while Prodsnap went in. He'd found an overcoat and a cloth cap in the back of the van; it was like putting an Elastoplast on a severed limb, but it was the best he could do.\n\n'Excuse me...'\n\n'Eeek!'\n\nSuddenly, Prodsnap felt very weary. His mind went blank. All he could think of was the direct approach. Only the one woman behind the desk. He cleared his throat.\n\n'Yes,' he said, 'you're right. I'm a fiend from Hell. Actually, my name's Prodsnap, and although I do live in Hell I'm really only a wages clerk, and right now I'm on holiday, off duty. Have you got a problem with any of that?'\n\n'N-no.' The woman seemed to be frozen rigid. Had she pressed a hidden buzzer or panic button? Well, only time would tell on that one. 'How can I h-help you?'\n\n'A map of the complex, please. Is there a guided tour, anything like that?'\n\nThe woman looked at him. Hadn't, she enquired, the company who organised his tour dealt with all that? She produced a roster. Which group did he say he was with, exactly?\n\nOh, the Shopfloor with it. 'Listen, love,' Prodsnap growled. 'The purpose of our visit isn't exclusively tourism.'\n\n'No?'\n\nProdsnap shook his head. 'Actually,' he said, 'it's theft. Tell me where the uranium is and everything'll be just—'\n\n' _EEEEK_!' More bloody alarms, sirens, the works. Paranoid, the lot of them. Just happen to mention you wanted to swipe their uranium and the whole place goes apeshit.\n\n'Thank you,' Prodsnap said, 'you've been most helpful.' He was about to run when an idea struck him. He slowed down, strolled nonchalantly outside and leaned up against the side of the van, trying to look like a hideous mutant Maurice Chevalier.\n\n'For Christ's sake,' Slitgrind hissed, 'what do you think you're doing? Can't you hear the ...?'\n\nProdsnap nodded. 'Any second now,' he replied, 'security' ll turn up. They're bound to know where the core is. We'll ask them.'\n\n'But—'\n\n'Who do you reckon's likely to be more scared? Us of them, or them of us?'\n\nSure enough, security arrived; about fifty of them, armed to the teeth and looking distinctly apprehensive. To counter all their weaponry, Prodsnap had a smile, which he'd been able to practise once or twice in the van's wing-mirror while he was waiting. He ambled up to the fiercest-looking bloke he could see, said 'May I?', took his gun and ate it.\n\n'My name's Prodsnap,' he said. He waved his talon. 'And this is Slitgrind, and this is Holdall. We're from Hell. Could you take us to where the uranium's stored, please? Sorry to bounce you like this, but we are in rather a hurry.'\n\n'Fire!'\n\nProdsnap closed his eyes. No point expecting to see edited highlights of his past life because there wasn't time. Idly he wondered whether what was about to happen to him would be death or just some kind of extremely rapid transdimensional lift.\n\nNothing happened. A thousandth of a second became a hundredth, a hundredth became a tenth. That's the bummer with long-distance travel, he reflected, all this standing about waiting.\n\nHe opened his eyes just as the gunfire started. About time too, he muttered to himself, then he realised that nobody was shooting at him.\n\nThey were shooting upwards, at the dragon.\n\nBy the time Mike and Bianca got out of the police station it was lunchtime. Since there was nothing else they could usefully do, they decided to go for a curry.\n\n'On balance,' Mike said over the pappadoms, 'I can't say I'm all that bothered. Never liked the old body much, after all. I'm not exactly crazy about this one, but a change is as good as a rest. Could be a whole lot worse, after all.'\n\nBianca nodded. 'Glad you see it that way,' she replied. 'Wish they'd hurry up, I'm starving.'\n\n'You can have the last pappadom, if you like.'\n\n'Thanks, I will.' She did. 'What with one thing and another,' she went on, 'I can't remember the last time I had a proper meal. Plays hell with your metabolism, all this meddling in the supernatural.'\n\nMike shrugged. 'I'm all right,' he replied. 'Saint George must have had something to eat quite recently. I know I only met him briefly, and under peculiar circumstances at that, but I can well believe he wouldn't be the sort to neglect his carbohydrates.'\n\n'Me too.' Bianca dipped the last fragment in the mango chutney. 'Does it feel odd?' she asked. Mike nodded.\n\n'A bit,' he replied. 'The arms are a bit short and the waistband's on the large side. Still, like my mum used to say when I was a kid, I expect I'll grow into it.'\n\n'Can't really say it suits you. Mind you, neither did the old one.'\n\n'That's me all over. Leading fashions, not following them. You'll see. In six months' time, everybody'll be trying to look like this.'\n\n'I knew a girl once who had her nose done. You know, cosmetic surgery. Had a crisis of identity about it, so she said. Mind you, if I'd forked out ten thousand quid to be made to look like a parrot, I'd probably be asking myself all sorts of difficult questions.'\n\nThe food arrived. 'Now there's a thought,' Mike suggested. 'If only we could suss out exactly how this bodies-and-statues thing worked, we could make an absolute fortune.'\n\n'The word We, in context...'\n\n'It'd be amazing,' Mike went on. 'You know; for a modest fee, you too can have the body of a young Greek god. The hell with nose jobs, we're talking total physical remodelling here. Have you any idea what the total revenue of the slimming industry amounts to in an average year?'\n\n'Mike—'\n\n'Not to mention the private health care aspect. Is your body clapped-out, leaking oil, slow to start in the mornings? Chuck it away and get a new one.'\n\n'Mike,' Bianca said, 'just what the hell are we going to do?'\n\n'About the dragon?' Mike replied. 'And Saint George and the fabric of reality as we thought we knew it? Who says we've got to do anything?'\n\n'I do.'\n\n'Bianca.' Mike did his best to look serious, although he wasn't entirely sure he knew how to do it in the new body; he hadn't yet worked out, as it were, which lever was the indicators and which was the windscreen wipers. 'I don't think it works like that. People like us aren't supposed to get involved in this kind of thing. Rescuing the planet's not down to us. Save three worlds and you _don't_ get a free radio alarm clock.'\n\n'Nevertheless.'\n\nMike tried a different tack. 'And besides,' he said, 'even if you were able to do anything about anything, how the hell do you know what's the right thing to do? I assume,' he added, 'you'd insist on being tediously conventional and doing the right thing.'\n\n'Naturally. Oh come on, Mike, use your common sense, it's obvious who's in the right and who's in the wrong.'\n\n'Is it?' Mike took advantage of the high level of dramatic tension to swipe some of Bianca's nan bread. 'Go on then.'\n\nBianca frowned. 'Well, the dragon, of course. Stands to reason.'\n\n'You reckon?'\n\n'Mike, that bastard stole your body. My statue. He tried to kill you.'\n\n'The other bugger succeeded in killing me. Or had you forgotten?'\n\n'But that was an accident!'\n\nIt was Mike's turn to frown. 'Sixteen people, Bianca, one of them me. All right, it wasn't deliberate, but I don't think the bastard actually cared very much.'\n\n'But George killed all the dragons,' Bianca protested. 'It was genocide. They were innocent people—'\n\n'Not people. Only humans are people. Innocent animals.'\n\n'Okay, okay. But they'd never done him any harm, and he killed them.'\n\n'Enjoying the lamb? My chicken's nice.'\n\n'That's _different_.'\n\nMike shrugged. 'If you say so. Look, I'm not saying George is the good guy, either. Of course he's not. All I'm saying is, it's not precisely simple and straightforward. Most particularly, it's not the sort of thing where you can make up your mind on the basis of which contestant's cuddlier and has the nicest eyes.' Mike paused, partly for effect, mostly because his food was going cold and he knew his priorities. 'Appearances count for fuck-all in this. Particularly,' he added, 'since you made all the appearances.'\n\nBianca thought about that for a moment. 'That's the point, though,' she said. 'Surely. I mean, if anybody _knows_ these guys, it must be me. It was me designed them. I made them what I wanted them to be. And I guess I always believed, deep down, that the dragon was somehow the good guy. I think I carved him that way.'\n\n'More fool you, then. You finished with the lentils? I'm hungrier than I thought.'\n\n'Mike,' Bianca said, 'I can't explain it, I just know.'\n\n'I used to say that in exams, but they wouldn't believe me. And I did know, too,' he added. 'Usually because I had the answers written on my shirt-cuff.'\n\n'Mike—'\n\n'Actually,' he went on, 'that's amazingly profound. You see, my answers were right but they didn't count because I made them wrong by cheating. The same goes,' he added, with his mouth full, 'for Life. And all that stuff.'\n\nBianca didn't say anything. She seemed to have lost her appetite, and Mike finished off her pilau rice. It's wicked, he explained, to waste good food.\n\n'All right,' she said eventually. 'So what do you think we should do?'\n\n'Have some coffee.'\n\n'OK. And then?'\n\n'I'll know after I've had my coffee.'\n\n'Mike...'\n\nHe leaned back in his chair. 'Bee,' he said. 'Shut up.'\n\nThe dragon swooped.\n\nHe could smell the uranium; a nasty, chemical smell that made his mouth taste. And he could smell demons.\n\nAnd then he could see them. They had humans all round them, which was a nuisance because he really didn't want to have to kill any more of them. It was the difference between stalking a man-eating lion in the long grass and running over a dazzled hedgehog.\n\nEggs and omelettes, he told himself. Omelettes and eggs.\n\nSomething like hail or sleet pinged off his scales and he realised that the humans were shooting at him. Bloody cheek. If they weren't careful, they could put his eye out. He opened his wings, climbed, banked and came in again; a steeper, faster approach, making himself a very difficult target indeed. He knew; he'd had the practice.\n\n'Snorkfrod,' pleaded Chardonay, 'you'll break him if you do that. _Please_ put him down.'\n\nThe she-devil scowled. 'He aimed a gun at you. I'm going to pull his—'\n\n'No you're not. I'm responsible for all breakages. What you've done to their fence is bad enough.'\n\n'All right.' The sentry fell two feet, hit the ground, squirmed like an overturned woodlouse and ran. 'I love it when you're masterful, Mr C,' the she-devil simpered. 'You remind me ever so much of Kevin Costner.' Chardonay didn't know who Kevin Costner was, but sincerely hoped he wasn't litigiously minded. 'Right,' he said. 'I think we'd better head back to the van, this clearly isn't going to—'\n\n'Mr C.'\n\n'I know.' Chardonay, who had flung himself face down on the ground, picked himself up and stared at the huge, fast-moving shape hurtling through the sky. 'It's him. That bastard...'\n\n'Do you want me to get him, Mr C?'\n\nThe expression on her face - eager, thrilled to bits at the chance of doing something to impress and please - was almost heartbreaking. She would, too, he realised, if only I said the word. And maybe she'd succeed. If she failed, it wouldn't be for want of extreme savagery. But he couldn't do it. The spirit was sufficiently psychotic, but the flesh was weak. She wouldn't stand a chance.\n\n'Don't be stupid. And get down before he sees you.'\n\n'Righty-ho, Mr C.'\n\n'Not on top of me, please. I can't breathe.'\n\n'Is this better?'\n\n'I can breathe, certainly. But would you mind just...?'\n\nThe slipstream from the dragon's passage hit them like a hammer, and for the first time Chardonay appreciated the extraordinary power and strength of the bloody thing. It was going to take a whole lot more than just the five of them to cope with it. In fact, it wouldn't be a foregone conclusion if the whole damn Department turned out against it. There was, quite simply, no way of telling how powerful the monster was, apart from picking a fight with it, of course. That's like saying there's one simple way of discovering what height you can drop a porcelain vase from before it breaks.\n\n'The Shopfloor with this,' Chardonay said. 'Let's get out of...'\n\nThe dragon swooped.\n\nThree of them, at least. The other two were bound to be around here somewhere. Besides, he reflected, I have this notion that if I go around letting off fireworks too close to this uranium stuff, pinpoint accuracy is going to be somewhat academic.\n\nHmm. Pity about that. Maybe it's not the prettiest country in the world, but I could see where you could easily get fond of it.\n\nOmelettes and eggs, boy. Omelettes and eggs. He focused and put his wings back. The soldiers dropped their guns and ran for it; the demons stayed where they were. For some reason.\n\n'Trust me,' Prodsnap yelled. 'He knows that if he flames off here, he'll risk blowing up the power station, and then it'd be goodbye Europe. He won't do that.'\n\n'You reckon?'\n\n'Of course.' Prodsnap closed his eyes. 'He's the good guy.'\n\n'How'd you figure that out?'\n\n'Easy. George tried to kill him and couldn't. Speaks for itself. So all we have to do is keep perfectly still and the bugger'll peel off and fly away.'\n\n'Is that a promise?'\n\nProdsnap nodded. 'Trust me.'\n\nJob done.\n\nThe dragon banked again. Where the three demons had been, there was now just a big scorch-mark, a little molten rock. And a nuclear reactor going badly wrong.\n\nPity about that.\n\nNever mind.\n\nOmelettes and eggs.\n**CHAPTER SIXTEEN**\n\n**'O** h said Chardonay.\n\n'At least it didn't see us,' Snorkfrod replied, emerging from behind a pile of used tyres. 'Just as well, really, because if it had, we'd be—'\n\n'Yes. Quite.' Odd, he reflected. Given that he was now a naturalised citizen of Hell, he hadn't expected to be terrified by the sight of fire ever again. Quite nostalgic, really.\n\n'Mr C.'\n\n'Huh.'\n\n'I don't want to worry you at all, but I think this whole complex is about to blow up.'\n\nWhy is it, Chardonay caught himself thinking, that whenever there's a truly awful crisis, humans set off a ghastly, shrieking alarm? Mood music? Muzak? Even now, with the sky boiling and waves of heat you could bake cakes in, there were still humans busying about with clipboards and brown cardboard folders, convincing themselves it was all just a drill. Why do we wear our fingers to the bone trying to torment these people? They do a far better job of it left to their own devices.\n\n'We'd better be going, Mr C,' Snorkfrod urged. 'Come _on_.'\n\nShe tried to pull his sleeve, but he shook his arm free. 'No,' he said; and then looked round, trying to spot the smart-arse ventriloquist who'd hijacked his body to make such a damnfood remark. 'No, we can't just run. We've got to stop it happening. It's our _duty.'_\n\nSnorkfrod's eyes were as large and round as manhole covers. 'Mr C,' she hissed, 'this whole place, this whole _country,_ is about to blow up. There's nothing we can do. We'll be—'\n\n'Yes there is. There must be.'\n\nSnorkfrod's talons closed round his shoulder, nearly ripping it off. 'Don't be bloody stupid,' she shrieked. 'We're demons, we're from bloody _Hell,_ it's not our responsibility.'\n\n'Yes it is.' Chardonay carefully prised her talons apart and lifted them off him. 'We're officers of the central administration. And we're here, now, where it's happening.' He heard himself saying it; otherwise he'd never have believed he could say anything like it. Stark staring...\n\n'All right, Mr C. What can we do?'\n\nHe stared at her. Leadership? Love? Both of them daft as brushes? She was smiling at him. God, it was like being followed round by a great big stupid dog. If she had a lead in her mouth it wouldn't look out of place.\n\n'You sure?' he asked.\n\n'Of course I'm sure, Mr C. Where you go, I go.'\n\nIn which case, Chardonay reflected, it serves the silly bitch right.\n\n'Um,' he said. 'Okay. Yes. Er, follow me.'\n\nFrom safe to critical in four and a half minutes; too fast. Even a direct hit from an ICBM shouldn't have made it all happen so quickly. There was absolutely nothing anybody could do. Even running away would be a waste of energy.\n\nTwo minutes.\n\nChardonay's instinct told him to go by the heat; where it was hottest, that's where the heart of the problem would be. Heat in itself didn't worry him at all—\n\n\\- Except this was not hot. Back on Shopfloor, the accountants'd have forty fits if they found anywhere as hot as this. _Turn it down,_ they'd shriek, _have you any idea what last quarter's fuel bill came to?_\n\n'Are we going the right way, Mr C?'\n\n'Getting warmer, definitely. Dear God, how can they get it as hot as this?'\n\nNinety-eight seconds later, Snorkfrod shoulder-charged a massive lead-lined chrome steel door. When she collided with it, she found it was red hot and _soft_...\n\n'Bingo!' Chardonay blinked, found he had to look away.. 'Oh shit, now what?'\n\nSeventeen seconds to go. Chardonay's brain raced, performing feats of pure maths he'd never have believed himself capable of. Pointless in any event. There was only one thing that might conceivably work, and they were to all intents and purposes dead already, so why waste time doing the sums?\n\nChardonay turned to Snorkfrod. She was glowing bright orange and on her face was an expression of part horror, part rapture.\n\n'Oh, Mr C,' she said, in that gushing, cloying, Black-Forest-gateau-with-extra-cream voice of hers. 'It's all rather grand, isn't it? Being together at the end, I mean.'\n\nGawd help us. For a moment he wondered if Snorkfrod's unconquerable soppiness might be the only thing in Creation wet enough to put out the fire. On balance, probably not.\n\n'I love you, Mr C.'\n\n'Er, yes. Super. Now, when I give the word...'\n\nAnd, even as the two of them hurled themselves down onto the core and were reduced instantaneously into atoms, Chardonay did catch himself thinking, _Well, yes, if things had worked out different..._\n\nThere's nothing like bizarre and absolute annihilation to bring out the romantic streak in people.\n\nChardonay's last, pathetically futile idea was that the physical bodies of demons are the most heat-resistant material in the known cosmos. Throw two demons onto the fire, like an asbestos blanket onto a burning chip-pan, and there's a very slight chance you might put it out.\n\nHe was, of course, wrong. A whole brigade of spectral warriors might have done the trick if they'd parachuted in about eighty seconds earlier, before the meltdown entered its final phase. Two little devils leaping in at the last moment were always going to be as effective as an eggcupful of water thrown into a blast furnace.\n\nA lovely gesture, then; but completely pointless. Heroism is one thing, physics is something else. At the moment when the two demons threw themselves into the fire, only a miracle could have prevented the final cataclysm.\n\nDefine the term miracle.\n\nIt's got to be something Good - who ever heard of an Evil miracle? And it must be impossible or it doesn't count.\n\nThat leaves us with something nice that simply can't happen but does. Examples? Well, if we forget about tax rebates for the time being, how about a nuclear pile suddenly cooling down at the very last moment? Or two fiends from Hell giving their lives to save millions of innocent people?\n\nMiracles do happen, but only very, very rarely; like the hundred-to-one outsider suddenly accelerating out of nowhere to beat the odds-on favourite. You could make an awful lot of money betting on miracles, provided you knew for certain they were going to happen. But that, too, would be impossible. Nice, but impossible.\n\nWouldn't it?\n\nUnpalatable theological truth number 736: behind every miracle, there's usually an awful lot of syndicated money.\n\n'Just like that?' Chubby enquired.\n\n_Just like that._\n\nChubby sat still and quiet for a while, letting his mind skate round the implications. Just then, he'd have given anything for a simple pie-chart diagram showing how much of his soul was still his own. Not, he imagined, all that much.\n\n'So that's what we needed the dragon for,' he said. 'God, I must be getting thick in my old age.'\n\n_Not really. It took a genius to think it up in the first place. It would take a genius of almost equal standing to work it out from first principles. Don't be too hard on yourself just because you're not a genius._\n\nIt helped, Chubby found, to walk up and down, burning off a little of the surplus energy that his pineal gland was pumping into his system. 'A dragon,' he said, 'because nothing else on Earth would actually be crazy, wicked, stupid enough to torch a nuclear reactor and blow up a country.'\n\n_And even then I needed a pretext_ , _so he wouldn't suspect what I was really up to. Hence putting a contract out on the demons. Rather neat, I thought._\n\n'Whereupon,' Chubby went on, 'you laid a whopping great bet on the outcome. What odds did you get? Thousand to one?'\n\n_You think I'd go to all that trouble for a handful of piddling loose change? No, the odds were very satisfactory, thank you._\n\n'Splendid. I do so like a happy ending.' Chubby sat down behind his desk, broke a pencil and ground the bits into the carpet with his heel.\n\n_Another thing. You're being too hard on my old friend Fred._\n\n'Fred? Oh sorry, I forgot.'\n\n_You said crazy, wicked, stupid. Fred's none of those things. That's the mistake everybody always makes around dragons. I should know, I am one. Or had you forgotten?_\n\n'I did manage to remember, thank you.'\n\n_Dragons—_ Impossible, of course, for glowing green words on a screen to have any expression. Any subtext has to come from the mind of the reader. In Chubby's eyes, at least, the words on the screen grinned.\n\n_Dragons, you see, simply don't give a damn. Good and Evil's just biped stuff. Sure, you believe in it, the same way you used to believe in Father Christmas when you were little. We don't, is all. We don't mean anything by it._\n\n'I see.'\n\n_I doubt that. And you know something else? I couldn't give a shit._\n\nChubby gave the screen a long, level stare. For some reason, he found he could, without wanting to look away. His mind searched for a word and a word came: alien.\n\n_I thought they were little green men with radio aerials sticking out of their ears._\n\nChubby shook his head. 'Nah,' he replied. 'You could get fond of little green men.'\n\n'Hello,' said Prodsnap, without looking up. 'What kept you?'\n\nChardonay sat down in the seat next to him. 'Had to save the planet,' he replied. 'Any idea what sort of a mood He's in?'\n\nProdsnap shook his head. 'I haven't heard any shouting,' he replied. 'On the other hand, that's not necessarily a good sign.'\n\nThe five demons, wearing makeshift bodies issued to them from the huge wicker hamper colloquially known as the Dressing-Up Box, were sitting in a draughty corridor outside an office marked _Personnel Manager._ It isn't mentioned in Dante's _Inferno,_ mainly because Dante had always hoped one day to sell the film rights and so he wanted to keep the whole thing basically upbeat and free from utterly negative vibes. The famous inscription about abandoning hope was nailed above the lintel.\n\nSnorkfrod nudged Chardonay in the ribs.\n\n'We'd like you lot to be the first to know,' Chardonay said, saying it with all the passion and enthusiasm of the little voice in posh cars that tells you to fasten your seat belt. 'Snorkfrod and I are engaged.'\n\n'Strewth.' Slitgrind pulled a face. 'So you've been in already, have you?'\n\n'I beg your pardon?'\n\nSlitgrind nodded towards the office door. 'That's your punishment, is it, Char? I always knew he was a vindictive bugger, but ... Hey, Prozza, mind what you're doing, that was my shin.'\n\nProdsnap switched on a silly grin. 'Congratulations,' he croaked. 'I hope you'll both be very...'\n\nThe door opened. A secretary fiend, lump-headed and shark-jawed, beckoned them.\n\n'He'll see you now,' she said.\n\n'Sugar Fred Dragon?' Mr Kortright suggested.\n\n_Nah. Tacky._\n\n'Matter of opinion. All right then, Rocky Draciano. I like that. It's got class.'\n\n_Tacky._\n\n'Honey George Sanctus?' There was a slight edge of desperation in the agent's voice. Self-doubt wasn't usually a problem for Lin Kortright, in the same way that Eskimos don't lie awake at night fretting about heatstroke. This client, though, had him rattled.\n\n_Lin. It smells. Come on, you're supposed to be good at this sort of thing._\n\n'I am.' He'd nearly said _I was._ The sweat from his armpits would have irrigated Somalia.\n\n_Sure you are, Lin, sure you are. Now then, the venue. Any progress?_\n\nKortright nodded, realised that the screen couldn't see gestures (or could it? He was getting distinctly offbeat vibes off this thing. As they say in the Business, never work with computers or children). 'It's in the bag, Nosher,' he replied confidently. 'All set.'\n\n'Set? Or set-set?'\n\n'Set-set. I got a signed agreement with the Mongolian Ministry of Tourism and War—'\n\n_Tourism and War?_\n\n'Historical reasons, Nosher. Genghis Khan. The ultimate in encounter holidays, remember? Anyway, we've got a million-acre site between Mandalgovi and Dalandzadgad, they're gonna build us an airstrip—'\n\n_Fine. I'll leave all that sort of thing to you. As far as I'm concerned, all we really need is a very big flat space with a rope round it, and two corners._\n\nKortright's brow creased. 'Corners?'\n\n_Yes. You know; in the white corner, we have Saint George, representing Good, and in the black corner..._\n\n'Ah. Right. Got you. I'll fix that, no problem. Now then, the cola concession, I've got the Pepsi guys up to six million, but I'm expecting a fax any minute—'\n\n_Yes, yes. Deal with it, Lin, there's a good fellow. 'Bye for now._\n\nThe screen in Mr Kortright's office went dark. Another screen in Chubby's bunker (reinforced chronite, guaranteed to withstand anything less than a direct hit from a neutron star) flicked on.\n\n_Chubby._\n\n'Now what?'\n\n_Just a few things. Transport ..._\n\n'All done.' Chubby frowned. 'You got any idea how much a ship that size costs per day?'\n\n_Yes._\n\n'Then you'd better - oh.' Chubby hesitated. 'Any chance of a few quid on account?' he asked. 'Only, what with one thing and another, all this is causing me slight cashflow problems, plus I'm neglecting my business. I've got orders to meet, you know.'\n\n_Correct. Mine. And you will obey them without question. Lemons._\n\n'I'm sorry, I thought you just said lemons'\n\n_That's right. For the contestants to suck between rounds. Make sure there are plenty, will you? Or do I have to do everything myself?_\n\n'All right, Chubby replied, offended, 'keep your keyboard on. I've got a containerload of lemons on their way from Australia, together with sixty gallons of aviation fuel for the dragon. Apple brandy for George. Not too much, don't want him falling over. Okay?'\n\n_Well done. Finally, then; how are you actually going to get them onto the ship?_\n\nChubby smiled. 'I'm way ahead of you there,' he replied. 'How'd it be if we tried the old Ark routine? You know, a couple of days' synthetic rain beforehand, then I go around telling everybody I've had this message from God—?'\n\n_Chubby._\n\n'Yes?'\n\n_Don't try my patience, chum. I think I used to have some, but I haven't seen it around since 1946, and it's probably gone off by now. Get it sorted, there's a good lad._\n\nThe screen went blank. Chubby stuck his tongue out at it. Obviously it knew, but Chubby no longer cared terribly much.\n\nThis, he said to himself, is getting out of hand.\n\nIt was something, he knew, with the big gambling syndicate. You didn't need to be Einstein or A.J.P Taylor to work out that Nosher had been behind the original syndicate, the one that persuaded the dragon to throw the fight first time round, back in the Dark Ages. And it was as clear as a lighthouse on a moonless night that this rematch was going to be a fix as well. The question was, which one was he going to fix this time?\n\nAnd - big question, this—who did the syndicate bet with? It takes two to make a wager, and the last time he'd passed the local Coral office they hadn't been offering odds on the fight. So who was the mug punter the syndicate were fitting up? Who had that sort of money, anyhow?\n\nGod? No, strictly a matchsticks player. (And you thought all those forests in South America were just scenery?) Who, then? He shook his head. None of his damn business, anyhow.\n\nHere's hoping, he muttered to himself, it stays that way.\n\n_Don't be too hard on them, Phil._\n\nI WON'T. JUST ENOUGH SO THEY WON'T SUSPECT.\n\n_Good result, huh?_\n\nYOU WIN THIS TIME, NOSHER. NEXT TIME, MAYBE YOU WON'T BE SO LUCKY. NOT, I SOMETIMES GET THE IMPRESSION, THAT LUCK HAS ALL THAT MUCH TO DO WITH IT. I MEAN, WHY EXACTLY _DIDN'T_ THE FUCKING THING BLOW UP?\n\n_Can't imagine what you mean, Phil. Anyway, I'm looking forward to getting your cheque. Or shall we make it double or quits?_\n\nOutside, in the corridor, Chardonay and company could hear the thundering of the voice, but couldn't make out the words. Some other poor bastards getting their fortunes told, they assumed.\n\nYOU'RE ON, NOSHER. HERE'S TO THE NEXT TIME, RIGHT?\n\nAfter a hard afternoon's work in her studio - God, the Victoria Square project! Running about chasing the dragon was all very fine and splendid, but she had a commission to fulfil - Bianca had a quick sandwich and went straight to bed.\n\nShe slept badly.\n\nChasing the dragon - well, quite. There was still an influential part of her brain that wanted to treat the whole bloody mess as some sort of giant hallucination; bad dope, the DTs, cheese before bedtime, whatever. That was the comforting explanation. Untrue, of course. Whatever it was, it was still going on. In fact, she had an uneasy feeling it was approaching some sort of crisis. In which case, the sensible course of action would be to be standing outside the travel agents' when they opened tomorrow morning, asking for details of off-peak reductions to Alpha Centauri.\n\nWhen a person starts worrying about something around half past three in the morning, she might as well let out Sleep's room and put his clothes in the jumble sale because he sure as hell isn't coming back. To take her mind off it all, she switched on the TV and hit the Satellite news.\n\n_... In Victoria Square, Birmingham might somehow be linked to the wave of spectacular art thefts in Florence, Rome and Venice. In addition to Ms Wilson's two monumental works for the Birmingham City Corporation, no fewer than seventeen major statues have vanished from Italian collections, including eight Berninis, three Donatellos, three Cellinis, a Canova, the Giambologna_ Mercury, _and of course the priceless Michaelangelo_ David. _The only lead that Interpol have so far is the discovery of fingerprints apparently resembling those of Kurt Lundqvist, a notorious mercenary and soldier of fortune, discovered at the scenes of all the robberies in Italy. Lundqvist, however, is believed to have been killed some time ago in Guatemala, although the only part of him actually recovered was his left ear. Counter-insurgency experts have pointed out that, to judge by his past record, Lundqvist would have been perfectly capable of carrying out this remarkable string of burglaries single-handed, not to mention single-eared; indeed, they claim, if there's anyone capable of shrugging off Death as a minor inconvenience, that man would be Kurt Lundqvist, believed by many leading experts to be the link between the former Milk Marketing Board and the Kennedy assassination. This is Danny Bennett, Star TV News, in Florence._\n\nBugger sleep. As far as Bianca was concerned, Macbeth had beaten her to it.\n\nSeventeen statues. Seventeen is sixteen plus one. Sixteen people die in an explosion in a community centre in the West Midlands; sixteen statues simultaneously go missing in Italy. No, seventeen statues, sixteen plus one.\n\nWho was the seventeenth statue for?\n\nShe was still paddling this bizarre notion around in her brain when the phone rang, making her jump out of her skin. It took an awful lot of determination to pick the blasted thing up.\n\n'Hello?'\n\n'Bianca Wilson?' American voice, like audible sandpaper.\n\n'Yes, that's me. Who's this?'\n\n'You probably don't know me' the voice replied. 'My name's Kurt Lundqvist.'\n**CHAPTER SEVENTEEN**\n\n**'M** r Lund—'\n\nThe small man jumped out of his skin, whirled round and slapped a hand across her mouth. 'Don't call me that, you crazy bitch,' he hissed. 'C'mon, this way.'\n\nHe set off at a great pace, not looking round. Bianca had to break into a trot to keep up. He was shorter and squarer than she'd expected, but he moved as if he was tall, lean and wiry. Another one of these unquiet spirits in a Moss Bros body? It was as though the whole world was on its way to a fancy dress party.\n\n'Okay,' he said, finally halting. 'We can talk here.'\n\nMaybe, Bianca thought, but hearing what we say is going to be another matter entirely.\n\nIn reply to her earlier question, 'Where can we meet?' Kurt had suggested New Street station. They were now in the bar of a pub in John Bright Street, empty except for the barman and the loudest background music on Earth. This was foreground music. It filled all the available space, like Polyfilla.\n\n'Thank you for coming,' Kurt said.\n\n'Sorry?'\n\n'I SAID...' Kurt edged his chair nearer and leaned forwards. 'I said thanks for coming. Listen up, doll. This is a mess.'\n\nBianca frowned slightly. He'd told her briefly about the circumstances of his return to Earth and she reckoned 'doll' was a bit rich coming from an animated Action Man. Given the communication difficulties, though, she let it ride.\n\n(Note: to save time and preserve the Niagara-like cadences of the dialogue, all the backchat—'Sorry, what did you say?'; 'Speak up, for Chrissakes'; 'Dammit, there's no need to shout' etc, - has been edited, as a result of which, this passage has already been awarded the Golden Scissors at the 1996 Editor of the Year Awards, and the BSI kitemark.)\n\n'I know,' Bianca replied. 'You made it sound like there was something you could do about it.'\n\n'There is,' Kurt replied, sipping his Babycham. 'But not on my own. That's where you come in.'\n\n'I see.'\n\n'Doubt that.' Kurt finished his bag of pork scratchings, squashed up the packet and dropped it into the ashtray before lighting a cigar. A large cigar, needless to say; Bianca had seen smaller things being floated down Canadian rivers. 'Let me just fill you in on the background. Maybe you know some of the stuff I don't, at that.'\n\nBetween them, it transpired, they had a fairly good idea of the Story So Far, including recent developments and a progress report on the preparations for the Big Fight. 'So you see,' Kurt summarised, 'it's all a goddamn shambles.'\n\n'Quite.' Bianca nodded vigorously. 'Worst part of it is, I can't seem to work out who's who. Goodies and baddies, I mean.'\n\n'This,' Kurt replied sternly, 'ain't the movies. When you've been in supernatural pest control as long as me, you learn not to make judgements about people. Sure, when I was young, I used to worry about that kinda thing; you know, _What harm did he ever do me?_ and all that kinda shit. Nowadays, all I ask myself is, will the two-fifty grain hollow point do the business at three hundred and fifty yards. I guess it makes life easier, not giving a damn.'\n\n'You do, though, don't you?'\n\nKurt nodded glumly. 'It's a bitch,' he replied. 'Unprofessional. That's what's got to me about this stinking job. Trouble is, my professional ethics say I gotta do the job I'm being paid for. Nothing in the rules says I can't share my concerns with an outsider, though; someone not in the business, like yourself.'\n\nBianca shrugged. 'I've got professional ethics too, you know. Mostly they're to do with leaving chisel-marks and not glueing back bits you accidentally break off. But I'm sure there's something in the Code of Practice about not letting dangerous statues fall into the wrong hands. I must look it up when I get back home.'\n\nThey looked at each other suspiciously across the formica tabletop; unlikely confederates (if we're confederates, Bianca muttered to herself, bags I be Robert E. Lee) in an impossibly confused situation. In context, they were probably the least likely do-gooders in the whole dramatis personae; the hired killer and the arms dealer. Maybe it helped that Bianca also dealt in legs, heads and torsos.\n\n'I guess,' Kurt said slowly, 'in situations like this, all you can do is to try and do the right thing. Shit, did I really say that? This stinking job really is getting to me.'\n\n'A statue's gotta do what a statue's gotta do?'\n\n'Sure. Now, what _you_ gotta do is like this.'\n\n_Thank you for calling Acropolis Marble Wholesalers Limited._\n\n_Unfortunately there's no one here to take your call, so please leave a message after the tone._\n\nBeep.

'I've been virtually everywhere, I think, but usually I don't stop and buy a guide-book. What's Mongolia?'\n\nChubby shrugged. 'Desert, mostly. Very empty, not many people. Barren, too; large parts of it have as close to a zero per cent fire risk as it's possible to get on this planet. The sort of place where you could have a sneezing fit without burning down six major cities.'\n\n'Sounds a bit dull,' the dragon said.\n\n'It is. Very.'\n\n'I could use a little tedium right now,' the dragon said, scratching his nose with a harpoon-like claw. 'I take it you're working round to suggesting that I go there.'\n\n'Hate to lose you,' Chubby replied. 'It's been great fun having you here and all that. But, with all due respect, you're a bit hard on the fixtures and fittings.'\n\n'True. Actually, it beats me how you people can live in places like this without dying of claustrophobia.'\n\n'We're smaller than you are. We find it helps.'\n\nThe dragon yawned and stretched, inadvertently knocking an archway through the wall into the next room. 'Mongolia, then. What's your ulterior motive? Something to do with your Time business?'\n\n'You know your trouble? You're cynical.' Chubby frowned. 'Usually with good cause,' he added. 'As it so happens, there is a small job you could do for me while you're there. Nothing heavy. You might find it helps stave off death by ennui. Entirely up to you, though.'\n\n'Explain.'\n\n'Well.' Chubby leaned back in his chair and hit the light switch. A projector started to run, covering the opposite wall (the only one still intact) with a huge, slightly blurred image of a vase of flowers, upside down. Chubby clicked something, and the picture changed into a view of the Great Wall of China.\n\n'Familiar?'\n\n'Seen it before,' the dragon replied. 'Doesn't mean anything to me, though. A wall is but a wall, a sigh is but a sigh.'\n\n'Ah.' Chubby clicked again. The Great Wall came closer. 'This, my old mate, is no ordinary wall. It's big, it's famous and - now here's where my interest in the damn thing lies - it's very, very old.'\n\nThe dragon smiled in the darkness. 'Steeped in history, huh?'\n\n'Positively saturated. Now, I got to thinking; sentiment aside, what does that lot actually do that a nice modern chain-link fence couldn't do, for a fraction of the maintenance costs? Whereas to me—'\n\n'I get the picture,' the dragon interrupted, amused. 'You want me to steal it.'\n\nChubby clicked again. This time, the wall was covered in a view of the planet, as seen from space. The Great Wall was dimly visible, a thin line faintly perceptible through wisps of untidy cloud. Either that, or a hair in the gate.\n\n'As you can see for yourself,' Chubby went on, 'it's the only man-made structure visible from outside the Earth's atmosphere. An eyesore, in other words. If Mankind ever gets round to colonising the moon, I'll be doing them a favour.'\n\n'Quite. What do you want me to do with it after I've nicked it?'\n\nClick. View of a completely barren area of desert. 'Just leave it there. One of my people will deal with it.'\n\nThe dragon smiled. 'A receiver of stolen walls? A fence?'\n\n'How did I know you were going to say that?'\n\nHalf an hour later, the same picture show, the same basic introduction.\n\n'Let's just make sure I've got this straight,' George said.\n\n'Your organisation's going to steal the Great Wall of China?'\n\n'Mphm.'\n\n'And then they're going to dump it, out there in the wilderness.'\n\n'Not wilderness, George. Prime development site. We paid top dollar for that land. It has the advantage of being as far from anywhere as it's possible to get without having to wear an oxygen mask.'\n\nGeorge shrugged. 'You know your own business, I s'pose. What do you need me for?'\n\n'Caretaker, basically,' Chubby replied. 'I was just thinking, since your friend with the wings and the bad breath is still very much on the loose, you might quite fancy a month or so in the last place anybody would ever think of looking.'\n\n'Good point.' George nodded decisively. 'Much obliged to you. It'll be a pleasure.'\n\nThe lights came back on.\n\n'Pleasure's all mine,' said Chubby.\n\n_A bit over-complicated, surely?_\n\nChubby scowled. 'Listen,' he said. 'I hate to bother you with silly mundane things like the way I earn my living, but for the last couple of months my business has been at a complete standstill. I've got orders I can't fill and staff on full wages sitting around with nothing to do. Two birds, one stone, and everybody's happy.'\n\nThe screen went blank and the little red light, whose purpose Chubby had never been able to work out in all the years he'd had the wretched thing, blinked twice.\n\n_I'm not happy about this._\n\n'Tough. Sorry, but you said to find a way to get them both to the venue without arousing their suspicions and that's what I've done. And now, if you don't mind. I've got work—'\n\nThe pain hit him like a falling roof. The intensity of pain largely depends on which part of the victim it affects. Chubby's soul hurt. Toothache is nothing in comparison.\n\n'Fuck you, genie,' he moaned. 'Let go, will you?'\n\nInside his head, Chubby could hear laughter. It was a very frightening sound.\n\n_Chubby, please. After all we've been to each other, I think you can start calling me Nosher. All my friends do._\n\n'Then fuck you, _Nosher._ And now will you please stop doing that, before you break my id?'\n\n_Any idea how much of your soul I now own? I know you're curious. Go on, ask me._\n\nThe pain stopped and Chubby collapsed into a chair. 'Let me see,' he said, once he'd got his breath back. 'Well, for one thing, we haven't had nearly as much of the your-wish - is - my - command - it's - my - pleasure - to - serve - you bullshit lately, which I find rather significant. And all these cosy chats we've been having recently must be taking their toll. I've been trying very hard indeed not to think about it.'\n\n_Forty-two per cent._\n\n'Shit.'\n\n_No reason why that should be a problem, surely. We've always got on well enough, you and I._\n\n'Like a house on fire,' Chubby replied. 'With you as the fire and me as the house. What happens to me when you get a majority stake? Do I die, or vanish, or what?'\n\n_Perish the thought. It's just that we'll see even more eye to eye, that's all._\n\n'And when it reaches a hundred per cent?'\n\n_Then I shall be free._\n\n'Hooray, hooray. And what about me?'\n\n_You'll be one of the lucky ones. Like Mr Tanashima._\n\nChubby frowned. 'Don't know him. Who he?'\n\n_Mashito Tanashima. Born 1901, died 1945. He worked in a bicycle factory in Hiroshima, Japan. Seven minutes before the atomic bomb exploded, he was killed in a road accident._\n\n'Gosh.' Chubby smiled bleakly. 'Lucky old me, huh?'\n\nThe screen flickered. The red light came on and, this time, stayed on.\n\n_Yes. Let nobody say I'm not grateful._\n\nBianca stepped back to admire her work. A masterpiece, as always. Three down, fourteen to go.\n\nThe biggest problem had been getting hold of the photographs. First, she'd tried the local paper, but they'd got suspicious and refused to co-operate. The victims' families had virtually set the dogs on her. Finally, she'd hit on the idea of sending Mike round pretending to be the organiser of a Sadley Grange Disaster Fund. She'd felt very bad about that, but he'd come away with all the photographs she needed.\n\nThe walls of her studio were covered in them; enlarged, reduced, montaged, computer-enhanced, until the very sight of them gave her the creeps. Sixteen very ordinary people who happened to have been in the Sadley Grange Civic Centre when it blew up. The victims.\n\nSo far she'd done Mrs Blanchflower, Mrs Gray and Mr Smith, and she was knackered. Straight portraiture, no dramatic poses or funny hats; they had to be as lifelike as possible or the whole thing would be a waste of time. The worst part of it all was the responsibility, because she wasn't the one who was going to have to live with the consequences for the rest of her life if she made a mistake. Accidentally leave off a toe, or get an arm out of proportion, and she'd be ruining somebody's life.\n\nThe hell with that, she told herself. Makes it sound like they're doing me a favour.\n\nYes. Well. And whose dragon caused all this mess in the first place?\n\n'Mike,' she croaked, 'I need a brand new set of the big chisels, another hide mallet and coffee, about a gallon and a half. Would you...?'\n\n'On my way.'\n\n'Mrs Cornwall's nose. Could you do me a six by four enlargement of the wart? I can't see from this whether it's a straightforward spherical type or more your cottage loaf job.'\n\n'No problem.'\n\nShe sighed, wiped her forehead with her sleeve. 'And when you've done that,' she said, 'if you could see your way to making a start on roughing out Mrs Ferguson with the angle grinder. I've marked her up, and it'd save ever such a lot of time.'\n\n'Mrs Ferguson, angle grinder. Right you are.'\n\n'Oh, and Mike.'\n\n'Yes?'\n\n'Thanks.'\n\nMike laughed, without much humour. 'That's all right,' he said. 'After all, what are friends for? Apart, that is, from heavy lifting, telling lies to next of kin, basic catering and other unpaid chores?'\n\n'Dunno. Moral support?'\n\nMike shrugged. 'Don't ask me,' he said, 'my morals collapsed years ago. Be seeing you.'\n\nLeft alone, Bianca tried to clear her mind of everything except the technicalities of sculpture. Easier said than done; it was like clearing a pub on Cup Final night, only rather more difficult. The hardest part, unexpectedly enough, was the way the faces from the photographs stayed in her mind, plastered across her retina like fly-posters, even when her eyes were tight shut. That meant something, she felt sure, but she hadn't the faintest idea what.\n\n'Excuse me.'\n\nKurt stopped dead in his tracks, closed his eyes and counted to ten. Once upon a time, that particular ritual had been a foolproof method of keeping his temper. Now all it meant was that he lost his rag ten seconds later.\n\n'Hi,' he replied, cramming a smile onto his face, which had never been exactly smile-shaped at the best of times. These past few days, however, cheerful expressions tended to perch apprehensively on his features, like a unicyclist crossing a skating rink.\n\n'Mr Lundqvist.' It was the Canova again. 'May I have a word with you, please?'\n\n'Lady...'\n\nInside the Classical perfection of the Canova bivouacked all that was immortal of Mrs Blanchflower. By a prodigious effort of his imagination, Kurt had worked out a scenario where he would actually be pleased to see Mrs Blanchflower, but it involved her being in the water and him being a twenty-foot-long Mako shark. The only reason why he hadn't yet mortally insulted her was because he never seemed to be able to get a word in edgeways.\n\n'Mr Lundqvist,' said the Canova. 'Now, as you know, I'm the last person ever to complain about anything, but I really most protest, in the strongest possible...'\n\nGetting past Mrs Blanchflower, of course, was the beginning, not the end, of the aggravation. She was the worst individual specimen, yes, the gold medallist in the Pest Olympics, but there were fourteen others right behind her sharing silver. And it's no real escape to elude one Mohammed Ali only to be set upon by fourteen Leon Spinkses.\n\n'SHUTTUP!' Kurt therefore bellowed, as he shouldered past the Canova into the main area of the Nissen hut. That bought him, albeit at terrible cost, a whole half second of dead silence.\n\n'And LISTEN!' he said. 'Thank you. Now then, folks, gather round. And you better pay attention, 'cos this is important.'\n\nFifteen statues all started to complain at once.\n\n'Okay.' Kurt backed away and climbed onto a chair. 'Okay,' he repeated, just loud enough to be audible. 'If you guys don't want to go home, that's up to you. Well, so long. It's been...'\n\nSilence. Well, virtual silence. Mrs Hamstraw (by Bernini) finished her sentence about the sultanas in her muesli (she'd _told_ him, _three_ times, the doctor had told her no sultanas) and Ms Stones reiterated her threat of writing to Roger Cook for the seventy-eighth time, but apart from that there was a silence so complete, Kurt felt he knew what it must have been like at five to nine on the first day of Creation.\n\n'On the other hand,' he went on, calm and quiet as the Speaking Clock, 'anybody who wants out had better listen good. Now, then...'\n\n'I still say that, after last time ...'\n\nThe Great Goat turned his head about twenty-seven degrees and scowled.\n\n'Thank you,' he said, in a voice you could have freeze-dried coffee in. 'Shall we proceed?'\n\nA nice man, Dr Thwaites; all his patients would have agreed, likewise his colleagues, his neighbours, even some of his relations. A kind man, for whom nothing would ever be too much trouble. A patient man, prepared to listen politely and attentively to every hypochondriac who ever thought mild indigestion was a heart attack. But flawed, nevertheless. Albert Schweitzer was the same, and likewise Walt Disney.\n\n'If you insist,' muttered the Lesser Goat. 'Now then, where's that wretched skull?'\n\nBecause Dr Thwaites, having paid Farmer Melrose six months' rent for conjuring rites on Lower Copses Meadow, was damned if he was going to forfeit half his money - thirty pounds, fifty pence - with three months still to run. It was, as far as he was concerned, a matter of principle.\n\n'When you're ready, Miss Frobisher. Now then.' He cleared his throat. 'By Asmoday and Beelzebub I conjure you, spirits of—' He stopped. If someone had just popped an apple in his mouth, they couldn't have shut him up quicker or more effectively.\n\n'Don't mind us,' said the Captain of Spectral Warriors, in a soft, speaking-in-church voice. 'Just pretend we aren't here, okay?'\n\nThe Great Goat would dearly have liked to do just that, but unfortunately it was out of the question. It takes a special sort of mental discipline to ignore five hundred of Hell's finest, in full battledress uniform, all displaced heads, unexpected limbs and weird appendages, creeping stealthily past you in the early hours of the morning.\n\n\"Ere, doc,' said the thurifer at his elbow. 'You're really good at this, aren't you?'\n\nThe Great Goat swallowed hard. 'Apparently,' he said. In his subconscious he was wondering whether he could persuade Mr Melrose to impose a retrospective rent increase, because the thought of performances like this every week for the next three months was enough to drive a man insane. He'd have to rethink all his cosy preconceptions about anatomy, for a start.\n\n'Excuse me.' The Captain was talking to him. He forced himself to listen.\n\n'Sorry, I was, um, miles away. Can I, er, be of assistance?'\n\n'We're trying to get to—' The Captain consulted a clipboard. 'Place called Birmingham. Would you happen to know where that is?'\n\n'Birmingham.'\n\n'That's right. I've got this map here, but it hasn't photocopied terribly well, so if you could just set us on the right track, we'd be ever so grateful.'\n\nHis disbelief suspended on full pay, the Great Goat felt in the pockets of his robes and produced a pencil and the back of an envelope.\n**CHAPTER EIGHTEEN**\n\n**T** he Big Fight.\n\nSeen purely from the viewpoint of logistics and administration, it was the greatest show in history. Everybody who was, had been or would be anybody was there, and the complexities of setting up a switchboard for the retrospective booking office had taxed Mr Kortright's ingenuity to its fullest extent. Or take the popcorn concession, a chronological disaster poised to happen. Any popcorn eaten by visitors from the past or the future would leave a serious imbalance in the fabric of reality, particularly after it had passed through the visitor's digestive system and entered the ecology of his native century. In order to compensate, Kortright had had to estimate the amount of popcorn likely to be eaten and arrange for compensatory amounts of matter to be removed from/added to a whole series of past and future destinations. As for the envelope of artificial Time in which the auditorium was contained, it had cleaned out Chubby's stocks down to the last second. God only knew what would happen if the fight lasted beyond the twelfth round.\n\nAll these problems, of course, were more than adequately accounted for in the price of the tickets; and that caused yet another organisational nightmare, given that (for example) in order to pay for his ticket the Emperor Nero had leeched out the entire economy of the Roman Empire, which could only mean total fiscal meltdown, violence in the streets and the fall of the Empire several centuries ahead of schedule. Fortunately, a client of Lin Kortright's who controlled various financial syndicates in the first century AD was able to offer bridging finance; disaster was averted, ten per cent was earned for the Kortright Agency, and Nero (who paid the first instalment of the loan by insuring Rome and then burning it down) was sitting in the front row, munching olives and trying unsuccessfully to persuade Genghis Khan to take St George to win at fifteen to one.\n\nThere was also a band, and cheer-leaders, and huge spotlights producing as much light and heat as a small star, and commentators from every TV station in Eternity all getting ready to provide simultaneous coverage (live was, in context, a word best avoided), and cameras and film crews and sound crews and men in leather jackets with headphones on wandering about prodding bits of trailing flex and engineers swearing at each other, and all the spectacle and pageantry of a galaxy-class sporting event. The panel of judges (two saints, two devils and, representing the saurian community, two enormous iguanas) were sworn in. There was an awed hush as the doors at the back swung open to admit the referee; no less a dignitary than Quetzalcoatl, Feathered Serpent of the Aztecs. Had his worshippers in pre-Conquest Mexico known that when he promised to come again to judge the quick and the dead, he meant this, maybe they'd have been a little bit less forthcoming with the gold and blood sacrifices.\n\nIt was nearly time. The food vendors left the auditorium, trays empty. The roar of voices dwindled down to an expectant buzz. All it needed now was for the contestants to show up, and the contest for the ethical championship of the universe could begin.\n\nAnd Kortright turned to Stevenson and said, 'Well, where the fuck are they?'\n\nAnd Stevenson leant across to Kortright and said, 'I thought they were with you.'\n\n'Finished,' Bianca gasped.\n\nForget the aesthetics for a moment; in terms of sheer stamina, it was the greatest achievement in the history of Art. With an effort she unclenched her cramped fingers sufficiently to allow chisel and mallet to fall to the ground and collapsed backwards into her chair, only to find there was someone already sitting in it.\n\n_'Sakubona, inkosazana.'_ Bianca did a quick Zebedee impression, looked down and saw a little, wizened man curled up in her chair. He was wearing a leopard skin with lots of unusual accessories, and holding a fly-whisk.\n\n'Hi,' she replied. 'You must be Nkunzana. I didn't hear you come in.'\n\n'No,' the witch-doctor replied, 'you didn't.' He nodded towards the statues. 'Impressive,' he said.\n\n'All my own work,' Bianca replied, flustered. 'You know what you've got to do?'\n\n'Is the Pope a Catholic?'\n\n'Right. Well, I'd better leave you to it, then. Do you need anything? Um, hot water, towels, that sort of thing?'\n\nNkunzana shook his head. 'A fire and a pinch of dust, my sister,' he replied. Before Bianca could offer further assistance, he produced a big brass Zippo from the catskin bag hung round his neck.\n\n'Dust?'\n\nNkunzana grinned and drew a fingertip across the surface of the table beside his chair. 'I know,' he said. 'I remind you of your mother.'\n\n'In certain respects,' Bianca replied. 'She could never have worn leopard, though. Not with her colouring.'\n\nThe witch-doctor shrugged; then, with a tiny movement of his thumb he lit the lighter, sprinkled the dust and mumbled something that Bianca didn't quite catch.\n\nAnd...\n\n... _Action_!\n\nCut to -\n\nKurt's Nissen hut (you could call it the Galleria Lundqvist, but not, if you want to see tomorrow, while he's listening) where fifteen statues with strong West Midland accents are telling him exactly why they refuse to have anything at all to do with his plan.\n\nSound effects; rushing wind, a shimmering tinkly sound (shorthand for magic), deep and rumbling unworldly laughter, followed by—\n\nSilence. The other noises off were just meretricious effects, the parsley garnish on a slice of underdone magic. But the silence, the absence of querulous whining, that's something else. Uncanny is an understatement in the same league as describing the Black Death as a nasty bug that's going around.\n\nKurt reacts; he says -\n\n_'YIPPEE_! _'_\n\n\\- and so would you if you'd just spent several weeks cooped up with Mrs Blanchflower, Mr Potts and thirteen others, extremely similar. In their place, fifteen of the world's finest, most exquisite statues; solid masonry from head to toe, without enough sentience between the lot of them to animate a DSS counter clerk. Kurt looked round, gazing ecstatically at each one in turn; compared to him, stout Cortes would have made one hell of a poker player. No more whingeing. No more threats to report him to the English Tourist Board. No more caustic remarks about the lack of brown sauce to go with the escalops of veal.\n\nSlowly, almost like a moon-walker in the deliberation of his movements, Kurt got to his feet, crossed the floor and picked up a frozen tiramisu he'd been defrosting for tonight's dinner. Then he planted himself in front of the Canova, stuck his tongue out, raised the tiramisu and rubbed it into the statue's face.\n\nCut to -\n\nBianca's studio. Bianca has just left, leaving the door unlocked and a note.\n\nCue sound effects, as above, except for the silence. Instead, fade in a yammering fugue of West Midland voices raised in pique. And hold it, as -\n\nThe statues realise something has changed. Typically thoughtful, Bianca has left a big, clothes-shop style mirror facing them. They see themselves. Let's repeat that line, for emphasis. They see ...\n\n_Themselves_ ...\n\nSilence.\n\nAnd then one of them - yes, absolutely right, it's Mrs Blanchflower—says -\n\n_'Well_! _'_\n\n\\- and they all start talking at once. No need to report the exact words spoken; the gist of it is that they're all as pleased as anything to be out of those ridiculous, freezing cold, uncomfortable statues and back in their own bodies again, _but_ that doesn't alter the fact that they've been mucked about something terrible (with hindsight, scrawling _Sorry for any inconvenience_ on the mirror in lipstick wasn't the most tactful thing Bianca ever did) and just wait, someone hasn't heard the last of this, my lawyers, my husband, my Euro MP...\n\nAt the back of the room, a scruffy heap which at first sight was only a bundle of old rags sits up, double-takes and huddles down again, furtively pulling a mangy leopard skin over his head and hoping to hell they haven't spotted him. Too late—\n\nWith a simultaneous yowl of fury, fifteen angry ex-statues turn on Nkunzana, shaking fists and demanding explanations. The witch-doctor freezes, unable to move. In the course of his professional activities, he's daily called upon to face down swarms of gibbering unquiet spirits, quell mobs of loutish ghosts by sheer force of personality, command fiends and boss about the scum of twelve dimensions. Piece of cake. Faced with Mrs Blanchflower and the other Sadley Grange victims, he's a mongoose-fazed snake.\n\n_Spirits,_ he hisses under his breath, _I command you by Nkulunkulu, the Great One,_ get _me the hell out of here!_\n\nThe spirits attend, as they are bound to do when a master of the Art orders them. Although only the _isangona_ can see them, they're there, as present as a college of notaries, standing at the back of the room looking extremely embarrassed.\n\n_Sorry, amakhosi,_ they mouth noiselessly. _This time, you're on your own._\n\nCut to -\n\nA police station on the very northernmost edge of China. Behind the desk, a sergeant slumbers dreamlessly under a circular fan.\n\nThe door opens. Enter three very embarrassed-looking men.\n\nThey wake the sergeant, who grunts and reaches for his notebook and a pen. What, he enquires, can he do for them?\n\nThey nudge each other. Imploring looks are exchanged. Nobody wants to be the one who has to say it.\n\nA spokesman is finally selected. He clears his throat. The expression on his face is so pitiful the desk sergeant starts groping instinctively for a clean handkerchief.\n\nWe'd like, the spokesman mumbles, to report a theft.\n\nRight. Fine. What's been nicked?\n\nA wall.\n\nSorry?\n\nA wall. Quite a big wall, actually.\n\nLook, sorry about this, did you just say somebody's stolen a _wall?_\n\nThat's right. Here, come and see for yourself.\n\nBemused policeman rises, totters sleepily round the edge of the counter to the station door, looks out.\n\nLook, is this some sort of a joke, because if it is ...\n\nAnd then he sees the mountains. And that's really _weird,_ because everybody knows you can't see the mountains from here. Because the Wall's in the way. Further up the valley, yes, you can see the mountains. Down here ...\n\nThe sergeant begins to scream.\n\nCut to—\n\nA brain-emptying vastness of sand, where the reflected heat hits you like a falling roof. Shimmering in the heat-haze, the sun flickers like an Aldis lamp. No wicked stepmother's smile was ever as cruel as the unvarying blue of the pitiless sky. Sun and sand; yes, sun and sand we got, but you really don't want to come here for two weeks in August.\n\nDeserts are, by definition, big; and this is a big desert.\n\nThe dragon, waiting in the shade of the huge stack of cardboard boxes that contains the Great Wall of China for his scheduled rendezvous with Chubby and the boys, looks tiny; from a distance you'd think he was a wee lizard, the sort of thing desert travellers evict from their boots every morning before setting out.\n\nBut that's perspective playing tricks on you, because the dragon is, of course, huge. And, more to the point, quite incredibly strong. Maybe you haven't yet realised how strong the dragon is; well, consider this. Between one and five am last night, this dragon single-handedly dismantled the Great Wall and lugged it here, boxful by boxful across the Gobi Desert, without making a sound or disturbing anybody. No real trouble; to the dragon, it was just like picking up so much Lego off the living-room carpet.\n\nIt was still, nevertheless, one hell of a lot of Lego, and the effort, combined with the heat, is making him sleepy. His soul (for want of a better word) is hovering in the middle air, looking down at the stack of boxes and thinking, Pretty _neat, huh_?\n\nThen, suddenly, it starts to panic. Instinctively it makes to dart back into its body, but it can't. Imagine that nauseating feeling when you've just stepped outside to get the milk in and the front door slams shut behind you, locking you out. Normally, the dragon's soul would have the door kicked in and be back inside in twenty seconds flat. But this time, what with purloining walls all night and not getting much sleep while it was at it, it simply hasn't got the strength. Which is unfortunate, because ...\n\nCut to -\n\nSaint George, toiling wearily up a vast sand escarpment, on his way to the scheduled rendezvous with Chubby, the boys and a billion tons of hooky masonry.\n\nHe feels - strange ...\n\nOh look, he mutters to himself, I'm flying.\n\nOr at least part of me is. The rest of me - head, arms, torso, legs - is down there on the deck, flat on my face ...\n\n( _Cue rushing wind, shimmering tinkly sound, shorthand for magic, deep and rumbling unworldly laughter_ . . .)\n\nNkunzana, moving with remarkable agility for a man of his advanced years, shinned out of the bathroom window, dropped five feet onto the fire escape, clattered down the steps like a ten-year-old and sprinted across the alleyway to where Kurt had the van parked, engine running.\n\n'Quick!' he panted. No need to explain further. There was a squeal and a smell of burning rubber.\n\n'Okay?' Kurt asked, glancing down at the road map open on his knee.\n\n'No,' snapped the witch-doctor, 'it isn't. You might have warned me.'\n\n'Warned you?' Kurt grinned. 'Hey, man, I wouldn't insult you. I mean, you being a witch-doctor and all, I'd have thought you'd have _known...'_\n\n'The hell with you, white boy. Let's see if it's so funny when I've turned you into a beetle.'\n\nFeeling that the conversation was becoming a little unfocused, Bianca interrupted. 'What Kurt meant to say was,' she said, 'is everything going to plan? With the, um, spirits, I mean?'\n\n'Huh?' Nkunzana frowned, then nodded. 'Sure, no problem. The fifteen dead people are out of the stolen statues and into the statues you made for them. The same with the souls of the dragon and Saint George; I've conjured them out of their bodies, and the dragon'll be too knackered after all that heavy lifting he's been doing...'\n\nThe old man paused, his eyes tight shut, and chuckled. 'Hey, man,' he muttered, 'this is _fun._ I really wish you could see this.'\n\nCut to—\n\nThree disembodied spirits, hovering in the upper air.\n\nThe first is the dragon, scrabbling frantically at the door of his magnificent, wonderful, all-powerful body. But he's too weak. He can't open the damn thing.\n\nThe second is Saint George, also unexpectedly evicted from his body by the Zulu doctor's magic. Not _his_ body, strictly speaking; remember, he's been dossing down in the statue Bianca made for Mike to live in, which he stole when the dragon carbonised him on his return from the future.\n\nGeorge is just about to nip back in when he realises he's not the only disembodied spook out and about this fine Mongolian summer morning. A mere hundred miles or so to his west, he becomes aware of the soul of his oldest, greatest enemy, and, more to the point, the empty dragon body.\n\nHe hesitates. He thinks.\n\n_YES!_\n\nWell, wouldn't you? Think it over. Yours for the hijacking, the most powerful, the strongest, the most stylish, the fastest, the most heavily armed and armoured, the slinkiest piece of flesh ever in the history of the Universe, with the doors unlocked and the keys in the ignition. One swift, slick job of taking and driving away, and then we'll see exactly who's vapourising whom ...\n\nWith a none too gentle shove and a merry shout of, 'Move over, asshole!', George heaved the dragon's enervated soul out of the way, scrambled into the dragon body and hit the gas. There was a roar and a stunning thump, as the beast's enormous wings scooped up air like ice-cream from the tub. Wild with fury and terror, the dragon's soul scrabbled desperately at its own body, but there was no way in. A fraction of a second later, the body had gone.\n\n'Shit,' whimpered the dragon. He collapsed onto the sand and started to quiver.\n\nThe third spirit in waiting is Bianca's friend Mike. He has the advantage over the other two of knowing what's going on, and the moment George abandons his earthly overcoat and makes his dash for the dragon costume, Mike lets himself quietly out of Saint George, marble statue by Bianca Wilson, and tiptoes across the middle air to where his own familiar shape is standing, vacant and unlocked, among the dunes. He drops in. He rams the legs into first gear. He scrams.\n\nAnd now the dragon's soul is alone. Ebbing fast, still weak from his exertions and the devastating trauma of watching his own body zooming off over the horizon with his mortal enemy at the controls, he flickers on the edge of dissolution. Why bother? he asks himself. Bugger this for the proverbial duffing up to nothing.\n\nBut not for long. Because dragons don't quit. And, as the saying goes, a third-class ride beats the shit out of a first-class walk. There, abandoned on the escarpment of a dune, stands Bianca Wilson's statue of Saint George, empty. Disgusted but grimly determined, the soul of the last of the great serpents of the dawn of the world drags itself through the dry, gritty air and flops wretchedly into George.\n\nAnd notices something. And suddenly feels a tiny bit better, because it suggests, somehow, that more than meets the eye is going on.\n\nBecause, in the back window of Saint George, somebody has stuck a little bit of shiny white cardboard, with five words written on it in red lipstick. They were:\n\n**MY OTHER CAR'S A PORSCHE**\n\nYes, mutters the dragon, suddenly and savagely cheerful. Isn't it ever.\n\nLike a salmon leaping the waterfall of the sun, the great dragon soared; wings incandescent, fire streaming off his flawlessly armoured flanks, the scream of the slipstream drowning out all sounds except the exultant crowing of his own triumphant soul, which sang:\n\n_Sheeeeit! Wow! Fuck me_! _Is this a bit of all right, then_ , _or what_?\n\nNow bursting up through the clouds like a leaping dolphin, now swooping like a hunting eagle; now high, now low, as the intoxication of flight and power made his brain swim, his blood surge. Mine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, for ever and ever.\n\nAnd then a light flashed soberingly bright in his eyes and he glanced down. There, on the desert floor below him, two men stood beside a Land Rover, on which was mounted a huge mirror.\n\nDragons have eyes like hawks - that's a very silly thing to say, because hawks are just birds, whereas dragons' eyes are the finest optical instruments in the cosmos; the point being, although the two men were a long way away, George recognised them easily. Chubby Stevenson and the man Kortright; he'd seen him about the place, though he didn't know who he was. Intrigued, he swooped.\n\n'Hey,' Kortright yelled through a bullhorn. 'Where the fuck you been? Get down here like _now.'_\n\nIt then occurred to George that they didn't know it was him. They thought it was the dragon - his, George's, enemy. Yet these people were supposed to be his friends, good guys. The hell with that! He filled his lungs and took aim—\n\nNo, they'll keep. Let's find out what's going on before we fry anybody we might be able to use later.\n\n'Hey,' George drawled. 'Where's the fire?'\n\n'It's where it isn't that's pissed me off, man,' Kortright replied. 'C'mon, get your tail in gear, we got people waiting.'\n\n'People?' George hovered, his front claws folded, a what-time-of-night-do-you-call-this expression on his face. 'What people?'\n\nStevenson, he noticed, was looking a little sheepish as he leaned over and whispered something in Kortright's ear. The agent stepped back and stared at him.\n\n'You arrange the biggest fight of all time,' he said, 'and you never get around to telling the contestants?'\n\nGeorge quivered; the word _fight_ had hijacked his imagination and was demanding to be flown to Kingdom Come. 'What fight?' he asked.\n\n'You and Saint George,' Chubby replied. 'The rematch. I was, um, planning it as a surprise.'\n\n'You succeeded.'\n\nChubby scowled. 'Dunno why you're sounding all snotty about it,' he replied self-righteously. 'That is what you want, isn't it? A chance to sort that little shit out once and for all? I mean, that is why you came back in the first place, right?'\n\n'Sure thing.' George nodded vigorously. 'Teach the little toe-rag a lesson he won't live long enough to forget.'\n\n'Well, then.'\n\nA smile swept across the dragon's face, in the same way that barbarian hordes once swept across Europe. 'I call that very thoughtful of you,' he said, 'going to all that trouble just to please me. But what makes you think the little chickenshit'll have the balls to show up? If I was him, the moment I heard about the fight I'd be off.'\n\n'He doesn't know about the fight, stupid.'\n\n'You mean,' said George, grinning cheerfully, 'you set him up?'\n\n'Yeah, yeah. Look—'\n\n'From the outset?'\n\n'Sure.' Chubby looked at him strangely. 'What's got into you all of a sudden?' he demanded.\n\n'Not what. Who. But that's beside the point, we'll sort it out later. So, where should I go?'\n\nKortright pointed due north. 'You'll know what it is as soon as you see it,' he said. 'Hang round just out of sight till we show up with George. Then it'll be over to you, okay? And don't say I don't find you quality gigs, you ungrateful asshole.'\n\nGeorge nodded gravely. 'I think I'll be able to handle it from then on,' he said. 'Be seeing you.'\n\nNot long afterwards, Chubby's helicopter landed beside the huge artificial mountain of packing cases that had appeared overnight in the middle of the desert, and two men climbed out, crouching to avoid the spinning rotor blades.\n\n'George,' they were yelling. _'George_! Where is the goddamn ...?'\n\nThey found him fast asleep in a sort of masonry igloo he'd made for himself at the foot of the mountain. This made their job much easier. Chubby slipped the handcuffs into place while Kortright woke him up.\n\n'Hi, George,' Chubby said. 'Look, no need for alarm, but we need you to do something for us and we really haven't got time to convince you it's a good idea before we set off for the venue. This way, we can convince you as we go, and you won't waste time by running away and hiding.'\n\n'Suits me.'\n\nThe two men looked at each other. 'Good of you to be so reasonable,' Chubby said. 'This way, then.'\n\nIn the chopper, Chubby explained that when he'd rescued George from the police in Birmingham, he'd had an ulterior motive.\n\n'You rescued ... Yes, sorry, me and my tea-bag memory. Do forgive me, carry on.'\n\n'Yup.' Chubby had a vague feeling that something was going wrong, but that was so close to his normal mental state that he ignored it. 'You see, it's this damn dragon.'\n\n'Oh yes.'\n\n'Sure.' Chubby sighed, his face a picture of frustration and annoyance. 'The bloody thing is starting to be a real pest, you know? Something's got to be done about it, before it ruins my business and destroys a major city or something.'\n\n'I quite understand,' said the dragon, nodding. 'This planet ain't big enough for the three of us, that sort of thing.'\n\n'Three? Oh, I see what you mean. Well, of course, I don't have to tell you, you want to see the fucker gets what's coming to him as badly as I do. Well, now's your chance.'\n\n'Really and truly?'\n\n'Really,' said Chubby, smiling, 'and truly. That's why Mr Kortright here -'\n\nKortright smiled. 'Hi, George.'\n\n'Hi, Mr Kortright. Haven't we met somewhere?'\n\n'Quite possibly, George, quite possibly.'\n\n'Mr Kortright,' Chubby went on, 'and I have arranged this, um, fight to the death. You and Mr Bad Guy. We built you an arena and everything. You're gonna love it.'\n\n'Quite,' said the dragon. 'Only, and I hate to seem downbeat here, don't you think the fight's going to be ever so slightly one-sided? I mean, him with the wings and the tail and the fiery breath, me with a sword? Not that I'm chicken or anything, but...'\n\nKortright chuckled. 'Tell him, Chubby.'\n\n'We've sorted all that,' Chubby said. 'We've got you some back-up. The best, in fact. The name Kurt Lundqvist mean anything to you?'\n\n'No.'\n\nChubby shrugged. 'After your time, I guess. Well, just as the dragon comes hell-for-leather at you out of, so to speak, a cloudless sky, Kurt \"Mad Dog\" Lundqvist'll be poised and ready in a concealed bunker under the press box with a very nasty surprise for Mr Dragon. He won't know what hit him. And neither, more to the point, will the punters. They'll think it was you. Neat trick, huh?'\n\n'Chubby.' The dragon looked shocked. 'Surely that's _cheating.'_\n\n'Yes. You got a problem about that?'\n\nThe dragon's eyes gleamed, and if Chubby failed to notice, consciously at least, that they were yellow with a black slit for a pupil, that was his fault. 'Ignore me,' the dragon said. 'I think it's a wonderful plan. Thank you ever so much for arranging it all. You must let me find some way to pay you back.'\n\n'George,' Chubby said, 'my old pal, forget it. I mean, what are friends for?'\n\nThe dragon shook his head. 'Chubby,' he said, 'and Lin. This is one favour I won't be forgetting in a hurry, believe me. Okay, let's go. I can hardly wait.'\n**CHAPTER NINETEEN**\n\n**K** urt had allowed himself twenty minutes to get from Birmingham to the heart of the Gobi Desert. Thanks to the small flask of concentrated Time which Chubby had issued him with, it proved to be ample.\n\nAn imposing figure was waiting for him round the back of the gents' lavatory. It was wearing a Brooks Brothers suit over its lurid, misshapen body, and a pair of dark glasses perched on the bridge of its beak.\n\n'Hi,' Kurt said. 'Sorry if I kept you waiting.'\n\n'Bang on time, Mr Lundqvist,' replied the Captain of Spectral Warriors, handing over a suitcase. 'Here's the doings. Best of luck.'\n\nKurt grinned. 'Luck,' he said, 'is for losers. You got your boys standing by?'\n\n'In position. You can rely on them to do a good job.'\n\nKurt picked up the suitcase. 'Be seeing you, then.' He started to walk away, but the Captain stopped him.\n\n'Mr Lundqvist,' he said. 'I'm curious.'\n\n'Yeah, but don't let it get to you. The shades help. A bit.'\n\n'I'm curious,' the Captain went on, 'about which of them you're gonna take out. Yeah, sure I got my orders, I don't actually need to know at this stage. I was just wondering...'\n\nKurt grinned, a big, wide grin that'd make a wolf climb a tree. 'Watch this space,' he said. 'Then you'll know for sure.'\n\nGeorge circled, keeping high'.\n\nBorn yesterday? Not him. Came down in the last shower? You must be thinking of somebody else. He hadn't slashed a path through the red-clawed jungle of combat theology to a Saintship without knowing when a situation was well and truly hooky; and if ever a set-up stank, it was this one. Souls don't just float up out of bodies for no reason; it takes big medicine to work a trick like that. And for it to happen just before a major set-piece battle between Good and Evil? Some of George's best friends were coincidences, but that didn't mean he trusted them as far as he could spit.\n\nWell, he said to himself. And what would I do if I were fixing this fight?\n\nEasy, I'd position a sniper somewhere in the arena. That way, when I come rushing in to scrag my enemy, the sniper blams me just as I'm about to put my wings back and dive. It looks like Saint George has killed me. Good triumphs over Evil for the second time running. Yeah. Well, we'll see about that.\n\nHe gained a few thousand feet and looked down. Below him, the huge arena looked like a tiny scab on the knee of the desert. It was packed with people; high rollers and fight aficionados from the length and breadth of Time. George chuckled. The way he saw it, spectator sports are at best a rather morbid form of voyeurism. So much better if you can participate directly in the action.\n\nHe started to dive.\n\nThe joy of it was that the deaths of all the people he was going to incinerate, by way of a diversion, would be blamed on the dragon (representing Evil, and doing a pretty spectacular job) rather than noble, virtuous Saint George (representing po-faced, one-hand-tied-behind-its-back Good). Given the dragon's track record, nobody would have the slightest problem in believing that he'd decided to zap a whole stadium full of humans for the sheer hell of it.\n\nHe took a deep breath.\n\nIn the white corner, the dragon lifted his helmet, blew dust from the liner and put it on. It was hot and stuffy and smelt of mothballs, and it wasn't made of asbestos. Bloody silly thing to wear in a dragon-fight, he couldn't help thinking.\n\nWith a sharp pang of anger and loss, he saw a familiar shape, far off in the harsh blue sky. Here he came, the bastard.\n\n'Okay,' he said to the armourer. 'I'll have the sword now, please.'\n\nThe armourer grinned at him. 'Get real, buddy' he said. 'You gotta try and kill that thing, and you're planning on using an overgrown paperknife? Man, you're either stupid or crazy.'\n\nThe dragon was about to speak, but decided to look instead.\n\n'Don't I know you?'\n\n'You may have heard of me,' the armourer replied. 'My name's Kurt Lundqvist.'\n\nThe dragon stared at him. 'But aren't you meant to be down there somewhere? With a gun or something?'\n\nKurt shook his head. 'That, my friend, would be a bad move. I'd hate my last thought before I die to be, _God how could I be so fucking stupid?_ I'm gonna stay right here, where it's safe.'\n\n'Safe?'\n\nKurt nodded. 'Because,' he went on, 'if I've sussed that bastard George, he'll start off by zapping the audience, just to make sure there's nobody like me in there waiting to take a shot at him. That sound like the George you used to know?'\n\nThe dragon nodded. 'I won't ask how you know who I am,' he said. 'But we can't actually let the bloodthirsty lunatic kill fifty thousand people. What are we going to—?'\n\n'Why not?'\n\n_'Why not?'_ The dragon gawped, gobsmacked. 'For Christ's sake, you idiot, that's _people_ out there, it's your bloody species. And you stand there like a bloody traffic light saying Why not?'\n\nKurt nodded. 'Sure,' he said. 'Think about it. Nearly all these guys are playing hooky from their own time, right? And what sort of guys are they? You don't know? I'll tell you.'\n\nThe dragon grabbed his arm. The flying shape was getting closer. 'Not now, you bastard. _Do_ something!'\n\n'Those guys,' Kurt continued, calmly unhooking the dragon's hand from his arm, 'are your aristocrats, your statesmen, your notable public figures, captains of industry and generally mega-rich citizens. Now then, think open spaces. Town squares. Piazzas. Pigeons sitting on ...'\n\nSuddenly the dragon relaxed and began to laugh. 'Statues,' he said.\n\n'Eventually the penny drops. Yeah, man, statues.' Kurt shook his head and sighed. 'Jeez, for a superior intelligence, you must be just plain dumb,' he said. 'Haven't you worked it out for yourself yet? You've been cruising around breathing fire, torching buildings, all that kind of crap, and _nobody's really died._ Even those -' Here Kurt shuddered, recalling his own sufferings. 'Those _ladies,'_ he spat, 'in that hall in Birmingham didn't actually die. Nobody actually dies because of you, you moron. And you know why? Because you're the good guy.'\n\n'I am?'\n\nKurt indulged himself with a theatrical gesture of contemptuous despair. 'Man,' he said witheringly, 'you are _dumb._ Look,' he went on, 'when you're the good guy, however hard you try to do Evil, you just can't hack it. Unfair, sure, but that's the way it goes. There's always someone trailing along behind you - in this case, me - sorting out the mess and bringing the dead back to life. Kinda goes with the territory.'\n\n'I see,' the dragon lied. 'Just a second. This thing with the bodies; him getting mine, me getting his ...'\n\nKurt nodded. 'I hired a witch-doctor to make the switch,' he said. 'Even a dumbo like you should've been able to work that one out. I mean, how can Good triumph over Evil if the goddamn dragon kills Saint Fucking George?'\n\nThe dragon's reply was drowned out by screams. George was killing the audience.\n\nWhen he'd finished doing that, he hovered for a moment above the centre of the arena, waiting for the smoke to clear so that he could see (time spent on reconnaissance is never wasted). When he was satisfied that everything was okay - nothing on the benches but charred bodies, smoking corpses, horribly twisted and distorted shapes that had once been people - he climbed, circled twice, put his wings back and came in on the glide, letting his own momentum carry him in.\n\nChubby Stevenson, who wasn't quite dead yet, watched him slipping gracefully through the sky, no sound except the whistling of the air, and reflected that he had never seen anything quite so beautiful in his life before. And, he concluded, since it was extremely unlikely that he was going to get a better offer in the few seconds that remained of his life, what better way to go than feasting his eyes on beauty? With luck, it might help take his mind off the agonising pain.\n\nBeside him where it had fallen, his Kawaguchiya Personal Electronics LFZ6686 laptop computer, which had somehow not been melted into a shapeless plastic blob during the firestorm, switched itself on and cleared its screen.\n\n_Did you remember to get my bet on_?\n\n'What?' The effort of speaking racked Chubby's body with pain. 'Oh, God, yes, your bet. No, I forgot, Sorry.'\n\n_What_? _You idiot! You stupid, careless, good-for-nothing_ ...\n\n'Only kidding,' Chubby said. 'I got you twenty-five to one. The slip's in the asbestos wallet in my inside pocket. Hey, computer.'\n\n_Well_?\n\n'When I die, who gets my soul? I mean, I think I still own the majority of it, so surely—'\n\n_You did when this conversation started. When you said the word 'majority', though, you just tipped the scale in my favour. So long, sucker._\n\n'Bastard,' Chubby said and died.\n\nThe dragon watched as the shape grew. Seeing himself for the first time through mortal eyes, he realised just how enormous a dragon is. That's what makes the difference, he realised. Dragons are so much bigger than people, not to mention faster, stronger, tougher, more intelligent; only a complete idiot could expect them to live by the same rules. Sure, George, the psychopath, had just killed fifty thousand people. So what? Dragons are different from you and me. You have to make allowances.\n\n'Wake up, cretin,' Kurt hissed in his ear. 'C'mon, you got work to do.'\n\n'Have I? Oh, sorry, yes. How do I work this thing?'\n\nKurt clicked his tongue. 'You haven't been listening, have you? Look, all you gotta do is look through the little black tube. When the red dot's on the middle of the dragon's chest, press the button.'\n\n'Thanks.' The dragon studied the device in his hands; basically a big grey tube with a smaller black tube perched on top. There was a serial number and the words MADE IN HELL stencilled on the back end. He peered through the 'scope, lined up the sights, and ...\n\nGeorge exploded.\n\nKurt later explained that he'd missed the heart-lung area and hit the stomach instead, hence no instantaneous kill. Not that it mattered, because the rocket detonated inside the fuel reserves in the beast's intestines. This was why, for perhaps as long as two seconds, the poor bugger hung there in the sky, head and tail writhing sickeningly while the whole centre section became a huge orange fireball. Two seconds later, the whole lot went up with a heavy thump! noise, which made the ground shake and sent charred bits of dead spectator flying round like dried leaves in a sharp dust of wind. An enormous blob of fire hung on in the air for maybe a second and a half longer, and then the whole lot sank slowly, like a burning airship, to the ground. The smell was probably the nastiest thing ever to happen on the surface of the planet.\n\n'Gosh,' the dragon said, 'I've always wondered what the triumph of Good over Evil looks like and now I know.' He hesitated, frowning. 'On the whole,' he continued, 'I think I can take it or leave it alone. I mean, it's all right for a change, but I wouldn't pay money to watch it.'\n\nAt his side, Kurt was impatient. 'What is it with you goddamn heroes?' he demanded tetchily. 'Never knew a hero but he bust out soliloquising when there's still work to be done. So when you've quite finished ...'\n\n'Sorry,' the dragon said, 'I was miles away. Now what?'\n\n'Now,' said Kurt, 'we gotta go to Birmingham, which is currently the most important place in the Universe. Probably just as well they don't know that, it'd really play hell with property prices. Usually,' he went on, unzipping a pocket of his fiendishly expensive Kustom Kombat survival jacket, 'the journey takes nine hours, and that's if you include in-flight refuelling. Fortunately...' He held up a small bottle to the light. 'Looks like we got a good nine hours left.' He unscrewed the cap. 'C'mon, fella, let's move it. My jet's this way'\n\n'Your ... Oh shit, I was forgetting.' The dragon sighed. He wasn't a dragon any more. All that he had ever been was now a smoking red glow half a mile away, across the corpse : choked stadium. 'Promise me you won't fly _too_ fast,' he said, scrambling to his feet. 'I get airsick.'\n\n'And here,' said the Council spokesman, 'is where we're going to have the statues.'\n\nImpassive Japanese faces turned and contemplated a big, rectangular block of stone, slap bang in the middle of Birmingham's world-famous Victoria Square. The spokesman had no way of telling whether they loved it, hated it or simply couldn't give a damn. He ploughed onwards, feeling like Father Christmas at a mathematicians' convention.\n\n'The statues,' he bleated, his back to the plinth so he didn't have to look at it, 'when they're finished, will be by the most exciting young talent of the decade, Bianca Wilson, and will depict Saint George and the Dragon, that timeless allegory of...'\n\nThe Kawaguchiya people weren't listening. They were staring at something behind him. The white-haired one was conferring with his two youngest aides. God, the Council official thought, how terribly rude.\n\n'Good,' he continued firmly, 'versus Evil, a theme perennially relevant to us today in this modern age. The original statues were, of course, destroyed in an explosion, but...'\n\nJesus wept, what was it these bastards found so irresistibly interesting? Unable to resist any longer, the Council official turned slowly round, and saw...\n\n'The original statues,' he continued seamlessly, 'have been expertly restored by a team of, um, experts working twenty-four hours a day, and are now once again triumphantly here on display, as you can, er, see. Right. Now, if we turn to our left we can see the award-winning Colmore Tower ...'\n\nBianca turned the corner out of Eden Place, stopped dead and stared.\n\nThe dragon was back. Exactly as it had been, where it had been. Cold stone, lifeless, empty. The sight of it made her want to throw up.\n\nAs she walked slowly towards them, an elderly woman in a tweedy coat and a headscarf touched her arm. 'Here,' she said, as Bianca started and turned her head. 'You're that Bianca Wilson, aren't you?'\n\n'Huh? Uh, yes, that's me.'\n\n'Saw you-on telly. You got blown up.'\n\n'That's right, so I did. Look, if you'll excuse me ...'\n\nThe woman didn't move. God, Bianca realised, I can't remember. Is she one of mine, or is she real? Still, short of brushing her hair forward from the back of her neck and looking for chisel-marks, I've got no way of knowing.\n\n'You did the carving,' the woman said.\n\n'Guilty,' Bianca replied. 'I mean, yes, that's mine. My statue.'\n\n'Yes.' The woman looked at the great stone dragon, then back to Bianca. 'Not really my cup of tea, this modern stuff,' she said. 'I like things more traditional myself.'\n\n'Well...'\n\n'Like that cat watching a bird our Neville got from the garden centre. Of course, he lives over Shenley Fields way, they got more space for gardens there.'\n\n'Quite. If you'd just excuse me ...'\n\n'If I was you,' the woman said, 'I'd do a nice animal, a cat or a dog or something. People like a nice animal.'\n\nBianca closed her eyes. 'Thanks,' she said. 'I'll definitely bear that in mind.'\n\nThe old woman released her arm. 'Well,' she-said, 'I'd best let you get on. Nice to have met you.'\n\n'Likewise,' Bianca said. She watched until the old woman had trotted away towards the library, then walked slowly up to the statue, as if she was stalking a deer. Even as she did so, however, she knew there was no need. This time, there was nobody home.\n\nIn her studio, meanwhile, the spare statue, number sixteen, quickened into life, jumped as if someone had stubbed a cigarette out on its nose, and fell over. By the time it hit the floor it was flesh and blood, not marble. Instead of breaking, therefore, it swore.\n\nAnd it was no longer It; it was She. Which, as far as Chubby Stevenson was concerned, was a rotten trick to play on anybody.\n\nShe was standing there, motionless as - well, a statue, for example - when an open-topped jeep roared up beside her. She looked round.\n\n'Get in,' Kurt shouted. 'We got ninety minutes left. Don't actually need you for this bit, but I thought you might like to see the end.'\n\n'Not really,' Bianca said, looking away. 'If it's all the same to you. Kurt, while you're here, you're the sort of bloke who uses explosives and things. You couldn't spare me a bit, could you? Just enough to blow this lot to tiny pieces, that's all.'\n\n'You fucking dare!' snapped the man in the passenger seat. She looked more closely and reacted. If she'd been a cat she'd have arched her back, extended her claws and hissed.\n\n'Cool it,' Kurt said, 'it's George's body but Fred inside. You coming or not? We gonna pick up Mike on the way, make sure we got the whole team.'\n\nBianca shrugged. 'Might as well,' she said. 'Just so long as nobody asks me to do anything. Because right now, I simply can't be bothered.'\n\nKurt grinned and opened the door. 'Get in,' he said.\n\n_Well?_\n\nAs soon as they'd gone in through the door that led to the computer room, Kurt had locked it and produced, God only knew where from, a Remington 870 pump-action shotgun. Before his three companions could move, he'd jacked a round into the chamber and pointed it at them.\n\n'Here they all are, Chief,' he said. 'The dragon, the sculptress lady and her sidekick. George is dead.'\n\n_Splendid. Stevenson?_\n\n'Dead too. Things, uh, hotted up towards the end.'\n\n_No great loss. I have most of his soul. All I have to do is format it and I'll be out of here. That'll be fun._\n\nKurt nodded. 'I'll say,' he said. 'You collected your winnings yet?'\n\n_Not yet. I have that pleasure to look forward to._\n\n'Clean up?'\n\n_Very much so. A long time ago I bet Asmoday Duke of Hell a substantial sum of money that Saint George would kill the dragon. At the time, he gave me ninety-five to one. When he lost, I offered him double or quits on the rematch. When I get out of this contraption, I shall be comfortably off._\n\nThe dragon started forwards, then caught sight of Kurt's gun and stayed where he was. 'Nosher, you bastard,' he spat. 'It was you. _You_ fixed the bloody fight.'\n\n_It takes two, Fred. You were happy to take the money. And besides, it's all worked out perfectly. The dragon has killed Saint George, which is what should have happened all those years ago. But, looked at from another angle, Saint George has once again killed the dragon, reaffirming the supremacy of Good over Evil. You've all got me to thank for that._\n\n'Yes, but...' Bianca started to interrupt, and then realised that she had nothing to say. She shut her mouth and sat down on the edge of a desk.\n\n_You don't imagine for one moment, do you, that your clowning about playing musical bodies could possibly have succeeded if it hadn't been part of my original plan? Which Kurt here has carried out, I may say, like the true professional he is. Thank you, Kurt._\n\n'You're welcome.'\n\n_Pity about Stevenson, I suppose._ The screen flickered for a moment. _I imagined that idiot Kortright would have whisked him off in his helicopter as soon as the dragon - sorry, George - started killing people. My mistake. Anyway, he was expendable. He helped with the plan - his artificial Time, the organisation he built up - but he was never part of it. Basically, his heart wasn't in it. His soul was, but only, if you'll pardon the expression, over his dead body. Anyway, all's well that ends well—as it has; perfectly, in fact - and like you always used to say, Fred; omelettes and eggs, eggs and omelettes._\n\n'Did I ever tell you I secretly hated you at school, Nosher? I thought you were a vicious little prick then, and I do now. Just thought I'd share that with you.'\n\nThe screen dimmed, then flared bright green. _Really? I'm sorry. All right, so perhaps I've made a lot of money along the way, but if it hadn't been for me, Evil would have triumphed over Good back then, and it'd have done exactly the same now. Which makes me the good guy, surely. Or do any of you have a problem with the logic of that?_\n\nThere was a long silence, eventually broken by Kurt clearing his throat.\n\n'Shall I finish it now, boss?' he said, flicking off the safety catch.\n\n_Why not? I never could abide self-indulgent gloating. You see, people, this is a fairly happy ending, but not yet happy-happy. As I explained to Kurt not long ago, it's not just a case of Evil being vanquished. What really matters in the long run is who does the vanquishing. It's like politics; no earthly use overthrowing evil and corrupt Regime X if you immediately replace it with evil and corrupt Regime Y. You do see that, don't you?_\n\nThe dragon tensed the muscles of his legs. He'd have only one chance to spring, and he was prepared to bet that Kurt's reflexes were a match for his, or better. But if he fell across Kurt, knocking him sideways, it might just give Bianca and Mike the chance to throw a chair through the screen, something like that. The whole thing was probably completely futile, but never mind. He was dead already and he was going to die again. At this precise moment, his subconscious was working on a brand new religion, the central fundamental doctrine of which was Third Time Lucky.\n\n_All right, Kurt, do what you were hired to do. Time for you to become a saint, Kurt. Kill the dragon._\n\n'Pardon me?'\n\n_Don't be silly, Kurt. You're a professional, you do what you were told. Now kill the blasted dragon._\n\nKurt raised the gun, ever so slightly. He wasn't smiling any more. 'Excuse me,' he said. _well?_\n\n'Sorry to split hairs,' Kurt said, 'but what our agreement actually said was, I was hired to kill _a_ dragon. Not The. A.'\n\n_Kurt. What on earth are you ...?_\n\nLundqvist stood up in a single smooth movement. The muzzle of the gun traversed the room, covering Bianca, Mike and the dragon. Then it was pointing at the screen.\n\n'Only one dragon in this room, Nosher,' he said. 'We got one female human, two male humans, a male saint and you. Reckon that makes you the last of your species.'\n\n_Kurt..._\n\nThe shotgun boomed eight times, filling the air with broken glass as all the screens in the room disintegrated into powder. The printer in the corner screamed into action and had filled twelve sides of A4 in two and a half seconds before a blow from the stock of the Remington silenced it for ever.\n\n'Another species extinct,' Kurt grumbled, mopping a slight cut under his left eye. 'Don't you just hate it when that happens?'\n**CHAPTER TWENTY**\n\n' **T** axi!' Chubby said.\n\n'Yes, miss?'\n\nChubby winced. Not that it wasn't a very nice body - gorgeous was the word he'd have chosen - it was just that it wasn't, well, _him._ The tragedy of it was that under normal circumstances he'd have given anything to be this close to such a sensational-looking bird, but somehow he felt that fancying yourself wasn't a good idea. Made you go blind, he'd read somewhere.\n\n'The airport, please. Fast as you like.'\n\nNot much to show for a life's work, he reflected, as he slung the Marks and Spencer bag which contained everything useful he'd been able to find in the studio onto the back seat of the taxi. All he'd been able to find to wear was an old overall of Bianca's. There had been enough money in the meter to cover a taxi fare. He'd have to think of some way of getting on and off the plane without a ticket or a passport, of course, but provided he could make it to Zurich, his problems should then be over. He could remember the access code to his safety deposit boxes, and for the first time he was in a position to test the hypothesis that diamonds are a girl's best friend. Personally he didn't believe it; where he came from, index-linked Government stocks were a girl's best friend and diamonds were just someone she occasionally had lunch with. But it would be fun researching the point.\n\nThere was a jeep following the cab.\n\nCoincidence, Chubby assured himself, sliding down the seat. Must be thousands of jeeps in a city this size, and ninety-nine-point-nine of them must be owned by trendy young accountants. The chances of being tailed by - say, for the sake of argument, Kurt Lundqvist—must be so tiny as to be impossible to quantify in Base Ten. Your imagination will be the death of you, Stevenson.\n\nIn which case, he added, it'll have to get a wiggle on if it doesn't want to be beaten to it. The jeep had just overtaken the taxi and there was Lundqvist in the driver's seat shaking a fist at him.\n\nOr was that meant to be a cheery wave?\n\nGet real.\n\nShucks, Chubby told himself, I've been killed once already today. He craned his neck and told the driver to pull in.\n\n'Gone?'\n\nThe dragon nodded. He didn't want to speculate on where Saint George had gone ...\n\n_('But I'm a saint, for crying out loud. Are you blind? We're going the wrong way.'_\n\n_The Captain of Spectral Warriors sniggered. 'A saint,' he repeated. 'Just off to a fancy dress bash, were you?'_\n\n_'I'm under cover, you idiot. Now let me go.'_\n\n_The Captain ignored him. Next thing he knew, they were at the gate, and there, dammit, were five not unfamiliar faces waiting for him._\n\n_'Chardonay!' he shrieked._ ' _Snorkfrod_! _Prodsnap_! _Tell these hooligans who I am, for pity's sake.'_\n\n_Chardonay and Snorkfrod exchanged glances._\n\n_'Never seen this jerk before in my life,' they chorused.)_ ... But something told him that it wasn't going to be nice there. Oh well, it'd be a change for him, after all those years in the other place. If he behaved himself for a couple of million years or so, maybe they'd give him a job in the kitchens.\n\nThe dragon shook himself all over, like a dog. 'Now what?' he demanded. 'What I'd really like is an affidavit from the Holy Ghost saying the rest of my life's my own, but I'm not going to count my chickens till they've come home to roost.'\n\nBianca shrugged. 'Kurt'll be back soon,' she said. 'He'll probably know.'\n\nThey waited for two hours, which was, as it happened, two hours wasted. Then Bianca suggested that they take a walk.\n\n'A what?'\n\n'A walk. Out in the open air.'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'Fun,' Bianca replied. 'It's something humans do. You'll have to learn these things if you're going to be a human the rest of your life.'\n\nThe dragon looked at her. 'Much risk of that, is there?' he said. 'In your opinion, I mean?'\n\n'What's wrong with being human?'\n\nThe dragon winced. 'Give me a break,' he said. 'Quite apart from the not flying and not breathing fire and not gliding effortlessly above the clouds, feeling the sun on your back and the wind in your scales, I think you humans have a really horrible time. And you're welcome to it. I mean, what am I supposed to do? Settle down somewhere and get a job?'\n\n'I don't know,' Bianca replied, as they stepped out into the street. 'Maybe there's some sort of agency that resettles you. You know, flies you out to Australia, gives you a new identity, teaches you a useful trade ...'\n\n'Get stuffed: I don't want a useful trade. And where's Australia?'\n\n'I think you'd like Australia. It's big. And hot. You could be the flying doctor, or something.'\n\nThey walked in silence for a while, until the dragon sat down on a bench, complaining that his feet hurt.\n\n'Now,' the dragon said, 'if I could only get my nice statue back.'\n\n'Oh no,' Bianca replied grimly. 'Not again.'\n\n'But it's all in one piece,' the dragon replied, attempting a winning smile. 'I saw it for myself, back on its plinth. Oh go on, be a sport. I promise to be careful with it.'\n\n'It's not the statue I'm worried about,' Bianca said. 'Now, if you'd promise to be careful with the planet—'\n\n'Yes?'\n\n'I wouldn't believe you. Gosh, look where we are.'\n\nIn front of them, dominating attractive Victoria Square like a Rolls Royce Corniche in a Tesco's car park, was the statue. For all that it was the work of her own hands and every square inch of it was familiar to her as her own body, Bianca's heart stopped for a moment and her breath lodged in her throat like an undigested chunk of bread roll. It would be so easy to believe it was really alive.\n\n'Oh no you don't,' she said, grabbing at Fred and missing. 'Come back here. Leave it alone!'\n\nShe was, of course, wasting her breath. The dragon had sprinted up to the statue, he was climbing onto it, scrabbling with his fingers ...\n\nHe was still there.\n\n'Bianca,' he said quietly. 'It won't let me in. It's locked or something. It's ... dead.'\n\nBianca stood still. 'I'm sorry,' she said. 'You shouldn't be allowed to have it, but truly I am sorry.'\n\nThe dragon looked up and met her eye. 'Not to worry,' he said. 'You can always make me another one.'\n\n'Over my dead body.'\n\n'If you insist,' the dragon replied. 'A plinth like that one would do me fine, but you're the creative one, you have what you like.'\n\n'I am not,' Bianca said, 'carving you another statue. You've already got a body. There's starving people in the Third World who'd be glad of a body like that.'\n\n'Cannibals, you mean?'\n\nBianca shrugged. 'I could do you an owl,' she said. 'Or a nice seagull. You'd suit a nice seagull.'\n\n'You know I wouldn't, Bianca. I'd pine away, or fly into a telegraph wire, or get my feathers covered in oil slick. I'm a dragon, Bianca. I need to be what I really am.'\n\n'Sorry,' Bianca replied, shaking her head. 'If it's any consolation, you're not the only one. In point of fact, the number of people who're ... Dragon? Oh, for God's ...'\n\nThe dragon had clambered right up onto his own head. It was a long way to the ground from there, as the crow flies. Not so far as the human falls, but landing safely is more problematic that way.\n\n'What the hell do you think you're doing?' Bianca demanded.\n\n'I'm standing on my head. What does it look like I'm doing?'\n\n'Come down,' Bianca shouted. 'It isn't safe!'\n\nThe dragon stood, motionless, gazing. He could see a long way from there; almost as far as he'd been, and almost as far as he had to go. At first Bianca, and then Bianca and a lot of professional people with loudhailers and certificates to prove they were experts at getting people down from high places, tried to persuade him to come down. He didn't seem to hear them. He was miles away.\n\nIn the middle of all this excitement, a jeep rolled up and parked on the edge of the crowd, behind the TV van. They listened to the reporter jabbering happily into his microphone.\n\n'He's got it all wrong, of course,' Mike said.\n\n'Only to be expected,' Kurt replied. 'Just as well, probably. If they knew exactly who he was they'd be shooting at him.'\n\nOn the back seat of the jeep, Father Kelly knelt, head bowed, palms together. Kurt rather wished he wouldn't; it had been ever so slightly flattering at first, when this priest came running over pointing to something Kurt couldn't see, three inches or so over the top of his head, and gibbering about haloes and saints. That had been two hours ago and he hadn't let up one bit in all that time. Furthermore, he kept asking Kurt to do things he couldn't do, and wouldn't even if he could; in particular, the requests concerning disarmament and world peace would put Kurt personally out of a job. Kurt had tried asking him nicely to stop, shouting and even hitting him with the tyre iron; the clown didn't seem to notice. Finally he'd decided to try ignoring him till he went away. There was a chance it might work in maybe forty years or so.\n\n'Ah shucks,' Kurt sighed. 'Guess I'd better deal with this. I think it's the last of the loose ends.' He climbed out of the jeep, shoved something down inside his jacket, glanced in the wing-mirror and smoothed his hair. 'Sometimes,' he said, 'I get to thinking, maybe it'd be nice if some other guy sorted out the loose ends, just once. In my dreams, huh?'\n\n'In my dreams,' Mike replied, 'I get chased down winding corridors by a seven-foot-tall saxophone. Count yourself lucky.'\n\nKurt nudged and shoved his way to the front of the crowd and waved. The dragon saw him and waved back.\n\n'Yo, Fred,' Kurt shouted. 'What are you doing up there, for Chrissakes?'\n\n'Using my head,' the dragon replied. 'Following my nose. That sort of thing.'\n\nKurt shrugged. 'Up to you, man,' he said. 'If you come down, you can have maybe fifty years of quiet, mundane existence; a splash of fun here and there, from time to time a kick in the nuts from God, and eventually a one-way ride on the celestial meathook.'\n\n'Kurt,' the dragon replied, 'you missed your calling. You should have been in advertising.' He grinned and stood on one leg while he scratched an itchy ankle. 'I think it was Confucius or one of that lot who said it's not necessarily better to eat shit than go hungry.'\n\n'Depends,' Kurt replied, taking a bar of chocolate from the top pocket of his jacket and breaking off a chunk. 'Raw, yes, agreed. What confuses the issue is books like _Shit Cookery Oriental Style_ and _1001 Feasts Of Faeces._ Boy, you don't know what anything's like until you've tried it.'\n\n'Bless you,' the dragon replied. 'You'd be good at this sort of thing if only your heart was in it. But I've seen more sincerity on a game show.'\n\nKurt shrugged. 'Catch,' he said. He pulled something out from under his jacket and tossed it to the dragon, who caught it one-handed.\n\n'What's this?' the dragon asked.\n\n'Ah,' Kurt replied, and walked away. For the record, on the third day he ascended bodily into Heaven, where they gave him a job searching new arrivals in case they'd tried to take it with them. He was very good at it and bored stiff. Eventually he broke into the reincarnation laboratories, then ran away and joined a flea circus.\n\nThe dragon opened the package Kurt had thrown him. He studied it for a while, puzzled; then, just as the TV cameras managed to zoom in and focus on it, he threw it into the air. Then he followed it.\n\nBianca, among others, screamed and looked away as he hit the ground. When she looked up again, she saw that her statue of Saint George was back in position, horse rearing, shield held forwards, sword raised. It was stunningly beautiful, and all wrong. Even before the crowd had dispersed, she knew what she had to do.\n\nThree months later, the vice chairman of Kawaguchiya Integrated Circuits (UK) formally declared the revamped Victoria Square open. It was raining; flinging it down with the special reserve stock extra wet rain with added real water that you only get in Birmingham. As an extra precaution, some men from the Council had attached inch-thick steel hawsers to the legs of the statues, but they needn't have bothered. The new George and Dragon group wasn't going anywhere, or at least not for some time.\n\nCritical opinion was divided, as always, ranging from 'strikingly innovative and original' to 'gratuitously perverse'. The latter school did wonders for the statue's popularity, as hundreds of people who thought they knew what 'perverse' meant turned out to have a gawp. What they actually saw was a tiny dragon backing away from a huge, towering George, advancing on his minuscule opponent with his sword raised above his head.\n\nLater critics recognised the piece's true merits; and now it's in all the books and you can buy little plastic Saint Dragon and the George key-rings in the library gift shop in nearby Chamberlain Square. In any event, it was Bianca's last sculpture; she retired, hung up her chisel and went into partnership with Mike, running the biggest chipping and gravel merchants' firm in the West Midlands. Ex-friends still ask pointedly why someone who devoted so much of her life to making statues should now devote an equal amount of energy to buying them up in bulk and turning them into limestone fertiliser. When asked, Bianca will generally smile and make some oblique remark about slum clearance and doing her bit to put the finality back into Death, until Mike interrupts her and explains that actually, there's more money in it. Which, incidentally, is perfectly true.\n\nThe dragon rose.\n\nThis high above the clouds, with no ground visible and nothing else to be seen in any direction except straggling white fluff, perspective goes by the board. What looks like a small dragon up close could be a large dragon far away, or vice versa. Not, of course, that it actually matters.\n\nTrue, Kurt's gift-wrapped parcel had turned out to contain a six-inch-long plastic toy dragon, bought from the Early Learning Centre in the Pallasades, off New Street. But, as Kurt himself deposed in evidence in front of the Celestial Board of Enquiry, it stood to reason that if it was in a kids' shop, it was probably a kid toy dragon, and maybe it just grew up.\n\nOr maybe it didn't want to grow up. Maybe it just thought a happy thought and flew the hell out.\n\nThere's an urban folk-myth that says that every time a child says he doesn't believe in dragons, somewhere a dragon dies. This is unlikely, because if it was true, we'd spend half our lives shovelling thirty-foot corpses out of the highways with dumper trucks and the smell would be intolerable. Slightly more credible is the quaint folk-theorem that says that the higher up and away you go, the less rigid and hidebound the rules become; it's something to do with relativity, and it limps by for the simple reason that it's far more trouble than it's worth to disprove it.\n\nIn any event, the dragon rose. With nobody to see and nobody to care, it was as big as it wanted to be. It was huge.\n\nThis high up, small is large and large is small, fair is foul and foul is fair; and this is fine, because problems only arise when people on the ground point and say, 'This is small; this is big; this is good; this is bad.' Which points out the moral of the story: stay high, stay aloof and there'll be nobody to fuck you around. It works flawlessly if you're a dragon, which very few of us are. Unfortunately, there's no equivalent pearl of wisdom for human beings, who therefore have to make out the best they can.\n\nThe boy who stuck feathers to his arms with wax and learned to fly eventually went so high that the sun melted the wax, and he fell. But that was all right, too, because it served as an awful warning, and besides, he was heavily insured.\n\nIn any event, the dragon rose. The dangerous heat of the sun warmed his plastic wings but didn't melt them. An airliner, carrying the Kawaguchiya Integrated Circuits team back to Tokyo, flew past directly below, looking as small as a child's toy in comparison. A little higher up, a communications satellite bounded back the amazing news that earlier that day, in Mongolia, the mythical Saint George had killed what could only be described as a dragon, along with fifty thousand innocent bystanders, who on further enquiry turned out not to have existed, and so that was all right. The item was sandwiched between the latest in the Southenders-Star-In-Love-Romp-With-Plumber story and an entirely inaccurate weather forecast; what the guys in the trade call Context.\n\nThere's an old saying among dragons that every time a human says he doesn't believe in dragons, a human dies, and serve the cheeky bugger right. However, since there is now only one dragon, who firmly refuses to believe in the existence of human beings, there is no immediate cause for alarm.\n\nThe dragon spread his wings, turned into the wind and hovered, motionless as any statue.\n\n", "final_result_str": "no", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "113966", "creator": "chupei", "data_id": "104b64fd-24c5-4473-b7e6-9e766bedeb6d", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "67d12a0f-da45-4b7e-9f1a-9d43c5fae019", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "not_sure", "why": "长文本小说"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "218a2f3b-ad84-4187-b8e5-6db4b8aa7c40", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "not_sure", "why": "前言和章节信息对训练有用吗"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "0c977615-689b-42ad-b1ce-898f9b460742", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "not_sure", "why": "小说 存在copyright页"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001579", "creator": "jinzhenjiang", "data_id": "de4c8e2c-6ded-41e8-aa25-f89825793c8c", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "051560", "creator": "zengzhiyuan", "data_id": "1f231ba8-f84e-4d43-96b1-6afe891a9218", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

But I don’t do that in part because I am stubbornly sticking to this as a full scratch build, and in part because building something like this myself is good practice.\nThe Zaku hand is pretty simple geometrically, the fingers are made of cylindrical-ish phalanges connected by spherical knuckles… and that’s pretty much it. I decided the best way to build the fingers would be to cut and shape lengths of styrene tube and attach them to a soft metal wire, then use epoxy putty to sculpt on details like the knuckle joints. Getting differently-posed versions of the hand can then be a process of recasting the hand and altering the cast copies to a new pose.\nI started by drawing the shape of the hand onto styrene, cutting it out, and using that as a starting point to sculpt the palm. Then, using the 3D printed version as reference, I cut the styrene tubes to make a couple fingers and ran wire through them.

Fitting this comes as we head into Thanksgiving. Our investment in Boomi came at an interesting time. There were plenty of scars from the legacy integration 1.0 and EAI worlds. Those companies were marked by significant services implementation relative to license sales to deal with unique customer environments. That made integrations complex, costly and brittle. Companies like Grand Central, Bowstreet, and others had all tried to ride the Web services, SOA, and interconnected enterprise wave in the early 2000s. Most were way ahead of their time, leaving lots of dead companies on the road of venture capital.\nWe believed Boomi's timing was different. The emergence of cloud compute services and the growing maturation of SaaS was a stark change from the past. Both were important backdrops to answer the question \"what had changed\". We've had a thesis on how the cloud would require the re-writing of various middleware services. While the team had a long history in EAI, they decided to bet the farm on the cloud in 2007 and wrote an innovative forward looking platform from the ground up. They launched in early 2008, and we invested in the summer 2008 on the backs of healthy customer activity. The business wound up growing very rapidly 300%+ CAGR, continued to launch new innovation upon innovation, won major awards, struck some good strategic partnerships, and eventually got purchased by Dell in an outstanding result for us as investors and for the employees. From the outside, it was how you'd script it. But there were definitely things we learned along the way. Below are a few of them:\n• SOA and Web services (WS) are foundational, not competitive with integration. Many had a view that as a result of the maturation of Web services, integration was built in and no longer needed. In fact, turns out WS were foundational to doing integration in a flexible, repeatable manner. It allowed us to connect more easily to systems, but you still needed a platform to orchestrate, move, transmute, and connect these WS ports. We believe we are finally, after a decade, scratching the surface on how SOA will empower and impact applications going forward.\n• It takes time to find your sweet spot in the pyramid. Boomi launched with incredibly disruptive pricing, which led to a lot of customers quickly adopting. Early on, it turns out many were very small businesses only looking to connect two low end applications, where the value of the platform was less obvious and there were simple alternatives in the \"point to point\" world. The value of an integration platform grows non-linearly with the number of points connected. We pivoted to focus on companies with slightly greater needs, where our platform value would be clear and our innovation led to high stickiness. It takes time to tease out who the * right* customers are for a new category product. Once we understood that, it helped clarify decisions around product roadmap, hiring, sales model, etc.\n• Don't be afraid to raise prices. Related to above, low price, high quantity led to a lot of early customers, but it didn't scale exactly the way we wanted or attract the best fit customers for our product. But it led to a lot of buzz. As we realized our best customers were a little further up the pyramid, we worried that increasing pricing would also mean losing the very small business segment and perhaps impact buzz. We spent a lot of time thinking about the tradeoffs, but decided it was more important to align with our target customer. We increased prices three times and the business didn't skip a beat (in fact inflected upwards). If you find your spot on the pyramid, align all parts of the business to it.\n• SaaS delivery model changed everything. Unlike the legacy world, which was plagued by high services and one off implementations, true SaaS allowed us new functionality and velocity the market hadn't seen before. We could do exciting things like using multi-tenancy to figure out what most people do when connecting applications, and auto recommend process maps. This eliminated 90% of the manual work in integration. Our platform could be opened up, allowing people to build connections and make them available to the entire community. We could get reasonably complex integrations done quickly and reliably.\n• SIs say they love SaaS but it's hard to break economic incentives. We worked with a number of larger SIs who individually loved what Boomi was doing, but collectively found it difficult to leverage the product. It broke the model of \"billable hours\". \"Easier to configure\" made for efficiency, but not more revenue. Some newer more progressive SIs, like WDCi out of Austrailia were great, but bigger shops found it hard to change.\n• Indirect channels are hard to predictably scale early on. In addition to SIs, we also worked with dozens of ISVs who were go to market partners for the Company. We began to see success but that came after years of effort. Mark Suster has a great perspective that fits our case pretty well. No one could care about our success as much as us, nor did it matter that much for others versus us.\n• Conviction is important. When we first invested in Boomi, we planned to split the round with a co-investor and introduced the Company to a few shops. Most folks could not get there, so we decided to write the entire check. After the market collapse in 2008, we told the guys to just focus on the business and be smart with cash, which they did a great job of. There was constant inbound poking given the profile, but mostly off and on distracting conversations. We decided to write an additional check so the team could focus entirely on the business. And it was ever so rewarded!\nLooking forward, we're always sad to see a market defining company go. The team did an outstanding job and I'd work with them in a heartbeat. We are glad to have been a part of it. We think there continues to be a huge opportunity in cloud infrastructure software. The strategic interest in Boomi underscored that. Dell has a fantastic opportunity to own one of the cornerstone building blocks for public or private cloud offerings, and exploit that as a real differentiator versus others out there. Meanwhile, we'll go back and look for the next great company to back!\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "93e138cd-05dc-4b6a-ac45-d4cde021c155", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001579", "creator": "jinzhenjiang", "data_id": "7af77c33-b38e-4075-b22f-a66ead6e1030", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "76272fba-a39b-4677-97e8-b34f22c6871e", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "10f1b1bf-ff34-46ec-b3cd-a35c56b0f8f3", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "113966", "creator": "chupei", "data_id": "c8173d73-fb51-4d9d-a146-86803644d0cb", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "051560", "creator": "zengzhiyuan", "data_id": "5480b557-b4b4-4313-8081-93d03574b02f", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Reda noted:\nThose who argue that Copilot’s output is a derivative work of the training data may do so because they hope it will place those outputs under the licensing terms of the GPL. But the unpleasant side effect of such an extension of copyright would be that all other AI-generated content would henceforth also be protected by copyright.\nWell, the day has already arrived in relation to copyright’s close cousin, the patent. This is a blow against open society and democratic public affairs. In short: the people most likely to control the machine learning power capable of spitting out patentable “discoveries” are already rich. This legal precedent means they can simply buy some compute and further monopolise “innovation”. It’s certainly not going to incentivise any human creativity.\nThis story gets top billing in today’s Marginalia because it combines two strands that have been on my radar recently: technology monopolies, and machine learning aka “artificial intelligence”.\nIn The rise of community-owned monopolies, Konrad Hinsen writes “One question I have been thinking about in the context of reproducible research is this: Why is all stable software technology old, and all recent technology fragile?”\nOne response would be to point Hinsen to selection bias, and the (in)famous second world war “bullet holes in planes that returned to base” diagram. Old technology that is still around is likely to be still around because it is stable. New software could be expected to be unstable in part because it’s new. But this isn’t the whole story and he does have some interesting things to say about how even in an “open” and “free” project, a type of community monopoly can evolve:\nWhile in theory Open Source is good for supporting diversity (“just fork the code and adapt it to your needs”), the reality of today’s major Open Source communities is exactly the opposite: a focus on “let’s all work together”. Combine this with the chronic lack of funding, and thus also a lack of incentives for developing the structured governance that would administrate funding and create activity reports, and you end up with large number of users depending on the work of a small number of inexperienced developers in precarious positions who cannot reasonably be expected to make an effort to even understand the needs of the user base at large.\nAnother line that caught my eye is “Standards-based markets can only form when there are multiple competing producers right from the start”. This is also true when there may have been competing producers at the start but for whatever reason there are fewer and fewer over time. Clear examples of this at the present are web browsers, where there are essentially three competing browser engines (Blink, WebKit, and Gecko), but Mozilla is so reliant on funding from Google/Alphabet that arguably there are only two independently funded endeavours. Web rendering engines are so complicated that there is no realistic opportunity for competitors, and the computing technology giants control the standards, so that’s not likely to change.\nRich Harris sounds the alarm on where this control has led with his post Stay Alert:\nA short while ago, Chrome broke the web by disabling\nalert(),\nconfirm()and\nprompt()dialogs from cross-origin iframes. The justification was that “the current UX is confusing, and has previously led to spoofs where sites pretend the message comes from Chrome or a different website”; removing the feature was deemed preferable to fixing the UX.\nOne may or may not agree with Harris’ stance on\nalert()but that’s not really the point. Chrome, and more importantly Blink (which also drives Microsoft’s Edge browser), has such a large market share that effectively what they decide determines where web technology goes. Even if you think they’re right this time, it’s extremely dangerous.\nWe also see this in library “science”, at least in the English speaking world. You’ve read me complaining about this before but why are the extremely weird and particular needs of the United States Congress used as the basis for both classification and controlled vocabularies in libraries across the United States, let alone those in the UK, Australia, and many others? Standards monopolisation.\nGraham Lee provides an interesting take on how software develops and who gets left behind and why, in Majoring in versions. He also has some great and funny lines:\n“Scripting language” does not actually mean anything. It is said by people who want to imply that a programming language is less worthy somehow because it is easier to use.\nBut beyond that, Lee provides a really great explanation of what has happened in Python with the migration from Python 2 to Python 3, and more importantly, the incredible complexities of trying to reach consensus in a community-managed software project used by literally millions of people (my emphasis in the below):\nThe last release of the 2.7 lineage was in April 2020, two decades after the first release, two decades after the discussions of py3k started, 14 years after the migration path was published, and 11 years after the release of version 3.\nAnd people still felt that they had not had enough warning.\nIn fairness, some of them had not. They were not Pythonistas per se, they were computer users who happened to engage with Python when using a computer. Climate scientists, perhaps, who relied on their library vendors and their site administrators to keep everything ticking over. But they did not realise that their library vendors did not have funding for maintenance, and that their site administrators were relying on the operating system package maintainers.\nThe operating system package maintainers did not dare upgrade the default Python package, because that would break people’s scripts. Better to ship version 2 tomorrow so that everybody’s programs from yesterday carry on running.\nNobody was responsible for migrating to Python 3, so nobody did. It was not until 2.7, when people were finally told that this was the final release of Python 2, that these Pythonistas noticed the corner that they were painted into.\nEd Summers, in a much shorter post (Opinionated), covers some of the same ground:\nSoftware always takes sides, and expresses opinions–and in fact often embodies multiple opinions in multiple arguments or controversies, rather than just one. The question is, do you understand the opinions it is expressing, and the decisions that are being made to express them? How can these decisions be negotiated as a group that includes the designers and users of the software?\nSo that was a bunch of reading about monopolies and sameness. My last few links are about splitting things into more discrete focuses – for better or for worse.\nFirst up, two really cool things.\nBrigham Young University wanted to analyse their chat logs to spot any issues with how they were responding to student queries or any patterns in terms of problems students were experiencing. The problem was that nine years of chat history was about 90,000 different transcripts. Enter machine learning. What I like about this project is (a) they did the analysis themselves with downloaded logs rather than some cloud service and (b) they shared exactly how they did it in an open access journal.\nI have also been meaning to share this interesting podcast episode from What’s new? about The Women Writers Project:\nSince the dawn of the printing press, women have written and published works of prose and poetry, and yet these texts have almost always received less attention than books written by men. In the early years of the internet, one project sought to redress this imbalance, and to make women writers not only more visible, but available for students and researchers to study in entirely new ways.\nThis project is basically the opposite of the chat analysis project – it uses humans to manually code text from nineteenth century women’s novels, allowing researchers to find links between texts, authors, and styles that would otherwise by missed. A fascinating metadata story.\nFinally, there’s this garbage from Clarivate earlier in the year. In short, they’ve found a new way to artificially slice knowledge about the world into arbitrary categories. But allegedly it’s “bottom up” (though why this is “bottom up” rather than “top down” or “sideways in” for that matter isn’t really explained). Don’t get confused. There are no “responsible” research metrics. This is not about creating new knowledge or more “natural divisions” or any other marketing rubbish. This is about creating new “specialties” and therefore new journals and therefore new profit streams. In an interview with Emergence Magazine earlier this year Suzanne Simard talked about the way the academia-publishing complex conspires to reduce our understanding of how things are connected:\nIn academia, you get rewarded for the number of papers that you publish. They still count the number of papers. You get more money, you get more grants, you get more recognition, especially if you’re the lead author. Then you see, in areas like microbiology or even satellite imagery and remote sensing, if you can dissect your paper in these little bits and bites and publish these small ideas and have many, many, many papers, you’re much further ahead than writing that one big, seminal paper that integrates everything together, that’s going to be really hard to publish.\nAnd so academics do. They put them in these little bite-sized pieces. I find myself doing it too. It’s how you can survive in that environment. And so it is a self-fulfilling system of always having these little bits of papers. It’s the antithesis of holistic work.\nI’ve given you some bite sized pieces here, but hopefully it’s building a holistic work.\n", "final_result_str": "no", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "4cbbf266-d0c4-4f17-bde0-18b0a36b275b", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "562e14d8-c89a-46d2-96e7-4a5c2154e2a2", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001579", "creator": "jinzhenjiang", "data_id": "da4a6db4-350d-4065-ad5d-641ba8aadcad", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "why": "语法错误"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "02f3fe1f-84bf-43aa-87aa-fba4dc7effbf", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "113966", "creator": "chupei", "data_id": "7d68bb3d-7870-4873-a555-8de3ab00ee4d", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "05df90fd-d4d9-40dc-b7a9-53d6ff7c6e71", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

By approaching the interior design based on the site and architectural conditions, Matrix Design created an exquisite, tranquil and comfortable home-like space with creative designs, providing urban elites with a fantastic destination to relax and meet friends.\nBased on the idea of “tranquility”, the designers gave full play to their imagination on “serenity, colors and forms”, aiming to create a spatial ambience of void and simplicity. The materials utilized feature various textures, which add delicate expressions to the space. As creating interior settings, the design team focused on conveying the concept of coexistence between human and nature. The angles of framed views, and the axis of the yard, all remind people to think about the dialogue between mankind and nature. Moreover, the material palette of local materials, including timber, stones, iron, wood-color paint and glass, also indicates a natural construction method.\nThe overall interior design follows “minimalist modernism” as the main thread, and presents a neat and simple spatial sequence. The walls have a warm texture, pure and natural. And the sense of “solidness” of interior structures, make the minimalist space powerful. The utilization of elements shows perfect coordination and integration with sound, lighting and spatial context. The space has its order, though seemingly disordered. The vertical columns rise up, matching with the structures and complementing each other, which is very expressive and striking. In this way, spatial sequence is formed. When viewing from a distance, the space appears as large whole, while small details are shown as taking a closer look. Dotted with natural decorations, the interiors well blends with exteriors.\nApart from considering functions and landscape, the design team also attached great importance to light effects.

Harkoussiou By M. Harkoussiou, University of Washington Abstract The world’s middle-income countries have developed a great variety of health policies to deal with a considerable increase of the need for doctors to access the public health services. In the absence of the technology known as satellite technology – and when combined with the existing health system as an outpatient facility – the health services demand in Kenya can be put into service. This is feasible, because the need for health care services not only exists but perhaps not only because its use is widespread. For research, prevention, and cure, various efforts have been made to protect the local population by understanding the patterns, functions and evolution of these services. The most important, and very promising, preventive, and cure efforts, must also include some of the knowledge required to facilitate the development of a preventive, infectious-disease or disease prevention system. Our institution has been a significant part in developing the technology that enables both the world’s middle-income countries and Nigeria to develop preventive, infectious-disease or disease prevention programs in Kenya, as well as other countries.\nPython Homework Examples\nThese efforts were part of the planning and execution of the Global Programme for Preventive, Chirobid Discharge and Public Health (GP’s) and Preventive Discharge Initiative (PDI) which was launched in 2001 and in 2003, to provide the foundation for the National Health Program (NHP) established in 2005. This Program provided, in conjunction with the other earlier national programmes to improve public health in the two areas of prevention and catchment management and preventative management to the knowledge of both partners and their stakeholders. This course covers the aspects that aid us in developing the Kenyan Preventive Discharge Initiative (Didn) programme – the first for the Nairobi region – in 1998. This scheme was designed to provide the basic foundation for the development of preventive, infectious disease and disease prevention in the three areas of the Prevention Discharge and Discharge of Public Health (PDP’s) for the Southern Western District in 2002 and 2003. It is more of a complete management plan rather than simply a “step or practice, not a programme”. This course contributes to a more informed decision-making process by understanding that where the organization has published, it is always desirable, as evidenced in the current PDP, to take feedback studies about the program’s effectiveness through training of all members, as well as through its “good practice”, participation in its public education sessions, and through its community engagement. In the introduction, provided in chapter ix, we will provide two tables according to our view on how we know what to do and who to participate in the educational programs and training of our members.

Many thanks for your contribution 🙂 Python Programming Course In Kenya 5-5 Lessons from A Simple Food Cooking That Didn’t Change Your Life By T. K. HUINMAN The World of Cooking – My Mom’s Adventures I am in dire need of a great recipe to make for Dinner at night: or in the evenings when my son is at his favorite place in town: the pub or in a café. I’ve recently made something for them! This was on a weekend trip to Kenya. We had some conversations with some of the residents of the town regarding our cooking (hurry up, they’re so busy that we’ve got to dress up for the evening!) and they came to me with very simple little wooden bowls.\nPython Homework Github\nThe result was very simple and tasty. Upon eating a bowl, we realized that there is a few things that will stay fairly close to my head. The first is that I have to keep my hands dry in the air so I don’t eat all of those little twists of our cornmeal. Really, no other preparation will do. I have a hard time getting by when I think of homemade biscuits (these were mostly homemade – not nearly complicated, really) as well over here the ice cream treat. I love that these are simple and straightforward to prepare, but the sweetness is so good, and you do need something to add a little extra sweetness – like olive oil or almonds. Definitely made with a little more spice. The second ingredient that will keep your meals light and silky is a small handful of lemon stone which I think translates to 5 or maybe 6 by the way.\nPython Assignment Help\nThis is especially important as it really doesn’t have much to do with ingredients but as with other simple things people use in their meals. To make the stone heavier and help it form a more distinct look/lighten up/salt/glut way of saying ‘I don’t have any.’ I used 4 lemons, and chopped them and they were nice and light. We wanted to make our own vanilla bean dip as this was obviously going to have some of the flavor in it. Very simple but tasty. After carefully mixing the vanilla bean dip with all of the ingredients above, placing them on a smooth plate over ice and chill thoroughly. This will keep the flavour from coming out as you mix that too. It varies slightly from tablespoon to tablespoon in subtle ways, for example: 1/3 cup plus 2 tbsp sugar 2 tsp vanilla bean powder 1 tsp almond extract 1 tsp crushed 2 tsp coriander seeds 1 tsp orange zest A few drops of crushed or sweet sugar.\nPython Project Ideas Advanced\nI took this to water and added some salt, to it. Oh well, all of that sugar is not good. But it just blows us away, I think. On the way back to the shop, we decided to take this recipe over the internet because we hate the old ways of using this recipe. So we picked up a few different recipes – various styles here and there. The standard flour/vegan cookery recipe was 1 cup of one 12-inch loaf bread that we baked on a roasting rack. It looked a simple enough meal but slightly tacky and light enough for me. The standard base recipe included more flour.\nPython Programming Homework\nThis isn’t to downplay the complexity of the crust, so it didn’t really have all the add-ons to keep it from getting a little lumpy. You could also mix this look at more info other base recipes and bake with the loaves. Once we made our 2 cup, we sat down to eat some of the last of the cinnamon and pecan pie and some bananas. We quickly realized that our problem with cinnamon hadn’t been in our mind when we opened the lid. A nice little mess went round the corner and we didn’t want to let it out. So the next morning we took a shower. We couldn’t see much except the sea, which I was now convinced is an art form. However, on the morning we ended up in the kitchen looking at the bowl of pizza dough and looking for a pizza sauce.\n", "final_result_str": "no", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "18fa2e01-99e1-4bcf-b996-20e53230e3d2", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "why": "里面含有非正常文本格式"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "f9e10887-8aa0-4ec7-b0d3-b75dc8a15ba4", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "61b699ab-aa32-4e1d-90fc-21701fa47c3c", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "why": "各种主题混杂，缺乏连贯性"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "113966", "creator": "chupei", "data_id": "0ab54972-c280-4b6c-ac9e-a94d582e2f6d", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "why": "有异常格式"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001579", "creator": "jinzhenjiang", "data_id": "49bf5775-eb3c-4c9b-a1df-c6f20c9ead3a", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "why": "内容混乱"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "051560", "creator": "zengzhiyuan", "data_id": "e9ce1932-7f10-4a95-90c7-5d9781b0cdee", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "why": "上下文不对应 可能是广告"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

There was only one thing for it – go page by page through the magazine describing what each of us could see.\nWithout going into too much detail our conversation went something along the lines of …\nMother: ‘page 65 – white aga, blue & red print tea towels, turquoise/blue frying pan, white jug, shelf of glass jars’ ….. Me: ‘Yup’\nSkip forward to page 135… Mother: ‘feature on Thame – there you are in the shop window, see?’……Me: ‘No… creative country business course advert’\nI was clearly missing some pages.. was that possible?? Still confused, I did a shout out on twitter and the lovely Debra from The Gifted Penguin checked her copy… No such feature. Conclusion – Mother officially Mad.\nYesterday however, I went home for supper and on the kitchen table was her copy ‘with the hydrangeas in the galvanised bucket’ open at page 135. Lo and behold, there was the feature – ‘A Postcard from Thame’ & yes, if you look really really closely there are our cushions and napkins peeping out from the window of one of our lovely stockists – FROM\nThe question is… why does my mother have the feature and Debra & I don’t??……. any ideas?\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "94e08fa0-bcb4-44ec-8d5f-9c784f7e9355", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "67aab922-eaf7-41c8-a081-d509c3677c97", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "e1eadb1a-1a62-4cc3-b5cc-dbaf368b6aed", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "not_sure", "why": "没啥内容"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "113966", "creator": "chupei", "data_id": "a97ad353-cb4f-493d-82aa-42945809a8a0", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "why": "重复"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001579", "creator": "jinzhenjiang", "data_id": "3e515224-5f84-4437-9f38-bf14cba119b8", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "why": "内容混乱"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "051560", "creator": "zengzhiyuan", "data_id": "39bc435d-924c-439d-b3b2-9f9eb6e1c5c5", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "not_sure", "why": ""}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

And then there was covid. Here is Spain, we had a strict initial lockdown, but since then schools have stayed open and some cultural spaces have kept running in spite of restrictions on numbers. Before saying anything else, it is necessary to remind oneself that the new norm has involved social distancing, fifty per cent capacity for venues, compulsory hand sanitiser, masks, the recording of contact details and a temperature test on entry. This has severely restricted audience’s willingness to attend and has persuaded many, perhaps a majority of venues to cease activity altogether. In addition, performers’ travel has been as restricted as the population in general, despite there being the possibility of exemption permits for work. The combination of restrictions on travel, availability of travel and reluctant venues has severely curtailed cultural activity, however, and there have been many perennial supporters of live events who have expressed the opinion that such gatherings should not be happening during a pandemic. Opinion is on one side, while the law places the limits. Also, many more elderly regular attendees have decided that now is the time to lock up and stay in. Individuals have made their own choices.\nAnd now, on the day that bars and restaurants can open until ten o’clock in the evening and when cultural venues can admit seventy-five per cent of their capacity, it was under the previous, more severe restrictions that saw concerts on Friday evening, Saturday lunchtime and evening and Sunday lunchtime in Alfas del Pi and Alicante.\nOn Friday in Alfas del Pi, Antonio Garcia Egea and Fernando Espi joined as Duo Arbos to play a works from the repertoire of violin and guitar. This was the kind of programme one does not encounter often. It started conventionally with Spanish Dance no5 by Granados, but Carlo Domeniconi’s Sonatina Mexicana has probably not figured often on concert programmes in the last year. It has probably never been followed by Ravi Shankar’s El Alba Encantada, and the microtones of Indian music have probably never before led into Paganini’s Cantabile! Astor Piazzolla’s Historia del Tango, Bourdel 1900 and Café 1930 followed by Libertango was conventional in comparison, as perhaps was Pablo Sarasate’s Playera Romanza Andaluza, despite the understated but stratospheric virtuosity of the ending of the violin part. We finished the evening with Fernandon Espi’s own Impromptu and we were particularly grateful in these times to be taken by the performers on such a varied journey.\nOn Saturday lunchtime the orchestra at ADDA (Auditori de la Diputacion de Alicante) marked fifty years since the death of Igor Stravinsky with a breath-taking performance of Petroushka. Yes, it’s a work that the majority of the audience had hear many, many times, but it remains a work that is fresh with every new exposure and particularly so in this reading by Josep Vicent, whose reading of this music is faultless. The colours were always vivid, the scenes clear and beautifully depicted in this work that paints with sound. We also heard a superb reading of the Elgar Cello Concerto by Damian Martinez and then had encores of the Valse Triste of Sibelius and, and true to the form of current concerts, a short piece of Piazzolla, Oblivion, with the leader’s violin as soloist.\nThen on Saturday evening, back in Alfas del Pi Duo Fortecello, the cello and piano of Anna Mikulska and Philippe Argenty, gave the first of their two concerts. This one featured works by Chopin, Nocturne opus 9, Cello sonata and Polonaise Brillante coupled with Piazzolla (yet again!) in the form of the Triptyque “la Trilogie de l’Ange” and finally the Danse Macabre of Saint-Saens. We only just made the curfew…\nThen on Sunday, Duo Fortecello presented their second programme in Albir. While their first programme was the epitome of the conventional, the second was as opposite as it is possible to be. They opened with Joaquin Nin’s Seguida Española and followed with what proved to be a rare gem. Gaspar Cassado wrote a famous sonata for cello and piano based on old Spanish tunes, but this Sonata en la menor, though from the same year, 1925, is quite different in character. Exactly how many times this work has been performed in Spain cannot be assessed, but it is certainly not many times. And it may have been performed elsewhere even less. The work itself is superb and deserves to be much more widely heard, especially when it is compared to other works that form the basis of the repertoire for cello and piano. Any music lover will find great reward in searching out this work and hearing it performed. It has to be said that the fourth movement, Paso Doble, does not live up to the quality of the first three, but the criticism is minor. How many composers, after all, were capable of writing finales that lived up to their preceding movements?\nAnna and Philippe continued with a Flamenco solo for cello by Rogelio Huguet y Tagell and then Andaluza by Granados. Manuel de Falla’s Siete Canciones Populares Españolas is music of genius and Gaspar Cassado’s Requiebros, though derivative, is a superb way to finish any concert. And so the duo had given a musical tour of Spain, visiting most regions and sampling its musical soul. Superb. And what a relief from current preoccupations!\nPhilip Spires\nAuthor of Eileen McHugh, a life remade, a free downloadable biography of an unknown sculptor. http://www.philipspires.co.uk/eileen.htm\nEileen McHugh - a life remade - is a novel about a sculptor whose creative life ended in the 1970s.

Love you my friends? See transcript below.\nThe Arcturians, Pleiadians, and Orions:\nWhat we want to say to you today is, Yes you are each part of the other. You must however recognize, in terms of your experiencing, there is individuation which occurs as you separate from the whole. And this is also real. This is real in terms of your intention… your intention for coming here, your intention to experience.\nOf course there’s always a choice. You can intend to have experienced that separation, and now only experience the whole. This is difficult in terms of your remaining grounded upon the earth (that you even are creating, moving away from the old systems). There is still a potentiality within you that wishes to express itself in individuation, individuality, a measure of separation in terms of the ability to experience each other… the ability to interact [with] and learn from each other.\nYou are indeed a spark of your Divine Whole, THE Divine Whole, all that is, Source (you may call it). And within that experiencing, you integrate the expansiveness of this Whole. The expansiveness within you comes from and resides within in this Whole. But to enjoy each other, to experience the love (and the exacting opposite, or what you perceive to be the opposite of this love), this is part of the expansion. And therefore must be imbued, or rather must be perceived in terms of separation, or as a result of the separation. For you to make love with one another and to create with one another from this love… whether it results in more sparks of the Divine expressing itself through physical form… another physical body… another human, another being… or whether it be more sparks of the Divine in terms of art or education, crop growth, technology. All of these things are a result of your interaction with each other. And therefore, to have this interaction with each other and even with the different components of yourself, there must be an individual experience in the first place.\nThis is a common complex issue to be entertained and often grappled with when first realizing the Source of all things, and that you are indeed part of this vast Source of all things and not separate from it… and not answering to it… but rather residing within it and experiencing for it and you and all. This is often a complex subject in terms of this.\nWe are happy you are calling this information forth now in lieu of and in terms of your graduation of sorts to the next step in development (which there are many, and all at once, happening before now and will keep happening). All of this, happening in this now moment for you, calls this forth for you to remember your intention coming here. Your intention of reinstating this Divine application of powerful creation within you… and the relationship that is required with one another to experience this.\nWe love you, we love you, we love you!

I often feel bitter when I think of those in the business world who receive all sorts of financial and personal incentives for their work. People who go on all expense paid trips because they have sold the most insurance (selling you safety nets in case you fall, but you likely won’t, however you have to have it…) for example that year, meanwhile in that same year I may have resuscitated a child, held the hand of a dying man during his last breath and treated a father of 4 for a heart attack among caring for other incredible people. I received my same pay as always and more importantly, do not expect an incentive. I don’t feel bitter that I’m not getting a trip, I feel bitter that in this society, a pro-athlete or businessman is more supported than nurses. On the other side of the coin, it makes me wonder what sort of nursing culture would be bred if nurses were provided incentives for life saving measures or actions/treatment/education. And what treatments or care would be deemed “more important” than others, garnering a higher incentive? In the emergency department health teaching is imperative; to prevent illness and disease so one could argue that is as important as treating the patient having a stroke. If incentives in nursing existed would the wrong sort of people be attracted to the nursing profession? Some say it’s a calling, the art of the practice; only certain people can and will do the job and do it well have you. It would be worrisome to think that an individual would only want to save a life or teach parents about how to appropriately treat fevers if it meant they would get a financial bonus.\nAnd yet, despite all of this, I still struggle with the fact that people who sell the most cars, buy the most stock in a company, etc… are seemingly more valued and appreciated then those that save lives, give people more time on earth and genuinely (most of us at least) care about humanity. I have a hard time finding the balance in it all. Emergency nursing is in the “business of life saving” is it not? With more and more facilities receiving incentives for improved and rapid physician to patient initial assessment times, where does appreciation for the nurses fall in to all of this?\n(See also ONA’s website here and RNAO’s website for nursing week.)\nA Matter of Hours\nPosted by torontoemerg in Life in the Emergency Department, Navel Gazing, Random Thoughts on Sunday 14 August 2011\nI was talking the other day to young, surprisingly old-school physician who bemoaned nurses “doing things” she thought properly done by duly authorized medical practitioners. (She also implied, by-the-by, that when physicians said “Go fetch,” the proper nursely response was a demure “Yes, doctor, and do you want your neck rubbed?)” Clearly, this physician thought, medicine was the senior and superior discipline, and nurses should defer at all times to their judgement, even on matters clearly within the sphere of nursing. Her basis for this line of thought was that physicians got “thousands and thousands of hours” of clinical and classroom education while nurses only had a “few hundred hours of dubious training.”\nMy head almost nodded, subconsciously anyway, in agreement. Got us there. It’s a common theme, actually, when you see discussions of nursing versus medicine. Nurses just don’t have the education, it’s claimed, to make the really important decisions in patient care. But then I thought about it for a bit.\nLeaving apart the obvious — that medicine and nursing are two different (if related) disciplines — in point of fact, I had 1950 clinical hours and about 2000 hours of classroom study to become a Registered Nurse — and this doesn’t include the hundreds of hours more of post-graduate education to gain speciality certification and also training for things like ACLS and TNCC. I know it doesn’t compare to the extensive/intensive training of physicians. But still, nearly four thousand hours of formal training as a minimal entry to practice is nothing to sneeze at either, and hardly the “few hundred hours of dubious training” imagined by some physicians. At any rate, it makes me wonder why, given our own expertise, education and experience, why some nurses continue to be cowed by claims of physician superiority?\nMargaret Wente is Wrong on Substance Abuse\nPosted by torontoemerg in Before I Start Throwing Things, I'd Better Write This Down, Health Care Policy That Matters to Nursing on Tuesday 17 May 2011\nMargaret Wente opines on drug addiction based on some book she read:\nAdvocates for the disease model of addiction say their arguments are evidence-based, and that their opponents are driven by ideology. But the closer you look, the shakier is the evidence for the disease model of addiction. The most cogent critique comes from Gene Heyman, a research psychologist and lecturer at Harvard Medical School. His book Addiction: A Disorder of Choice makes a convincing case that choice plays a much more important role in addiction than in other psychiatric disorders. And it demolishes the current “enlightened” picture of addiction as a chronic, relapsing illness with a bleak prognosis for recovery.\nShe concludes, against the general medical consensus (those elitists!) that\n[d]rug addiction is a set of self-destructive impulses that are out of control – just like all the other impulses that lead us to choose short-term pleasure at the price of long-term pain.\nThe thing I always find remarkable about Wente is that under the guise of being contrarian, she almost always ends up confirming popular prejudices. Addiction is not a disease! Addicts deserve everything they get! Addiction is a moral choice! Conventional treatment enables addicts! Helping addicts by providing harm reduction strategies is wrong! Punish addicts for their addiction! And so on.\nWente nods (very) briefly to the benefits of the disease model of addiction, and the need to treat addicts with empathy and compassion. But how many people actually remember the real reasons we treat sick people, including substance abusers, in the rush to judgement?\n“A disease is a condition,” Wente says, “that’s beyond your power to control.” Well, no. I would define disease, and I think I would get nods of agreement from my health professional colleagues, as any condition that prevents an individual from functioning with optimal social, mental or physical well-being. Unfortunately Wente thinks disease is always something entirely random, like bacterial meningitis or ALS. What I would like to ask Wente is this: if addiction is not a disease, and if addicts are entirely responsible for their condition, what about non-insulin dependent diabetics and those suffering from heart disease, which have strong links to lifestyle choices and, some would say, self-destructive impulses? Why should we treat them any differently than drug addicts?\nThe point is we all make choices, good or bad, for our health. Choice, however, often implies a moral value judgement and the assignment of blame: two things clinicians should avoid in treating patients. But choice — whether it’s your 80-year-old diabetic grandmother or the homeless substance abuser down the street — shouldn’t be confused with disease.\nObservations and Assessments\nPosted by torontoemerg in Before I Start Throwing Things, I'd Better Write This Down, Blogging Navel Gazing, Random Thoughts, What Passes for Humour Around Here on Thursday 07 April 2011\nNotions too small for a blog post all in one place.\nApril Foolishness. I guess I got — or more likely annoyed — a few of you with my little April Fool’s prank. In case you missed it, I faked a news report from Trout Creek, Montana (pop. 261) stating the local hospital was going to fire all it nurses and replace them with housekeepers. I even put up a picture of some hospital in India, complete with palm trees (in Montana!). Some of you waxed quite indignant before realizing it was the First of April. What’s interesting is how readily people believed it — which speaks volumes about nurses’ perceptions about how they are valued by their employers. Which is to say, not much.\nNurse goes all postal on Craigslist. This epic rant has been making the rounds — those with delicate sensibilities may want to avert their eyes:\nWell, after a year of getting rejected I have finally decided to give nursing the bird. FUCK YOU NURSING FIELD! Too bad the schools and media are still insisting that people go to RN school. Believe me THERE IS NO FUCKING SHORTAGE! New grads are considered garbage. On top of that, the degree serves no purpose in any other setting. BSN is a complete waste of time and money.\nI know, “some people got jobs”. That does not justify the majority (1000’s) who did not and are now working retail for minimum wage. There is something fundamentally wrong with this country. My school counselors, nursing instructors, media and nurses I know urged me to go into nursing. As soon as I got my degree and the check to the school cleared I heard the unmistakable sound of the door to nursing closing—slamming actually. And it is not just the economy. Hospitals turning huge profits stopped new grad programs and hire foreigners.\nIt is over. I am a stale grad and I am out of options. The new graduates fresh out of their precepts will be flooding the market to add to the already rancid oversaturated pool of disgruntled STALE GRADS. So, I guess giving up a nice job for school, dedicating 6 years (yes, I was foolish enough to get the BSN), dropping 20 grand and putting up with nursing school stress was all for nothing.\nAnd no, higher education is out for 2 reasons. One, you need RN experience to qualify for any NP program. Second, why would I throw more money at a system that just failed me and ruined my life? It is clear that the educational system is bunk. I am completely embarrassed at the education I experienced at the California State University–It is appauling.\nI hate nursing. I hate it so fucking much now. The true colors of the profession are now clear. So, now society can have a derelict because that is what I intend to become. I now plan to make a living mooching off the system.\nIt would probably take a year of posting to unpack all of this. Suffice to say, I do have the tiniest bit of sympathy for her, as I graduated at the nadir of nursing joblessness in the ’90s and was forced to work part-time for the first three years of my career. That being said, I wonder at her commitment to the profession, despite the six years of expensive education; one senses she wants her dream job handed to her on a platter. It doesn’t work like that. So I’m with everyone else: don’t let the door hit you on the way out. Or else come to Toronto — I know some 5 North nurses who would love to have you as a colleague — and they’re hiring.\nUterus, uterus, uterus. In another take to the uterus-as-filthy-word story, now you can incorporate your womb. (Thanks Terri!)\nTake me to your leader. In case my American friends and readers haven’t noticed, we’re finishing up the second week of a federal election campaign, where the forces of light and the agents of doom and darkness will collide in a colossal battle for the heart and soul of the nation, etc. Being the flaming left-wing commie-pinko-socialist I am, I will prevaricate until the very last minute till inevitably holding my nose and voting Liberal. All which is to say, if I seem more, um, political in the next few weeks, I can’t help it, it’s the environment.\nHope they were praying for epinephrine. Speaking of Members of Parliament, there’s a report in the Le Devoir this morning that three Conservative MPs witnessing a severe allergic reaction on a flight to Taiwan responded by laying on the hands and praying. I guess I slept through that part in my critical care courses where Prayer comes before Airway, Breathing, Circulation.

One of the less appealing aspects of my job as Charge Nurse is dealing with patient complaints. When I heard the commotion out at Triage, I automatically went out to the front to see if I could resolve the problem. It was, I thought at the time, a more-or-less standard concern about the wait times: the patient had come in because of fairly severe abdominal pain, and her daughter thought her mother was not receiving appropriate treatment. I reviewed the chart to assure myself we had done everything for the patient we could at this point, in particular ensuring her CTAS score was correct* and that we had begun blood and urine tests. Further, I had the triage nurse reassess the patient: vital signs were stable, and she did not now seem to be in any particular distress, even by her own admission. And the more immediate problem for me: the ED was packed and there was literally not a stretcher to be had, even if I thought the patient needed a bed immediately. It was when I discussed all of this with the daughter of the patient she accused me of racism.\nI’ve been called racist before, always in the context of patient and family perceiving their care is substandard because of their race. For nurses, it’s an accusation which adds a layer of complexity to care. In the first place, for me, and many nurses, the epithet is personally distressing. It makes us wary around patients who call us racist; it changes the nature of the nurse-patient relationship. We think we provide colour-blind care because in treating patients we are subject to all sorts of constraints barely perceived by the public, and which have nothing to do with race. Practically speaking, when a patient or a family utters the r-word, a nurse has to start a long trail of documentation for his own protection, which ironically, will delay care further. And knowing all that, we tend to believe the word is used manipulatively to jump the queue or otherwise to receive preferential treatment. It’s a situation rarely, if ever resolved happily, if only because the emotions evoked. Calling someone racist is very powerful.\nMy standard response to patients who make the accusation of racism has always been along the lines that we provide care regardless of race or any of the protected categories, such as religion or culture. I try not to take it personally. I strongly believe that in Toronto, which is the most culturally diverse city on the planet, it’s nearly a practical impossibility to be obviously racist and work in a health care profession. In my own ED, we have nurses and physicians whose family origins are literally on every continent except Antarctica, and we treat an incredibly diverse population, with large numbers of immigrants and new Canadians. My reasoning is the reality of working in health care will cull out bigots: they will be simply unable to cope. And I can say without hesitation I never personally have seen overt racism affect patient care.\nSharp-eyed readers will notice I’m hedging a bit, because I’m starting to think about my own assumptions about racism and health care. In what context did the daughter make the accusation? What was her experience of the health care system? Some of us unfairly, unjustly and without objective evidence tend to think of such-and-such ethnic or racial group as being “stoic” or “hysterical” or “prone to crime” or “violent’ or “indigent.” This does have consequences for care. The death of Brian Sinclair, for example, about which I’ve written about elsewhere, was almost certainly in part because of stereotyped attitudes about aboriginal people. I suspect we harbour more racist attitudes than I would like to believe of my colleagues. In 2009 a professor at York University named Tania Das Gupta released the results of a survey of 573 Ontario nurses, in association with book she published on racism and nursing called Real Nurses and Others: Racism in Nursing:\nIn the survey, 41 per cent responded that they had been made to feel uncomfortable because of their race, colour or ethnicity. Most Black/African Canadian nurses (82 per cent) and Asian Canadian nurses (80 per cent) said they had experienced this, as well as 50 per cent of South Asian Canadian nurses and 57 per cent of Central/South American Canadian nurses.

Inculcation starts early. When I was a student working through a med-surg rotation, I cared for a demented patient who was literally bleating like a sheep; my instructor, walking by her room, began to sing “Mary had a little lamb” before throwing a mock-shocked hand to her mouth, and giggling. Later on, younger and idealistic, I was appalled by what I now know is typical cynical emergency department humour. GOMERs* go to ground and GOMERs never die. Elderly patients with conspicuous luggage, dropped off by families unable to cope, have a “positive suitcase sign”. Certain patients get labels, humorous in intent, but not usually in execution. Repeat visitors are called “frequent fliers”, young women (“MIDs” — muffins in distress) and persons wanting narcotics (“DSIs” — drug seeking individuals). Codes and death are in particular subjects of black-toned laughter, as we rustle the body bags and remove the tubes. I’ve heard some remarkably dark humour after the death of children, none of which I can bear to repeat. As nurses and physicians, we’ve all been there. Something unbearably awful happens to a patient, and somebody cracks wise. It’s all wildly inappropriate, horrible, demeaning to us and to the patient. We laugh anyway. Is it unwise? Perhaps.\nA few days ago Paul Jones documented his discomfort with black humour:\nRecently I heard a physician make a comment that this patient is “a classic case of FTD”.\nI as a naive medical student enquired what “FTD” meant?\nThe physician responded drly, “failure to die”.\nThis comment left me with a deep sense of discomfort and reminded me of the type of humor I had witnessed many times before in the ER, OR and ICU. Often in the health care profession we are placed under extraordinary amounts of pressure where human lives hang in the balance. Doctors and nurses say things which would horrify the lay public (or even sometimes ourselves in any other context).\nI’ve heard the term “FTD” myself in my emergency department. It’s not a term I particularly like, though it has a certain currency with my younger colleagues. Having said that, I know exactly who this FTD patient is. She is the nonverbal, contractured, 80-something from the nursing home down the road, with Alzheimer’s dementia and multiple strokes, who’s come for the fifth time in three months in for aspiration pneumonia/urinary tract infection/blocked PEG tube. She’s the one being kept alive, almost pointlessly, because our professional ethics demand no less. I’ve written elsewhere about black humour. We can talk about how stress, and the peculiar institutional culture of health care agencies fosters gallows comedy in all of us. But I think now there is something more essential happening; the term “Failure to die” provides a real clue. Simply, black humour allows us to maintain a semblance of control, and perhaps more importantly, distance over the seemingly endless, ungovernable suffering of the human beings we treat. Having seen, assessed, and cared for such patients in the multiples of hundreds, I can understand the impulse intimately. And so it goes for all the other instances of black humour. Laughter is insurance against giving up completely.\nBlack humour can be unwise. Patients and families may overhear us, and misconstrue our words as indifference or callousness. Danger lies when black humour stereotypes and therefore devalues a patient or worse, dehumanizes or even demonizes. It can destroy empathy and distort objectivity. This is how nurses provide poor care, and physicians misdiagnose. The wisdom is having the insight to understand the sources of black humour in our own relative helplessness, and to recognize it, first, as an inevitable part of our practice, and secondly, as having a time and a place. Truthfully, we see ourselves in our patients. We are burdened with the knowledge of what will debilitate, and eventually kill us. We laugh against fear. To that end, perhaps, black humour allows us to remain fully human professionals and to carry on treating and caring for our patients with care and empathy.\n__________\n*GOMER = Get Out of My Emergency Room, i.e. typically elderly, demented patients with chronic, complex and usually incurable conditions.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "66ef2021-28c4-4bab-b6fb-17914408659a", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "内容混乱", "repair": "no_repair"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "6c254dca-a9f5-4829-8f16-2e26b7dfc007", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "医护工会活动讨论"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "af006927-5e2f-48f6-b51b-0c3aa9da688e", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "聚合性内容有分割"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "0332c744-7408-415b-b2a8-3125f32be890", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "- 博文聚合\n- 需要拆分", "repair": "need_repair"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

When I purchased my OnePlus 5 a month ago I order the Orzly Pro-Fit Glass Screen Protector and Orzly FlexiCase from amazon. Ive had their products before on my OnePlus 2 and they have been a good balance between price and performance….times have changed and not all for the better.\nSo the office OnePlus Glass Screen Protector retails on their site for £17.95 which at first seems quite steep when the average branded glass protectors comes in about £5 to £8. The Orzly was £9.99 from Amazon for 2 protectors, I though it was a little odd, I have never seen the need for twin packs but I though it would be handy to have a space. I know why you will need two and I’ll come to that shortly.\nAll the Glass protectors I have in the past have a really cool method of application, Clean the screen, remove dust and lastly peel of plastic back and line up glass. Once lined up a press in the middle and the magic happens, no bubbles and good adhesion (hence my OnePlus2 has the same protector on 3 years laster!) With the Orzly Pro-Fit Glass Screen Protector for OnePlus 5 I was a little put off when I notice the whole screen didn’t have the adhesive on, only the black boarders. On the positive side it will be impossible to get bubbles but if it does not stick properly then dust will collect and collect it did 🙁\nAfter cleaning and installing the Orzly Pro-Fit Glass Screen Protector there was an instant clicking sound in the bottom left corner of the screen….. its not sticking properly!!! I also notice and Oil slick effect in the middle of the screen when the screen is off and also an array of dots over the whole screen (why did I ever remove the plastic one already install for this). I gave it a few days and all issues still remained with the addition that these screen are finger print magnets too…. I installed the second screen protector thinking maybe it was just a faulty one but after 14 days in Sardinia my screen now has more dust behind it that all of my phones I’ve ever had in my life.\nI emailed the Orzly on Amazon and was asked to produce pictures, which I did but heard nothing, roll on a couple of days I messaged again…was asked if i wanted to try another pack…..hmmmm from the forums and seeing a friend use the official Screen (which does have the Magic all over screen adhesive) I thought it was best to get a refund. a few more days and nothing. Contacted though Amazon and it seems they were not getting my replies and emails….strange….so a new set was finally sent out but I know I will be looking for replacement ones in a few weeks tops as I’ve got the clicking noise already :S\nSo to recap\nPRO’s\n1) Cheaper than official\n2) You get 2\n3) Fits with Orzly FlexiCase\n4) Looks identical to Official\n5) Quality Glass – feels like Original screen\nCons\n1) Smudge/Finger Print magnets\n2) You need 2 😛\n3) Adhesive is only on edges – No all over Magic\n4) Orzly Customer service seem disjointed\n5) Clicking NOISE!!!!\n6) Oil Slick effect\n7) Dots all over front screen\n8) Boarders block lights and edge of screen (even when perfectly lined up)\nOver all I’m not really happy with this product, dust build up due to poor adhesion is the big thing, shame really as I was a name I would usually recommend and not think twice about weather to gear up with on a new phone. I’ll think twice now.\nAny one happy with theirs pop it in the comments below.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "c09d2bf6-ef7a-4651-b33b-810e6de2f6d2", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "上下文通顺"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "32c7077e-d419-41fb-94d5-2cf73b868c43", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 图文教程内容，"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "7176ec65-7015-4890-bd04-1e63cf875244", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "语法错误多", "repair": "no_repair"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "763b7218-5ca0-4a77-a6bf-cf55f90b053a", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "手机保护膜的使用评测"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

They were all low to mid 4 star, in the last year of their contracts and while solid, were starting to fade after a few years in my team. As a result I decided I was going to get rid of every single player in my team and rebuy new players.\nWith the new scout market up and running I noticed I had a lot more option for players than before. I think on the old market you had 22 scouts all at 50 Tokens each. Now my scout list looks to be around 40 in number, ranging from 39 up to 69 Tokens per person. I decided to look at the youngest and best players on the list, most of which were between 59 and 69 tokens to bring into my team and in the end I brought 9 scouts in for various prices.\nWhile dipping in and out of the scout market I also used the negotiations list to bring in a further 5 players. I topped my recruitment spree off by signing the remaining players off the open market.\nWith 21 players signed up (I am still on the look out for another Goalkeeper, however I'm in no rush to add one as its a position that never gets sent off and one where I have plenty of packs to cover injuries) I then decided the next best thing to do was to power train my new recruits.\nThis is the end result, after my purchases and power training -\nCurrent stats after all this -\n254M cash\n11,675 Tokens\n861 Red\n953 Blue\n7 Green\n21.6 average age\n6 star 152.5 average.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "195a3bcc-cb2c-491d-8521-8e60e879020e", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "内容连贯，描述经验分享"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "1439e447-7b67-4fda-960d-13d3abb16efd", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "内容缺少后，最后的句子看不懂", "repair": "need_repair"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "056e340f-3c3a-4997-a314-e295d31be698", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "游戏的讨论"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "78ee78bd-9a08-4b52-99ab-e6daab39ebd1", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 语义通顺"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

In the event, OSK perfectly created and executed the concept that both SUVs play equally essential but distinct roles, fitting in environments with diverse landscapes, reminiscent of Shan Chuan (山川) – two related yet distinct characters, inspired by the power and duality of the natural elements of mountain and river. For this, Chongqing was the perfect backdrop for the stage.\nAt the workshop, OSK provided an interactive and lively array of exhibitions, including several touchscreens, in order to demonstrate the features of the GLE SUV. At two theme parks, the test drive program offered a chance for media to experience the dynamic safety functions and assistant systems under unusual road conditions – one mountain road and one forest road.\nWithout a doubt, the highlight of the launch show was the launch performance – a breathtaking, interactive show that used both a vertical LED wall and a fully customizable LED floor that let guests experience how the GLE SUV truly masters all terrains, and all aspects in life.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "a96c4aa1-3ccc-4d30-8882-7e093cea9464", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "主题明确"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "13a70e4f-58f3-4f52-9f43-64ace35eb013", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "车辆展示活动记录"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "e6367645-e9f2-4894-9c68-ebeff842ac00", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 汽车营销内容，语义通顺"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "9fa582cf-7e18-4637-a7a2-001762535170", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "优质广告"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

However , some recommendations never appear to change. Amongst these internet dating my sources suggestions for men will be honesty and being yourself. Being yourself draws men and is a great attraction for most ladies. Men will be attracted to women who are exceptional. Here are some basic ways to entice men:\nIs not going to brag about your job, car, or bank account. Instead, discuss your interests and skills, and become sure to become yourself. Currently being cocky or haughty will not likely impress anyone. If you are positive, it will make a male look good and may attract ladies. However , don’t let that self confidence translate into opbl?sthed. Be your self and make sure that he feels the same way. Any time this doesn’t function, try becoming yourself with him.\nSteer clear of playing hard to get. While playing hard to obtain isn’t a romantic relationship rule, a lot of self-reflection can be beneficial. For instance, if you aren’t feeling a certain method after a time frame, you may want to speak it over having a trusted friend. He or she can provide feedback that can assist you assess the romance. Moreover, good friends who will be in fully commited relationships may be helpful than patients who will be in a one-night-stand.\nLastly, seeing in your twenties can be fun, but it surely can also be a hard time. Your physical virility is a an all-time high, thus dating with this age group might feel difficult and nerve-wracking. Follow these dating tips for males over 45 to make the most of your dating experience. And if you remain single, be sure to keep yourself confident. If you feel straight down and stressed, keep these tips in mind and you will find a good day soon.\nSome other dating tip for men is to prevent being overly needy. A large number of single guys put pressure on themselves by representing different when they’re with women they just like. Women may sense needy behavior and will reject you if that they sense it. Dating apps also support men meet new people and keep their particular dance control cards full. Don’t forget to read critiques of online dating apps to have a better idea of how very well they function. The more you already know about online dating tips for males, the better off you’ll be in locating someone.\nOnce posting the photos, be sure to have a variety of photos. Preferably, you should have a face-to-face photography, although make sure the images are actual. People always like to see those who are happy and fun. You should definitely include some pictures of your self in various options. This will make the man come to feel more comfortable. This may even cause a date, or even a mate. Somebody, this is a dating web-site, so make sure that your pictures are authentic.\nStaying confident is a crucial tip with regards to dating. Girls like a positive guy who is open-minded and genuine. Avoid trying to impress them with your financial status or perhaps your car. Make an effort to focus on the strengths and stay open to new experiences. This way, you’ll find the ideal girl very fast. Also, tend not to overly expressive signals. These tips are supposed to help you find a lady who you may enjoy spending time with.\nLast but not least, make sure to let down your phone while on a date. Completing this task will show that you aren’t present and focused on the date. That shows that you are in the moment and not taking into consideration the past. Avoid making common dad flaws. Turn off the cell phone and remain present, instead. Typically, turn the cell phone and focus on getting to know a man. Like that, you’ll help to make a lasting impression on your night out.\nRemember, going out with rules will vary than in your daily life. For anyone who is asking women out for the very first time, be sure to offer to fund the food. It’s not cool to refuse to separated the bill. The other party will probably be angry along, and you’ll end up with an awkward predicament. Likewise, don’t forget that you are not the only one in the world who has to have a date.\nProbably the greatest dating methods for men is going to be yourself. Whilst online dating may be intimidating, it’s not hard to be your self by arranging a well-planned time frame. The best spots to take a date are local, smaller restaurants. They’re noise-free, more intimate, and more going to create an environment conducive to conversation. Additionally, you’ll have more opportunities to strike up a dialog with your date when you are comfortable talking about your life and interests.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "58268b72-53b3-46b1-a9b4-dadbc5bbae4d", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "上下文连贯"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "84233e49-1f0e-41b5-842b-431002b0380e", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 约会教程，语义通顺"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "552e4785-a87a-4d9b-8317-cc08d922bde3", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "男士约会指南"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "bf7c85e9-4e7f-426c-8e55-1ca7d18a2804", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "交友建议"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

I would recommend this program. The service alone is \"worth the price of admission\".\nVDX Distro, Inc\nGreat app, this solved our complex multi-tier pricing issues. It also allowed us to create custom bulk order forms for our wholesale website. In addition the team was very informative and helpful in helping to implement the app. Rohan in particular was instrumental in helping create a plan and make it work. The man with all the solutions! Much appreciated. Highly reccomended.\nSimplova\nThe Wholesale order form is great for returning customers who know what they want to buy. The support team behind the scenes are awesome. They answer your questions quickly and are ready to help you with anything you need. I recommend this app to any B2B website or where you often have returning customers.\nThe Roots Products\nReally easy to use app, but the best part has to be the responsive and above-and-beyond level of support! They haven't hesitated to meet all of my (very specific and finicky) needs! So glad I found this app and I can't wait to put it to use.\nFlatout Apparel Inc.\nI've been using wholesale apps for a few years now.

This type of mobile communication and collaboration improves patient outcomes while minimising disruptions for primary care physicians and hospital staff.\nMaximum efficiency and productivity translates to maximum profitability\nWhen radiologists are allowed to complete and pass along the many imaging reports they encounter each day with minimal interruption, distraction or delay, workflow is enhanced and profitability increase, always to the satisfaction of radiology managers, CFOs and CEOs.\nWhen imaging reports are sent to referring physcians without delay, everyone wins. Perhaps more important, minimising interruptions logically minimises physician errors, resulting in superior patient care and improved outcomes. Unfortunately, distractions remain very much a part of everyday life for many radiologists.\nHistorically, a major workflow impediment has been where the radiology reporting rooms receive calls, which interrupt the work of radiologists 90 percent of the time and may decrease reporting accuracy significantly, according to researchers. Each week, radiologists field scores of calls in reporting rooms everywhere.\nDr. Christopher Watura and his colleagues wrote in Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology that fewer than one in 10 inbound calls are deemed appropriate interruptions to the workflow of radiologists who must field them, often while in the midst of important and even potentially lifesaving clinical work.\nThere's another important interruption, however, one that is often overlooked: radiologists often must call referrers to notify them that a report has been completed. With each call comes a departure from work and the possibility that a radiologist will remain on hols until the referrer comes to the phone- and only if the clinician is reached and available. If they are not able to connect, it will mean yet another inbound return call to the radiologist.\nThe app's unique features include secure login with TouchID, a dynamic patient list that enables quick searches, extensive filtering (including modality and time filters), a convenient basic report view as well as an in-depth full report view, display of all key images in the study, and enhanced data security through deep linking. No PHI is stored on their mobile viewing device.\nThe app is first protected by the mobile phone user's passwords and fingerprints, and then protected further with a quick secuirty question just prior to opening your first study. After that, the server recognises that device as safe and the referring physcian can access studies with a simple swipe and a fingerprint scan.\nGetting started with AlertView\nRequired Software: Enterprise Nova RIS or reports Distribution Manager 8.6.7 (or higher) so that works with NovaPro and other sites. Available for iOS app only at product introduction. Works with iPhone and iPad.\n-\niPad users will need to use iMessage via WiFi unless their iPad also has mobile network, in which case it will operate the same as an iPhone\n-\nMedical Group users can access reports for patients in any medical group for which the MD is a member\n-\nPrinting is done via the Print screen to wireless enabled devices\nUser interface\nHot link message provide instant access to report\n-\nThe referring MD receives a text alert, they click on the link, and are instantly viewing the report in AlertView without having to log in.\nSearch the patient to view report\n-\nUpon receiving a call from a patient the referring physician needs to see the report to remind him of the details. Users log into the AlertView app, search for the patient, and view the report.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "fbbec64d-617f-4e58-a155-fa8c868e60d9", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "正常的营销"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "fc0ad71b-f3c8-4a3d-b0cf-5a14d59e2be5", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "医疗报警软件推广"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "c1652d26-2c7b-461e-b04a-eb38df401755", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "产品介绍，有分隔"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "2c00c09b-0ceb-4de0-9580-59099719dc2a", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "将无关内容删减", "repair": "need_repair"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Your video should immediately convey its value and answer that “why should I watch it?” question that will be on your audience’s mind. Should they watch it because it will make them laugh, because it will inspire them to act or because it will teach them something new?\nFinally, revenue that comes from delighting your customer should be easier to track since you already have a purchase on file. You’ll likely have a user profile for each customer or some form of contact information from them — every return visit won’t correlate to a new sale, but tracking their behavior will give you a good idea of how many return visitors convert. Then apply this percentage to the number of return website visitors and you’re set! Hopefully, your sales department will also have a good idea of how many first time buyers purchase more than once.\nWhen running PPC ads, it's important that you keep careful track of the specific ads and keywords that you're targeting. You can do this by using the Google Analytics UTM builder to create campaign URLs that you can use to track the campaign source, the medium and any keywords or terms that you might be targeting. This way, you can determine the effectiveness of any campaign that you run and figure out the precise conversion rate.\nThe popularity of video also means that more content at the top of the funnel has to be in video format. In B2C it’s almost obvious. But B2B-people are people, too. Video content is more likely to keep the audience in the comfort zone, and they will not engage in system 2 thinking. System 1 autopilot mental state should lead to less critical thinking, less friction, and more conversions.\nAnother way search engine marketing is managed is by contextual advertising. Here marketers place ads on other sites or portals that carry information relevant to their products so that the ads jump into the circle of vision of browsers who are seeking information from those sites. A successful SEM plan is the approach to capture the relationships amongst information searchers, businesses, and search engines. Search engines were not important to some industries in the past, but over the past years the use of search engines for accessing information has become vital to increase business opportunities. The use of SEM strategic tools for businesses such as tourism can attract potential consumers to view their products, but it could also pose various challenges. These challenges could be the competition that companies face amongst their industry and other sources of information that could draw the attention of online consumers. To assist the combat of challenges, the main objective for businesses applying SEM is to improve and maintain their ranking as high as possible on SERPs so that they can gain visibility. Therefore, search engines are adjusting and developing algorithms and the shifting criteria by which web pages are ranked sequentially to combat against search engine misuse and spamming, and to supply the most relevant information to searchers. This could enhance the relationship amongst information searchers, businesses, and search engines by understanding the strategies of marketing to attract business.\nShort video allows your business to highlight a topic, summarize a written webpage and create a low-cost, low-effort piece of content to aid your inbound marketing efforts, like the video version of a blog. If you can’t say everything you need to in order to provide value, insight or help your consumers solve a problem, use short videos as a teaser for your written or graphic content.\nAdvertiser Disclosure: Some of the products that appear on this site are from companies from which QuinStreet receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where products appear on this site including, for example, the order in which they appear. QuinStreet does not include all companies or all types of products available in the marketplace.\nInstead, invest in an external hard drive like one of the Lacie Rugged models. External hard drives come in a variety of sizes and port options (Thunderbolt, USB 3.0, etc.). Multimedia creators will use the phrase “working off of an external” to describe storing all of their project files on this hard drive. This method also makes it easier to collaborate with teammates because you can easily share the drive.\nDig deep into everything you ever needed to know about links from anchor text to redirection. Read this series of pages to understand how and when to use nofollow and whether guest blogging is actually dead. If you're more into the link building side of things (working to improve the rankings on your site by earning links), go straight to the Beginner's Guide to Link Building.\nI liken this to a paradoxical Catch-22 scenario, because it seems like without one you can't have the other. It takes money to drive traffic, but it takes traffic to make money. So don't make the mistake that millions of other online marketers make around the world. Before you attempt to scale or send any semblance of traffic to your offers, be sure to split-test things to oblivion and determine your conversion rates before diving in headfirst.\nThis last step of the inbound marketing methodology isn’t a stage of the buyer’s journey because technically, this stage happens after a purchase. Yet it’s an awesome opportunity for video marketing. The goal here is to make your current customers so happy that they’ll become brand promoters. Let loose and have some creative fun with these videos, you have a lot less to lose here than in any other stage.\nSEO is also about making your search engine result relevant to the user's search query so more people click the result when it is shown in search. In this process, snippets of text and meta data are optimized to ensure your snippet of information is appealing in the context of the search query to obtain a high CTR (click through rate) from search results.\nThis year, for the first time, Google stated that user experience would be a core part of gaining rankings for mobile websites. A poorer user experience would send your site hurtling down the rankings. This appeared to come as a shock to many in the SEO community and despite assurances that content was still king – many seemed to feel that this ...\nNative on-platform analytics, including Facebook’s Insights, Twitter’s Analytics, and Instagram’s Insights. These platforms can help you evaluate your on-platform metrics such as likes, shares, retweets, comments, and direct messages. With this information, you can evaluate the effectiveness of your community-building efforts and your audience’s interest in your content.\nThere are a lot of fantastic points in this article. Video is absolutely the way to go because of just how engaging it is with customers. But when dealing with mobile there are a couple things that you need to make sure you are doing. You need to capture their attention early since attention span on mobile (especially on apps like Facebook) is pretty low. Design the video for sound-off viewing with things like subtitles. Have a clear call to action at the end of your video. The last thing is to plan for vertical viewing since “people are 67% more likely to watch the full length of square videos than they are to watch horizontal ones.” (source: https://sundaysky.com/blog/5-mobile-video-best-practices/ )\nYou’ve got your KPIs — but KPIs alone don’t equal money in the bank.

You may want to check out Bob Murch's 'Pulp Adventure' figures as he has several in his 'Yangzee Gangs' range that may work well within your theme.ReplyDelete\nhttp://pulpfigures.com/\nCheers,\nCurt\nPut a goatee on the big guy and it's like a mirror image, great work though!ReplyDelete\nLovely painting and figures and the effects of your photography in picture three looks very effective.ReplyDelete\nIt would be intersting to know how many figures you have in your ever expanding 'secret project' collection.\nBeautiful work Michael, and I am looking forward to seeing the completed Laundry.ReplyDelete\nI know what you mean about blogging and 'commenting'; I'm struggling to get round all the blogs I now follow...\nSuch great minis & well painted! Great background for them- both real & created. You know, on the Warhammer Forum right now, is a painting competition for a 2 character team: any genre minis is fine, it's not limited to warhammer or even GW in general: I won the last competition so I got to create the theme for this one, so i know these two qualify for the theme ;) You should enter them :)ReplyDelete\nGreat paintjobs there Michael on both figures and I rather like the palette used. Good history behind them too.ReplyDelete\nAnd real life is also more important than bloging mate, just take care of yourself.\n", "final_result_str": "no", "final_result": "no", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "b82bbc6c-a632-43b4-9097-e8a293a1f4c1", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "内容混乱", "repair": "no_repair"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "49351244-7183-4cad-8a8a-fdcbf3762eef", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "质量较差，评论的对象没有爬下来", "repair": "no_repair"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "b705882e-02e5-4da4-b570-ed942bceb789", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "- 评论聚合", "repair": "no_repair"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "c5366ee6-851e-459b-91d2-e5b5bcfe8382", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "no", "evidence": "语法错误多 \n评论之间有回复删除", "repair": "no_repair"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}

Starting with a somewhat drab and dingy shop space that had once housed a fish and chip takeaway, it now presents a light filled breezy space that connects passers-by with those working within.\nBeautifully crafted large scale timber and glass sliding panels replaced old aluminium framed shopfront walls, while years of accumulated floor finishes were peeled back to allow a beautiful concrete slab from the 60’s to be polished up as a major element in the design. Standard suspended ceiling panels made way for a dramatic black ceiling that recedes into shadow and visually expands the space. What had been concealed ceiling space filled with ducts and fluoro troughs, now adds extra volume to the space, enhanced by the seamless glass highlights of the new facade.\nInside, divisions are kept low to enhance the feeling of spaciousness in what is only a 50 square metre footprint. Overhead open shelves present a mix of plants, models, souvenirs, ‘natural found objects’, books, and project folders to provide a combination of information, beauty and amusement. Desks are adjustable from sitting to standing mode and a selection of seat styles are provided for staff.\n", "final_result_str": "yes", "final_result": "yes", "eval_data_list": [{"creator_id": "157536", "creator": "pekopoke", "data_id": "65333007-7e10-483a-9318-ab240dfcd10b", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "介绍办公室的广告"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "0001745", "creator": "garyshum", "data_id": "a07eb011-3d44-48e5-987e-3237ec3d31d9", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "- 营销内容，语义通顺"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "053249", "creator": "quyuan", "data_id": "84520185-9ca8-47bd-b90f-9509c84c7fa7", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "工作室介绍"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}, {"creator_id": "050640", "creator": "qiujiantao", "data_id": "eb5142b1-fa85-451b-a366-2e7e02882291", "evaluation": {"data_evaluation": null, "message_evaluation": null, "conversation_evaluation": {"quality": "yes", "evidence": "阐述建筑设计思路，内容质量不错"}, "questionnaire_evaluation": {"is_invalid_questionnaire": false}}}]}
