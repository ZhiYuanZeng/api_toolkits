Institutions or characters, which are in\nthemselves consistent, probably gain by this method of proceeding,\nprovided the execution be not unworthy of the design. For it secures\ntheir exhibition in more, and more varied, points of view, than can\npossibly be covered by the more didactic process. But the possession of\nthis advantage depends upon the fact, that there is in them a harmony,\nwhich is their base, and which we have only to discover. Whereas, if\nthat harmony be wanting, if in lieu of it there be a groundwork of\nfundamental discrepancy, then the conditions of effect are wholly\nchanged. The multiplied variety of view becomes a multiplication\nof incongruity; each new aspect offers a new problem: and the more\nmasterly the hand of the artist, the more arduous becomes the attempt\nto comprehend and present in their mutual bearings the pictures he has\ndrawn, and the suggestions he has conveyed.\n\nThus it has been with that which, following German example, I have\ndenominated the Theo-mythology of Homer. By that term it seems not\nimproper to designate a mixture of theology and mythology, as these two\nwords are commonly understood. Theology I suppose to mean, a system\ndealing with the knowledge of God and the unseen world: mythology, a\nsystem conversant with the inventions of man concerning them. In the\nHomeric poems I find both of these largely displayed: but with this\ndifference, that the first was in visible decline, the second in such\nrapid and prolific development, that, while Homer is undoubtedly a\nwitness to older fable, which had already in his time become settled\ntradition, he is also in this department himself evidently and largely\na Maker and Inventor, and the material of the Greek mythology comes out\nof his hands far more fully moulded, and far more diversified, than it\nentered them.\n\nOf the fact that the Homeric religion does not present a consistent and\nhomogeneous whole, we have abundant evidence in the difficulties with\nwhich, so soon as the literary age of Greece began, expositors found\nthemselves incumbered; and which drove them sometimes upon allegory\nas a resource, sometimes, as in the case of Plato, upon censure and\nrepudiation[1].\n\n[1] Döllinger Heid. u. Jud. v. 1. p. 254.\n\n~_Extended relations of God to man._~\n\nI know not whether it has been owing to our somewhat narrow jealousies\nconcerning the function of Holy Scripture, or to our want of faith in\nthe extended Providence of God, and His manifestations in the world, or\nto the real incongruity in the evidence at our command, or to any other\ncause, but the fact, at least, seems to me beyond doubt, that our modes\nof dealing with the Homeric poems in this cardinal respect have been\neminently unsatisfactory. Those who have found in Homer the elements of\nreligious truth, have resorted to the far-fetched and very extravagant\nsupposition, that he had learned them from the contemporary Hebrews,\nor from the law of Moses. The more common and popular opinion[2] has\nperhaps been one, which has put all such elements almost or altogether\nout of view; one which has treated the Immortals in Homer as so many\nimpersonations of the powers of nature, or else magnified men, and\ntheir social life as in substance no more than as a reflection of his\npicture of heroic life, only gilded with embellishments, and enlarged\nin scale, in proportion to the superior elevation of its sphere. Few,\ncomparatively, have been inclined to recognise in the Homeric poems the\nvestiges of a real traditional knowledge, derived from the epoch when\nthe covenant of God with man, and the promise of a Messiah, had not yet\nfallen within the contracted forms of Judaism for shelter, but entered\nmore or less into the common consciousness, and formed a part of the\npatrimony of the human race[3].\n\n[2] See Heyne ad Il. i. 603; Terpstra, Antiquitas Homerica, i. 3. And\nso late as the Cambridge Essays 1856. p. 149.\n\n[3] See ‘Homerus, pt. i.’ by Archdeacon Williams: ‘Primitive\nTradition,’ 1843, by the same; Edinb. Rev. N^o. 155, art. Homerus, and\nthe reference, p. 50, to Cesarotti’s Ragionamento Storico-Critico.\n\nBut surely there is nothing improbable in the supposition, that in\nthe poems of Homer such vestiges may be found. Every recorded form of\nsociety bears some traces of those by which it has been preceded: and\nin that highly primitive form, which Homer has been the instrument\nof embalming for all posterity, the law of general reason obliges us\nto search for elements and vestiges belonging to one more primitive\nstill. And, if we are to inquire in the Iliad and the Odyssey for\nwhat belongs to antecedent manners and ideas, on what ground can it be\npronounced improbable, that no part of these earlier traditions should\nbe old enough to carry upon them the mark of belonging to the religion,\nwhich the Book of Genesis represents as brought by our first parents\nfrom Paradise, and as delivered by them to their immediate descendants\nin general? The Hebrew Chronology, considered in connection with the\nprobable date of Homer, would even render it difficult or irrational\nto proceed upon any other supposition: nor if, as by the Septuagint\nor otherwise, a larger period is allowed for the growth of our race,\nwill the state of this case be materially altered. For the facts must\nremain, that the form of society exhibited by Homer was itself in\nmany points essentially patriarchal, that it contains, in matter not\nreligious, such, for instance, as the episode of the Cyclops, clear\ntraces of a yet earlier condition yet more significant of a relation\nto that name, and that there is no broadly marked period of human\nexperience, or form of manners, which we can place between the great\ntrunk of human history in Holy Scripture, and this famed Homeric\nbranch, which of all literary treasures appears to be its eldest born.\nStanding next to the patriarchal histories of Holy Scripture, why\nshould it not bear, how can it not bear, traces of the religion under\nwhich the patriarchs lived?\n\nThe immense longevity of the early generations of mankind was eminently\nfavourable to the preservation of pristine traditions. Each individual,\ninstead of being as now a witness of, or an agent in, one or two\ntransmissions from father to son, would observe or share in ten times\nas many. According to the Hebrew Chronology, Lamech the father of\nNoah was of mature age before Adam died: and Abraham was of mature\nage before Noah died. Original or early witnesses, remaining so long\nas standards of appeal, would evidently check the rapidity of the\ndarkening and destroying process.\n\nLet us suppose that man now lived but twenty years, instead of\nfourscore. Would not this greatly quicken the waste of ancient\ntraditions? And is not the converse also true?\n\n~_Sufficiently proved from Holy Scripture._~\n\nCustom has made it with us second nature to take for granted a\nbroad line of demarcation between those who live within the pale of\nRevelation, and the residue of mankind. But Holy Scripture does not\nappear to recognise such a severance in any manner, until we come to\nthe revelation of the Mosaic law, which was like the erection of a\ntemporary shelter for truths that had ranged at large over the plain,\nand that were apparently in danger of being totally absorbed in the\nmass of human inventions. But before this vineyard was planted, and\nlikewise outside its fence, there were remains, smaller or greater,\nof the knowledge of God; and there was a recognised relation between\nJehovah and mankind, which has been the subject of record from time to\ntime, and the ground of acts involving the admonition, or pardon, or\ncorrection, or destruction, of individuals or communities.\n\nThe latest of these indications, such as the visit of the Wise Men from\nthe East, are not the most remarkable: because first the captivity in\nBabylon, and subsequently the dissemination of Jewish groups through so\nmany parts of the world, could not but lead to direct communications\nof divine knowledge, at least, in some small degree. From such causes,\nthere would be many a Cornelius before him who became the first-fruits\nof the Gentiles. Yet even the interest, which probably led to such\ncommunications from the Jew, must have had its own root in relics of\nprior tradition, which attested the common concern of mankind in Him\nthat was to come. But in earlier times, and when the Jewish nation\nwas more concentrated, and was certainly obscure, the vestiges of\nextra-patriarchal and extra-judaical relations between God and man\nare undeniable. They have been traced with clearness and ability in a\npopular treatise by the hand of Bishop Horsley[4].\n\n[4] Horsley’s Dissertation on the Prophecies of the Messiah dispersed\namong the heathen. See also Mr. Harvey’s Observations on the Gnostic\nSystem, pp. iii and seqq., prefixed to his S. Irenæus, Cambridge, 1857.\nWilliams’s Primitive Tradition, p. 9.\n\nLet us take, for instance, that case of extreme wickedness, which most\nseverely tries the general proposition. The punishment of Sodom and\nGomorrah for their sins was preceded by a declaration from the Most\nHigh, importing a direct relation with those guilty cities[5]; and two\nangels, who had visited Abraham on the plains of Mamre, ‘came to Sodom\nat even.’ Ruth the Moabitess was an ancestress, through king David,\nof our Lord. Rahab in Jericho, ‘by faith,’ as the Apostle assures us,\nentertained the spies of the Israelites. Job, living in a country\nwhere the worship of the sun was practised, had, as had his friends,\nthe knowledge of the true God. Melchizedek, the priest of On, whose\ndaughter Joseph married, and Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, are\nother conspicuous instances. Later in time, Nineveh, the great Assyrian\ncapital, received the message of the prophet Jonah, and repented at his\npreaching. Here the teaching organ was supplied from among the Jews:\nbut Balaam exhibits to us the gift of inspiration beyond their bounds.\nOnce more; many centuries after the Homeric manners had disappeared,\nand during the captivity, we find not only a knowledge of God, but\ndreams and signs vouchsafed to Assyrian kings, and interpreted for\nthem by the prophet Daniel. We have, in short, mingling with the whole\ncourse of the Old Testament, a stream of evidence which shows the\npartial remnants of the knowledge of God, apart from that main current\nof it which is particularly traced for us in the patriarchal and\nMosaic histories. Again, many centuries after Homer, when all traces\nof primitive manners had long vanished, still in the Prometheus of\nÆschylus, and in the Pollio of Virgil, we have signs, though I grant\nthey are faint ones, that the celestial rays had not even then ‘faded\ninto the light of common day’ for the heathen world. It would really\nbe strange, and that in a high degree, if a record like that of Homer,\nwith so many resemblances to the earliest manners in other points, had\nno link to connect it with them in their most vital part.\n\n[5] See Genesis xviii. 1, 20. xx. 1. Heb. xi. 31.\n\n~_The question one of history._~\n\nThe general proposition, that we may expect to find the relics of\nScriptural traditions in the heroic age of Greece, though it leads,\nif proved, to important practical results, is independent even of a\nbelief in those traditions, as they stand in the scheme of revealed\ntruth. They must be admitted to have been facts on earth, even by those\nwho would deny them to be facts of heavenly origin, in the shape in\nwhich Christendom receives them: and the question immediately before\nus is one of pure historical probability. The descent of mankind from\na single pair, the lapse of that pair from original righteousness,\nare apart from and ulterior to it. We have traced the Greek nation\nto a source, and along a path of migration, which must in all\nlikelihood have placed its ancestry, at some point or points, in close\nlocal relations with the scenes of the earliest Mosaic records: the\nretentiveness of that people equalled its receptiveness, and its close\nand fond association with the past made it prone indeed to incorporate\nnovel matter into its religion, but prone also to keep it there after\nits incorporation.\n\nIf such traditions existed, and if the laws which guide historical\ninquiry require or lead us to suppose that the forefathers of the\nGreeks must have lived within their circle, then the burden of proof\nmust lie not so properly with those who assert that the traces of them\nare to be found in the earliest, that is, the Homeric, form of the\nGreek mythology, as with those who deny it. What became of those old\ntraditions? They must have decayed and disappeared, not by a sudden\nprocess, but by a gradual accumulation of the corrupt accretions, in\nwhich at length they were so completely interred as to be invisible\nand inaccessible. Some period therefore there must have been, at which\nthey would remain clearly perceptible, though in conjunction with much\ncorrupt matter. Such a period might be made the subject of record, and\nif such there were, we might naturally expect to find it in the oldest\nknown work of the ancient literature.\n\nIf the poems of Homer do, however, contain a picture, even though a\ndefaced picture, of the primeval religious traditions, it is obvious\nthat they afford a most valuable collateral support to the credit of\nthe Holy Scripture, considered as a document of history. Still we must\nnot allow the desire of gaining this advantage to bias the mind in an\ninquiry, which can only be of value if it is conducted according to the\nstrictest rules of rational criticism.\n\n~_Invention combined with tradition._~\n\nWe may then, in accordance with those rules, be prepared to expect\nthat the Hellenic religion will prove to have been in part constructed\nfrom traditional knowledge. The question arises next, Of what other\nmaterials in addition was it composed? The answer can be but one;\nSuch materials would be supplied by invention. But invention cannot\nabsolutely create; it can only work upon what it finds already provided\nto its hand. The provision made in this instance was simply that with\nwhich the experience of man supplied him. It was mediate or immediate:\nmediate, where the Greek received matter from abroad, and wrought upon\nit: immediate, where he conceived it for himself. That experience lay\nin two spheres--the sphere of external nature, and the sphere of life.\nEach of these would afford for the purpose the elements of Power,\nGrandeur, Pleasure, Beauty, Utility; and such would be the elements\nsuited to the work of constructing or developing a system that was to\npresent objects for his worship. We may therefore reasonably expect\nto find in the religion features referable to these two departments\nfor their origin;--first, the powerful forces and attractive forms of\noutward nature; secondly, the faculties and propensities of man, and\nthose relations to his fellow-men, amidst which his lot is cast, and\nhis character formed.\n\nIf this be so, then, in the result thus compounded out of tradition\npurporting to be revealed, and out of invention strictly human, we\nought to recognise, so long as both classes of ingredients are in\neffective coexistence, not strictly a false theology, but a true\ntheology falsified: a true religion, into which falsehood has entered,\nand in which it is gradually overlaying and absorbing the original\ntruth, until, when the process has at length reached a certain point,\nit is wholly hidden and borne down by countervailing forces, so that\nthe system has for practical purposes become a false one, and both may\nand should be so termed and treated.\n\nI admit that very different modes of representing the case have been\nin vogue. Sometimes by those to whom the interest of Christianity\nis precious, and sometimes in indifference or hostility to its\nfortunes, it is held that the basis of the Greek mythology is laid in\nthe deification of the powers of nature. The common assumptions have\nbeen such as the following: That the starting-point of the religion\nof the heroic age is to be sought only in the facts of the world, in\nthe ideas and experience of man. That nature-worship, the deification\nof elemental and other physical powers, was the original and proper\nbasis of the system. That this system, presumably self-consistent,\nas having been founded on a given principle, was broken up by the\nintervention of theogonic revolutions. That the system, of which\nJupiter was at the head, was an imperfect reconstruction of a scheme of\ndivine rule out of the fragments of an earlier religion, and that it\nsupplanted the elder gods. In short, the Greek mythology is represented\nas a corrupt edition, not of original revealed religion, but of a\nNature-worship which, as it seems to be assumed, was separated by a\ngulf never measured, and never passed, from the primitive religious\ntraditions of our race. Further it seems to be held, that the faults\nand imperfections of the pagan religion have their root only in a\nradical inability of the human mind to produce pure deity; that they do\nnot represent the depravation of an ancient and divine gift, but rather\nthe simple failure of man in a work of invention. Indeed, we need not\nwonder that it should fail in a process which, critically considered,\ncan mean little else than mere exaggeration of itself and from its own\nexperience[6], and which must be so apt to become positive caricature.\n\n[6] See Nägelsbach, Homerische Theologie, i. 1. ii. 1. Also (if I\nunderstand it rightly), Döllinger’s Heidenthum und Judenthum, ii. 1. §.\n1. p. 54.\n\n~_The basis was not in Nature-worship._~\n\nAgain, Dean Prideaux, in his Connection of Sacred and Profane History,\ngives the following genesis of the Greek mythology. From the beginning,\nhe says, there was a general notion among men, founded on a sense that\nthey were impure, of the necessity of a mediator with God. There being\nno mediator clearly revealed, man chose mediators for himself, and took\nthe sun, moon, and stars, as high intelligences well fitted for the\npurpose. Hence we find Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Apollo, Mercury, Venus,\nand Diana, to be first ranked in the polytheism of the ancients: for\nthey were their first gods[7].\n\n[7] Prideaux, i. 3. vol. i. p. 198.\n\nThis theory is not in correspondence with the facts of the heroic age.\nThere is no sense whatever of an impurity disabling men from access\nto God; no clear or general opinion of the necessity of mediation; no\nglimpse even of a god superior to Jupiter and the rest with whom they\nwere on behalf of man to mediate.\n\nAnd, again, the opinion, that the origin of the religion lay in\nNature-worship, has had the support both of high and also of recent\nauthorities. The eminent and learned Dr. Döllinger, in his ‘Heidenthum\nund Judenthum,’ says, that the deification of Nature, its forces,\nor the particular objects it offered to the senses, constituted the\ngroundwork of the Greek, as well as of the other heathen religions. The\nidea of God continued to be powerful even when it had been darkened,\nand the godhead was felt as present, and active everywhere in the\nphysical order. In working out his general rule for each mythological\ndeity in particular, this author conceives the original form of their\nexistence to have been that of a Nature-power, even where the vestiges\nof such a conception have, under subsequent handling, become faint\nor imperceptible. Thus Juno, Minerva, Latona, Diana, and others in\nsuccession, are referred to such an origin[8].\n\n[8] Heidenthum und Judenthum, b. ii. sect. 1, 2. pp. 54-81.\n\nNow in dealing with this hypothesis, I would ask, what then has become\nof the old Theistic and Messianic traditions? and how has it happened\nthey have been amputated by a process so violent as to make them to\nleave, even while the state of society continued still primitive, no\ntrace behind them? But further. I would urge with confidence that the\nample picture of the religion of the heroic ages, as we have it in\nHomer, which is strictly for this purpose in the nature of a fact,\ncannot be made to harmonize with the hypothesis which refers it to\nsuch a source. The proof of this statement must depend mainly on the\nexamination which we have to institute in detail: but I am anxious\nat once to bring it into view, and to refer briefly to some of the\ngrounds on which it rests, because it is susceptible of demonstration\nby evidence as contradistinguished from theory. On the other hand,\nwhen I proceed farther, evidence and theory must of necessity be mixed\nup together; and dissent from a particular mode of tracing out the\nassociation between the traditional and inventive elements of the\nsystem might unawares betray the reader into the conclusion, that no\nsuch distinct traditional elements were to be found, but that all,\nor nearly all, was pure fable. I say, then, there is much in the\ntheo-mythology of Homer, which, if it had been a system founded in\nfable, could not have appeared there. It stands before us like one of\nour old churches, having different parts of its fabric in the different\nstyles of architecture, each of which speaks for itself, and which we\nknow to belong to the several epochs in the history of the art, when\ntheir characteristic combinations were respectively in vogue.\n\n~_Nor is the system from invention only._~\n\nWhile on the one hand it has deities, such as Latona, without any\nattributes at all, on the other hand, we find in it both gods and\ngoddesses, with an assemblage of such attributes and functions as have\nno common link by which invention could have fastened them together.\nThey are such, likewise, as to bring about cross divisions and cross\npurposes, that the Greek force of imagination, and the Greek love of\nsymmetry, would have alike eschewed. How could invention have set\nup Pallas as the goddess at once of peace and its industries, of\nwisdom, and of war? Its object would clearly have been to impersonate\nattributes; and to associate even distinct, much less conflicting\nattributes, in the same deity, would have been simply to confuse them.\nHow again could it have combined in Apollo, who likewise turns the\ncourses of rivers by his might, the offices of destruction, music,\npoetry, prophecy, archery, and medicine? Again, if he is the god of\nmedicine, why have we Paieon? if of poetry, why have we the Muses? If\nMinerva be (as she is) goddess of war, why have we Mars? if of the work\nof the Artificer, why have we also Vulcan? if of prudence and sagacity,\nand even craft[9], why Mercury?\n\n[9] Il. xxii. 247.\n\nAnd again, the theory is, that the chief personages of the mythology\nare representatives of the great powers of the physical universe. I\nask, therefore, how it happens that in the Homeric, or, as we may call\nit, primitive form of the system, these great powers of the universe\nare for the most part very indistinctly and partially personified,\nwhereas we see in vivid life and constant movement another set of\nfigures, having either an obscure or partial relation, or no relation\nat all, to those powers? Such a state of the evidence surely strikes\nat the very root of the hypothesis we are considering: but it is\nthe state of the evidence which we actually find before us. Take for\ninstance Time, Ocean, Earth, Sun, Moon, Stars, Air; all these prime\nnatural objects and agents are either not personified at all in Homer,\nor so indistinctly and mutely personified that they are the mere\nzoophytes of his supernatural world, of which the gorgeous life and\nbrilliant movement are sustained by a separate set of characters.\nOf these more effective agents, some are such as it is impossible\nrationally to set down for mere impersonations of ideas; while others\nare plainly constituted as lords over, and not beings derivative from,\nthose powers or provinces of nature, with which they are placed in\nspecial relations. It cannot for instance rationally be said that the\nHomeric Jupiter is a mere impersonation of the air which he rules, or\nthe Homeric Neptune of the sea, or the Homeric Aidoneus (or Aides) of\nthe nether world. For to the first of these three, many functions are\nassigned having no connection with the air. As for example, when he\ngives swiftness of foot to Æneas on Mount Ida, that he might escape\nthe pursuit of Achilles[10]. In the case of the second, there is a\nrival figure, namely, Nereus, who never that we know of leaves the sea,\nwho is the father of the Sea-nymphs, and who evidently fulfils the\nconditions of Sea impersonated far better than does Neptune; Neptune,\nwho marched upon the battle-field in Troas, and who, with Apollo, had\nhimself built the walls of Ilium. Besides all this, the sea, to which\nNeptune belongs, is itself not one of the great elemental powers of\nthe universe, but is derived, like rivers, springs, and wells, from\nFather Ocean, who fears indeed the thunderbolt of Jupiter, but is not\nbound to attendance even in the great chapter of Olympus[11]. As\nto Aidoneus, he can hardly impersonate the nether world, because in\nHomer he does not represent or govern it, but only has to do with that\nportion of it, which is inhabited by the souls of departed men. For,\nas far beneath his realm as Earth is beneath Heaven, lies the dark\nTartarus of Homer, peopled with Κρόνος and his Titans. Nor, on the\nother hand, do we know that the Elysian fields of the West were subject\nto his sway. The elemental powers are in Homer, though not altogether,\nyet almost altogether, extrinsic to his grand Olympian system.\n\n[10] Il. xx. 92.\n\n[11] Il. xxi. 195-9. xx. 7.\n\nWithout, then, anticipating this or that particular result from\nthe inquiry into the mode and proportions in which traditional and\ninventive elements are combined in the poems of Homer, it may safely\nbe denied that his picture of the supernatural world could have been\ndrawn by means of materials exclusively supplied by invention from the\nsources of nature and experience.\n\n~_Traditive origin of Sacrifice._~\n\nAnd indeed there is one particular with respect to which the admission\nwill be generally made, that the Greek mythological system stood\nindebted at least to a primitive tradition, if not to a direct command;\nI mean the institution of sacrifice. This can hardly be supposed to\nhave been an original conception in every country; and it distinctly\npoints us to one common source. Sacrifice was, according\n"
