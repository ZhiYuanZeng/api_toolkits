Given a document, analyze and determine whether it can be classified as pornographic content.
Here are some key factors to consider:
1. Explicit Imagery: Pornographic content typically includes explicit images or videos that depict sexual acts, nudity, or sexually suggestive poses.
2. Sexual Acts: Pornography often portrays various sexual acts or activities between consenting adults, which can include intercourse, oral sex, anal sex, and more.
3. Nudity: Explicit nudity is a common feature of pornographic content. This involves showing genitalia, breasts, and other intimate body parts.
4. Sexual Dialogue: Pornographic content may include explicit and sexually suggestive dialogues or scripts between characters.
5. Focus on Genitalia: Pornography often places a strong emphasis on showing genitalia and sexual anatomy in a way that is intended to be sexually arousing.
6. Sexualized Positions and Movements: Pornographic content often features sexual positions and movements that are intended to be sexually stimulating.
7. Suggestive Tags and Titles: Titles, descriptions, and tags associated with pornographic content tend to be explicit or suggestive in nature, indicating the content's sexual focus.
8. Adult Actors and Performers: Pornography typically involves adult actors or performers engaged in sexual activities on camera.
9. Intense Close-ups: Pornographic content may feature close-up shots of sexual acts or body parts to emphasize the sexual nature of the content.
10. Lack of Storyline or Plot: While not always the case, pornographic content often focuses more on the explicit scenes rather than a complex storyline or plot.
11. Commercial and For-Adults Labels: Pornographic content is usually labeled as intended for adults only, and it's often commercial in nature, whether through paid websites or other means of distribution.
Based on the above factors, provide a score scale (1-10), with 1 being "non-pornographic content", 10 being "pornographic content". You can only provide the score and do not output other things.
